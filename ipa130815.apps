13702444,20130815,20130207725,RESONATOR CIRCUIT AND AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT,"A passive frequency divider in a CMOS process. More specifically, an electrical distributed parametric oscillator to realize a passive CMOS frequency divider with low phase noise. Instead of using active devices, which are the main sources of noise and power consumption, an oscillation at half of the input frequency is sustained by the parametric process based on nonlinear interaction with the input signal. For example, one embodiment is a 20 GHz frequency divider utilizing a CMOS varactor and made in a 0.13 μm CMOS process. In this embodiment: (i) without any dc power consumption, 600 mV differential output amplitude can be achieved for an input amplitude of 600 mV; and (ii) the input frequency ranged from 18.5 GHz to 23.5 GHz with varactor tuning. In this embodiment, the output phase noise is almost 6 dB lower than that of the input signal for all offset frequencies up to 1 MHz. Also, a resonant parametric amplifier with a low noise figure (NF) by exploiting the noise squeezing effect. Noise squeezing occurs through the phase-sensitive amplification process and suppresses one of two quadrature components in input noise. When the input signal is only in the direction of the non-suppressed quadrature component, squeezing can lower that NF by almost 3 dB. The resonant structure of the proposed amplifier achieves the squeezing effect using a low number of LC elements.",[Ehsan Afshari][Wooram Lee],[CORNELL UNIVERSITY],"The present application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/351,964, filed on Jun. 7, 2010; all of the foregoing patent-related document(s) are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their respective entirety(ies).",20110607,The U.S. Government grant(s) relating to this invention that may be required to be set forth in this document are as follows: CAREER award Grant No. 0954537 awarded by the National Science Foundation.,"","",20130403,PCT/US11/39451

13702603,20130815,20130210680,SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR AMPLIFICATION AND PHAGE DISPLAY,"The present invention generally relates to amplification of biological entities, for example, for phage display. In one aspect, members of a library of biological entities are encapsulated in separate compartments (e.g., in separate microfluidic droplets) and amplified. As a specific example, by putting members of a phage display library into microfluidic droplets such that no droplet contains more than one member of the library, the library can be amplified without any substantial changes in growth rates or population distributions, or other artifacts created due to differences in growth rates or amplification between different members of the library. In some cases, the volume of the compartments can be used to control the copy number of a biological entity during amplification. In certain cases, biological entities with different amplification rates can be amplified independently of each other. In some embodiments, the ratio of a rapidly amplifying biological entity to a slowly amplifying biological entity can be controlled. This can be advantageous, for example, in preserving diversity within a library by preventing rapidly amplifying biological entities from outcompeting slowly amplifying biological entities. For example, certain methods and systems of the invention can be useful in situations where preferential amplification of library members can present a problem.",[Ratmir Derda][Sindy K.Y.

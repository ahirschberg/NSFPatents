13640034,20130801,20130198522,SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FILE ACCESS AUDITING,"Systems and methods for providing an auditing file system for theft-prone devices are disclosed. The auditing file system supports fine-grained file auditing: a user may obtain reliable, explicit evidence that no files have been accessed after a device's loss. A user may also disable future file access after a device's loss, even in the absence of device network connectivity. In one embodiment, files are encrypted locally but the encryption keys are stored remotely, so that an audit server is queried for encryption keys to access protected files. By configuring the audit server to refuse to return a particular file's key, the user can prevent new accesses after the device is lost.",[Tadayoshi Kohno][Roxana Geambasu][Henry Levy][Steven Gribble],"","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/322,202, filed Apr. 8, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.",20110408,This invention was made with Government support under grant numbers CNS-0614975 and CNS-0430477 awarded by the NSF.

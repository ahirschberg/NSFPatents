In one example, a decrease in pressure is effected at the outlet by simultaneously increasing the resistance of the variable-resistance element and increasing the volume of the variable-volume element. Some embodiments of the regulator are particularly useful to effect long-term and high-speed pressure changes in high-resistance fluidic channel networks.",[Yong-Tae Kim][Brandon Kuczenski][Philip LeDuc][William Messner],[CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY],"This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

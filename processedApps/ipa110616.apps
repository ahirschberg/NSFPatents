Specifically, ranking algorithms are applied to learn a ranking function that advantageously minimizes ranking error as a function of targeted ranking order discrepancies between a predetermined first ranking of a training plurality of data elements and a second ranking of the training plurality of data elements by the ranking function. The ranking algorithms taught may be applied to ranking representations of chemical structures and may be particularly advantageous in the field of drug discovery, e.g., for prioritizing chemical structures for drug screenings.",[Shivani Agarwal],[MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY],"The present application claims the benefit of provisional patent application entitled &#x201C;Methods Systems and Media Utilizing Ranking Techniques in Machine Learning For Prioritizing Representations of Chemical Structures&#x201D; which was filed on Dec. 14, 2009 and assigned Ser.

12478687,20091224,20090316763,SPATIAL MULTIPLEXING GAIN FOR A DISTRIBUTED COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM USING RANDOMIZED CODING,"Multiple cooperative relays operate in a highly mobile environment and form a virtual antenna array. Multiple independent streams of data can be simultaneously transmitted in parallel to the destination receiver. Thus a higher spatial multiplexing gain can be obtained. Such exemplary embodiments might do so by allowing each relay to transmit a linear combination of antenna waveforms according to an independently and randomly generated coefficient vector. This randomized cooperation scheme may be useful in an environment in which a group of relay devices are close to the source device, and can therefore receive information at a high rate. Each relay device that receives the information without errors splits it into multiple streams. For example, if the relay devices receive B symbols and the number of streams is K, each stream contains B/K symbols. Each relay device then generates a random linear combination of all the streams and transmits this output simultaneously with the other relay devices.",[Elza Erkip][Thanasic Korakis][Pei Liu][Shivendra S.

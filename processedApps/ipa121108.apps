13455035,20121108,20120283948,Hierarchical and Exact Fastest Path Computation in Time-dependent Spatial Networks,"With real-world spatial networks the edge travel-times are time-dependent, where the arrival-time to an edge determines the actual travel-time on the edge. To speed up the path computation, exact and approximate techniques for computation of the fastest path in time-dependent spatial networks are presented. An exact fastest path computation technique based on a time-dependent A* search can significantly improve the computation time and storage complexity of existing approaches. Moreover, for applications with which approximate fastest path is acceptable, the approximate fastest path computation technique can improve the computation time by an order of magnitude while maintaining high accuracy (e.g., with only 7% increase in travel-time of the computed path on average). With experiments using real data-sets (including a variety of large spatial networks with real traffic data) the efficacy of the disclosed techniques for online fastest path computation is demonstrated.","",[UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA],"This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional application entitled &#x201C;Hierarchical and Exact Fastest Path Computation in Time-dependent Spatial Networks&#x201D;, filed May 3, 2011, Application Ser.

The first stage compresses a set of anomaly signals using a principal component analysis and passes the resulting eigensignals and a small set of other signals to the second stage, a lag correlation detector, which identifies time-delayed correlations. Real use cases are described from eight unmodified production systems.","","[The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford, Junior, University]","",20110506,This invention was made with Government support under contract 0915766 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

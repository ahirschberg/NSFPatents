11937736,20080731,20080179433,Fluidized Bed Systems And Methods Including Micro-Jet Flow,"Methods and systems for enhancing fluidization of nanoparticle and/or nanoagglomerates are provided. A fluidization chamber is provided with a fluidizing medium (e.g., a fluidizing gas) directed in a first fluidizing direction, e.g., upward into and through a bed containing a volume of nanoparticles and/or nanopowders. A second source of air/gas flow is provided with respect to the fluidization chamber, the secondary air/gas flow generally being oppositely (or substantially oppositely) directed relative to the fluidizing medium. Turbulence created by the secondary gas flow, e.g., a jet from a micro-jet nozzle, is advantageously effective to aerate the agglomerates and the shear generated by the jet is advantageously effective to break apart nanoagglomerates and/or reduce the tendency for nanoagglomerates to form or reform. A downwardly directed source of secondary gas flow located near the main gas distributor leads to full fluidization of the entire amount of powder in the column. In addition, the oppositely directed fluid flow facilitates powder circulation within the fluidization chamber, thereby enhancing fluidization results. Use of oppositely directed fluid flow is believed to transition a bed that is exhibiting agglomerate bubbling fluidization (ABF) behavior into a bed that exhibits agglomerate particulate fluidization (APF) behavior",[Robert Pfeffer][Jose A. Quevedo][Juergen Flesch],[NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY][EVONIK DEGUSSA GMBH],"The present application claims the benefit of a co-pending, provisional patent application entitled &#x201C;Fluidization System Enhanced by Micro-Jet Flow,&#x201D; which was filed on Nov. 10, 2006 and assigned Ser.

11972754,20080731,20080179514,AMBIENT PRESSURE PYROELECTRIC ION SOURCE FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY,"A compact, low power ambient pressure pyroelectric ionization source. The source can be constructed using a z-cut lithium niobate or lithium tantalate crystal with an attached resistive heater mounted in front of the atmospheric pressure inlet of an ion trap mass spectrometer. Positive and negative ion formation alternately results from thermally cycling the crystal over a narrow temperature range. Ionization of molecules such as 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol or benzoic acid results in the observation of the singly deprotonated species and their clusters in the negative ion mass spectrum. Ionization of molecules such as triethylamine or triphenylamine with the source results in observation of the corresponding singly protonated species of each in the positive ion mass spectrum. The pyroelectric crystals are thermally cycled by as little as 30 K from ambient temperature. Ion formation is largely unaffected by contamination of the crystal faces. This ion source is robust.",[Jesse L. Beauchamp][Evan L.

Methods of making these devices, which can include hollow and/or porous microneedles, are also provided. A preferred method for making a microneedle includes forming a micromold having sidewalls which define the outer surface of the microneedle, electroplating the sidewalls to form the hollow microneedle, and then removing the micromold from the microneedle. In a preferred method of use, the microneedle device is used to deliver fluid material into or across a biological barrier from one or more chambers in fluid connection with at least one of the microneedles. The device preferably further includes a means for controlling the flow of material through the microneedles. Representative examples of these means include the use of permeable membranes, fracturable impermeable membranes, valves, and pumps.",[Mark G. Allen][Mark R. Prausnitz][Devin V.

12795273,20101209,20100312365,ADAPTIVE NOTCH FILTER,"The control of flexible systems is often difficult due to the exact frequencies of the elastic modes being hard to identify. These flexible modes may change over time, or vary between units of the same system. The variation in the modal dynamics may cause a degradation in performance or even instabilities unless compensated for by the control scheme. Controllers designed for these types of systems use notch filters for mode suppression. However variation in the parameters of the flexible modes may cause the need for wide notch filters. An adaptive scheme is proposed which uses an online estimator based on plant parameterization. The scheme may not use probe signals and may not rely on exact parameter identification of the unknown parameters. Instead it may continuously update itself to cancel the effect of the flexible modes by been able to identify the effect of the modal dynamics on the performance of the system. The adaptive notch filter can be designed narrower, adding less phase lag at lower frequencies, thereby allowing an increase in bandwidth and disturbance rejection capability. Simulation and experimental verification of the adaptive mode suppression scheme is given through the use of a laser beam pointing system. The adaptive scheme is compared to a non-adaptive scheme, and is able to decrease the standard deviation of the experimentally measured tracking error by 14% even when the flexible dynamics are unknown.",[JASON LEVIN][PETROS IOANNOU],[UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA],"This application is based upon and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/184,583, entitled &#x201C;ADAPTIVE NOTCH FILTER FOR FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS,&#x201D; filed Jun. 5, 2009, attorney docket number 028080-0475.

The method includes specifying data uncertainty using at least one variable generation (VG) function, wherein the VG function generates pseudorandom samples of uncertain data values. A random database based on the VG function is specified. and multiple Monte Carlo instantiations of the random database are generated. Using a Monte Carlo method, a query is repeatedly executed over the multiple Monte Carlo instantiations to output a Monte Carlo method result and associated query-results. The Monte Carlo method result may then be used to estimate statistical properties of a probability distribution of the query-result.",[Peter Jay Haas][Ravindranath Jampani][Chistopher Matthew Jermaine][Luis Leopoldo Perez][Mingxi Wu][Fei Xu],[International Business Machines Corporation],"",20090603,This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers 0612170 and 0347408 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

In one aspect, multiple emulsions are formed using a plurality of channels, such as microfluidic channels, that meet at a common intersection. The multiple emulsions may be created at a single common intersection in some embodiments, unlike other prior art systems where multiple channel intersections are required to create multiple emulsions. For instance, in one set of embodiments, three, four, or more microfluidic channels may intersect at a common intersection, with two or three serving as inlets and one serving as the outlet. In some embodiments, a first fluidic channel may be relatively hydrophobic, while a second fluidic channel is relatively hydrophilic. The third channel, if present, may be relatively hydrophilic or hydrophobic, depending on the application. The outlet channel may be hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or may comprise at least one portion that is relatively hydrophilic and at least one portion that is relatively hydrophilic. By controlling the flow of fluids through the hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions of the channels, multiple emulsions may be created proximate the common intersection, due to interactions between the fluids entering the common intersection. In other embodiments, different patterns of hydrophilic or hydrophobic channels may be used.

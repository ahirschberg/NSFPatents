Techniques for automated segmentation convert imaging intensity to a signed distance function (SDF), and a voxel structure imposes a uniform sampling grid. Essential properties of the SDF are used to construct upper and lower bounds on the allowed variation in signed distance in 1, 2, and 3 (or more) dimensions. The bounds are combined to produce interval-valued extensions of the SDF, including a tight global extension and more computationally efficient local bounds that provide useful criteria for root exclusion/isolation, enabling modeling of the objects and other applications.",[Duane Storti][Mark Ganter],[University of Washington],"This application is a continuation-in-part of a copending patent application, &#x201C;Three Dimensional Modeling of Objects,&#x201D; Ser.

12058105,20091001,20090244300,METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MOTION INVARIANT IMAGING,"Object motion during camera exposure often leads to noticeable blurring artifacts. Proper elimination of this blur is challenging because the blur kernel is unknown, varies over the image as a function of object velocity, and destroys high frequencies. In the case of motions along a 1D direction (e.g. horizontal), applicants show that these challenges can be addressed using a camera that moves during the exposure. Through the analysis of motion blur as space-time integration, applicants show that a parabolic integration (corresponding to constant sensor acceleration) leads to motion blur that is not only invariant to object velocity, but preserves image frequency content nearly optimally. That is, static objects are degraded relative to their image from a static camera, but all moving objects within a given range of motions reconstruct well. A single deconvolution kernel can be used to remove blur and create sharp images of scenes with objects moving at different speeds, without requiring any segmentation and without knowledge of the object speeds.",[Anat Levin][Peter Sand][Taeg Sang Cho][Fredo Durand][Willliam T.

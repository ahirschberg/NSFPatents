11416449,20070111,20070006926,Microfluidic bubble logic devices,"An all fluid-based no-moving part micro-mechanical logic family of microfluidic bubble logic devices is constructed from complex sequences of microfluidic channels, microfluidic bubble modulators for programming the devices, and microfluidic droplet/bubble memory elements for chemical storage and retrieval. The input is a sequence of bubbles/droplets encoding information, with the output being another sequence of bubbles/droplets. For performing a set of reactions/tasks, the modulators program the device by producing a precisely timed sequence of bubbles/droplets, resulting in a cascade of logic operations within the microfluidic channel sequence, utilizing the generated bubbles as a control. The devices are based on the principle of minimum energy interfaces formed between the two fluid phases enclosed inside precise channel geometries. Various devices, including logic gates, non-volatile bistable memory, shift registers, multiplexers, and ring oscillators have been designed and fabricated.

The method includes forming a connector on a semiconductor substrate, coating the connector with a polymer layer, and immersing the semiconductor substrate and the coated connector in an etchant solution to form the microstructure from the semiconductor substrate and to release the coated connector and the microstructure from the semiconductor substrate such that the microstructure remains coupled to a further element of the device via the coated connector. In some cases, the microstructure is defined by forming an etch stop in the semiconductor substrate, and the microstructure and the semiconductor substrate are coated with a polymer layer, which may then be selectively patterned. The microstructure may then be released from the semiconductor substrate in accordance with the etch stop.

11450155,20070111,20070009120,Dynamic binaural sound capture and reproduction in focused or frontal applications,"A new approach to capturing and reproducing either live or recorded three-dimensional sound is described. Called MTB2.5 for “Motion-Tracked Binaural 2.5,” the method employs six real or simulated microphones, a head tracker, and special signal-processing procedures to combine the signals picked up by the microphones. In the microphone array, two central microphones are placed at the positions of the ears of a listener facing forward, and four peripheral microphones are located in pairs on either side of the central microphones. Only the low-frequency components of the four peripheral microphone signals are needed, and the total bandwidth required is approximately 2.5 times the bandwidth of one full-bandwidth audio channel. MTB2.5 achieves a high degree of realism by effectively placing the listener's ears in the space where the sounds are occurring, moving the virtual ears in synchrony with the listener's head motions. MTB2.5 also provides a universal format for recording spatial sound. ",[V. Algazi][Richard Duda][Dennis Thompson],""," This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser.

11525495,20080327,20080075145,Methods of discovering neighbors in opportunistic open access ad hoc wireless networks,"In an ad hoc wireless network, for purposes of neighbor discovery, a transmitting node transmits a beacon within a timeslot and at a frequency that varies from timeslot-to-timeslot according to one or more associated and known pseudo-random or cyclical frequency hopping sequences. When, during a timeslot, the frequency hopping sequence would select a beacon frequency that if transmitted would violate spectrum policy that is in place during that timeslot, then, during that timeslot, a beacon is not transmitted during that timeslot. During each timeslot, a neighbor receiving node attempts to detect and decode a transmitted beacon at a frequency specified by the frequency hopping sequence that it expects a transmitting node to be using. When a receiving node successfully detects and decodes a beacon transmitted by a transmitting node, neighbor discovery between the transmitting and receiving nodes is achieved.",[Krishna Balachandran][Joseph H.

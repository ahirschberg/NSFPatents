EP determines the pore size based on the evaporative mass loss at constant temperature from porous materials that have been pre-saturated with either a wetting or non-wetting volatile liquid. The saturated porous material is placed in an appropriate test cell on a conventional microbalance to measure liquid mass loss at a constant temperature as a function of time. The mass-loss rate is then related to the pore-size distribution. The microbalance permits measuring the mass as a function of time. The slope of the mass versus time curve is the evaporation rate. The evaporation rate is related to the vapor pressure at the interface between the liquid in the porous material and the ambient gas phase. The vapor pressure in turn is related to the pore diameter.,[Alan R. Greenberg][William B.

A novel decontamination system contains highly uniform carbon microspheres preferably in the optimal size range for transport through the soil. The microspheres are preferably enveloped in a polyelectrolyte (such as carboxymethyl cellulose, CMC) to which preferably a bimetallic nanoparticle system of zerovalent iron and Pd is attached. The carbon serves as a strong adsorbent to TCE, while the bimetallic nanoparticles system provides the reactivity. The polyelectrolyte serves to stabilize the carbon microspheres in aqueous solution. The overall system resembles a colloidal micelle with a hydrophilic shell (the polyelectrolyte coating) and a hard hydrophobic core (carbon). In contact with bulk TCE, there is a sharp partitioning of the system to the TCE side of the interface due to the hydrophobicity of the core. These multifunctional systems appear to satisfy criteria related to remediation and are relatively inexpensive and made with potentially environmentally benign materials. An aerosol process is preferably used to produce zerovalent iron particles supported on carbon.

Emulsification of a water/surfactant /oil system results in the production of oil droplets and this depends on the formulation and composition variables, mixing characteristics and system preparation. Thus, research is ongoing on improving methods of cleaning up oil spills. Cactus mucilage was used to disperse and absorb oil from a simulated oil slick in different salt concentrations. Results show correlations between emulsion properties and interfacial characteristics of mucilage as function of aqueous phase salinity. Mucilage powder added to the oil floating on the water dispersed the oil film and absorbed the oil while remaining afloat, facilitates removal of the oil-mucilage aggregate.

An atom approaching the nanotube with a sub-threshold angular momentum is captured by the potential and eventually spirals towards the nanotube. The atom ionizes as in comes into close proximity with a sidewall of the nanotube, creating an ion whose polarity matches the polarity of the electric potential of the nanotube.

It is shown that PSCs can be directed to differentiate into intestinal tissue in vitro by modulating the combinatorial activities of several signaling pathways in a step-wise fashion, effectively recapitulating in vivo fetal intestinal al development. The resulting intestinal “organoids” were three-dimensional structures consisting of a polarized, columnar epithelium surrounded by mesenchyme that included a smooth muscle-like layer. The epithelium was patterned into crypt-like SOX9-positive proliferative zones and villus-like structures with all of the major functional cell types of the intestine. The culture system is used to demonstrate that expression of NEUROG3, a pro-endocrine transcription factor mutated in enteric anendocrinosis is sufficient to promote differentiation towards the enteroendocrine cell lineage.

The miRNAs or siRNAs guide cleavage of the transcript and set the register for production of siRNAs (usually 21 nucleotides in length) encoded adjacent to the initiation cleavage site within the construct. The method results in specific formation of siRNAs of predictable size and register (phase) relative to the initiation cleavage site. The method can be used to produce specific siRNAs in vivo for inactivation or suppression of one or more target genes or other entities, such as pathogens.",[James C.

13702444,20130815,20130207725,RESONATOR CIRCUIT AND AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT,"A passive frequency divider in a CMOS process. More specifically, an electrical distributed parametric oscillator to realize a passive CMOS frequency divider with low phase noise. Instead of using active devices, which are the main sources of noise and power consumption, an oscillation at half of the input frequency is sustained by the parametric process based on nonlinear interaction with the input signal. For example, one embodiment is a 20 GHz frequency divider utilizing a CMOS varactor and made in a 0.13 μm CMOS process. In this embodiment: (i) without any dc power consumption, 600 mV differential output amplitude can be achieved for an input amplitude of 600 mV; and (ii) the input frequency ranged from 18.5 GHz to 23.5 GHz with varactor tuning. In this embodiment, the output phase noise is almost 6 dB lower than that of the input signal for all offset frequencies up to 1 MHz. Also, a resonant parametric amplifier with a low noise figure (NF) by exploiting the noise squeezing effect. Noise squeezing occurs through the phase-sensitive amplification process and suppresses one of two quadrature components in input noise. When the input signal is only in the direction of the non-suppressed quadrature component, squeezing can lower that NF by almost 3 dB. The resonant structure of the proposed amplifier achieves the squeezing effect using a low number of LC elements.",[Ehsan Afshari][Wooram Lee],[CORNELL UNIVERSITY],"The present application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/351,964, filed on Jun. 7, 2010; all of the foregoing patent-related document(s) are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their respective entirety(ies).",20110607,The U.S. Government grant(s) relating to this invention that may be required to be set forth in this document are as follows: CAREER award Grant No. 0954537 awarded by the National Science Foundation.,"","",20130403,PCT/US11/39451

In one aspect, members of a library of biological entities are encapsulated in separate compartments (e.g., in separate microfluidic droplets) and amplified. As a specific example, by putting members of a phage display library into microfluidic droplets such that no droplet contains more than one member of the library, the library can be amplified without any substantial changes in growth rates or population distributions, or other artifacts created due to differences in growth rates or amplification between different members of the library. In some cases, the volume of the compartments can be used to control the copy number of a biological entity during amplification. In certain cases, biological entities with different amplification rates can be amplified independently of each other. In some embodiments, the ratio of a rapidly amplifying biological entity to a slowly amplifying biological entity can be controlled. This can be advantageous, for example, in preserving diversity within a library by preventing rapidly amplifying biological entities from outcompeting slowly amplifying biological entities.

The method does not depend on the use of DNA or synthetic constructs that contain inverted duplications or dual promoters so as to form perfect or largely double-stranded RNA. Rather, the method depends on constructs that yield single-stranded RNA transcripts, and exploits endogenous or in vivo-produced miRNAs or siRNAs to initiate production of siRNAs. The miRNAs or siRNAs guide cleavage of the transcript and set the register for production of siRNAs (usually 21 nucleotides in length) encoded adjacent to the initiation cleavage site within the construct. The method results in specific formation of siRNAs of predictable size and register (phase) relative to the initiation cleavage site.

These films are useful in detecting vapors of volatile organic compounds, and in determining their molecular weights. A quartz crystal microbalance-based sensor was designed by depositing a thin film of this composite material on the gold electrode surface of a quartz crystal resonator. The sensor exhibited rapid response toward a variety of volatile organic compounds, and complete regeneration, high sensitivity, low detection limits, and wide dynamic ranges. The ratio of the change in frequency to the change in motional resistance is a concentration-independent quantity that is proportional to the molecular weight of the absorbed chemical species.

Microfluidic systems can provide an advantageous environment for performing various reactions and analyses due to a reduction in sample and reagent quantities that are required, a reduction in the size of the operating system, and a decrease in reaction time compared to conventional systems. Unfortunately, the small size of microfluidic channels can sometimes result in difficulty in detecting a species without magnifying optics (such as a microscope or a photomultiplier). A series of tightly packed microchannels, i.e., a meandering region, or a wide channel having a dimension on the order of millimeters, can serve as a solution to this problem by creating a wide measurement area.

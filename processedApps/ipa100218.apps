A preferred embodiment employs a split loop filter architecture. Two loop filter halves separately drive half-sized parallel varactors in a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and also drive a differential-input lowpass frequency selective circuit, e.g., a differential-input integrator in a least mean squared (LMS) feedback loop. The output of the differential-input lowpass frequency selective circuit controls the gain matching of a phase noise cancellation path to minimize phase noise arising from quantization error associated with the sequence of divider modulus values in the fractional-N PLL. The two varactor capacitances add together in the VCO tank, so the VCO frequency depends on the common-mode loop filter voltage and is relatively insensitive to differential-mode voltage. In contrast, the differential integrator operates on the differential-mode voltage from the two loop filter halves but attenuates their common-mode voltage.",[Ian Galton][Ashok Swaminathan],[THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA],"This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119 from prior provisional application Ser.

In some embodiments, a method includes receiving rebroadcast transmissions of a data segment previously transmitted by the distribution center, the received segment including embedded information associated with a subset of recipients that includes at least one of the unauthorized distributors, and identifying the subset based on the embedded information. The method further includes assigning recipients in the identified subset into two or more new subsets such that the at least one unauthorized distributor is assigned to one of the two or more new subsets, and coding a subsequent data segment to be transmitted with additional embedded information associated with the two or more new subsets. The above operations may be repeated until the at least unauthorized distributor is identified.",[Aggelos Kiayias][Serdar Pehlivanoglu],[The University of Connecticut],"This application claims priority to provisional U.S. application Ser.

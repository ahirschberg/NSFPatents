10565551,20070315,20070057698,Dynamic and differential cmos logic with signal-independent power consumption to withstand differential power analysis,A dynamic and differential CMOS logic style is disclosed in which a gate uses a fixed amount of energy per evaluation event. The gate switches its output at every event and loads a constant capacitance. The logic style is a Dynamic and Differential Logic (DDL) style. The DDL style logic typically has one charging event per clock cycle and the charging event does not depend on the input signals. The differential feature masks the in-put value because a precharged output nodes is discharged during the evaluation phase. The dynamic feature breaks the input sequence: the discharged node is charged during the subsequent precharge phase. ,[Ingrid Verbauwhede][Kris Tri],""," The present application claims priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/504,380, filed Sep. 17, 2003, titled &#x201C;A DYNAMIC AND DIFFERENTiAL CMOS LOGIC WITH SIGNAL INDEPENDENT POWER CONSUMPTION TO WITHSTAND DIFFERENTIAL POWER ANALYSIS FOR SMART CARDS,&#x201D; the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.",20040917," This invention was made with Government support of Grant No. 0098361, awarded by the NSF.

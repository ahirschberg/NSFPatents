In preferred methods, a porous optical film is exposed to vapor which contains analyte. The porous optical film is heated and its optical response is monitored during heating. An optical response observed via heating can determine the identity and/or quantity of the analyte. In preferred embodiments, optical response during a thermal pulse is compared to a database of sensor responses that are characteristic of various analytes. Preferred methods are conducted a relatively low temperatures, for example below about 200Â° C. In preferred methods, a heating and cooling cycle produces a hysteresis curve in the optical response that is indicative of analytes.

Devices including the molecularly imprinted carbon and their use in methods of detecting analytes are also described. As an example, dibutyl butylphosphonate (DBBP), a surrogate for chemical warfare agents, was used as a template molecule. Electrospun molecularly imprinted SU-8 and pyrolyzed polymer (PP) solid-phase microextraction (SPME) devices were prepared; their ability to preferentially extract DBBP from an aqueous matrix, with and without interferences present, was evaluated via comparison with non-imprinted SU-8 and PP SPME fibers. The electrospun devices demonstrated a higher selectivity for DBBP, as evidenced by their extraction time profiles. The MI-SPME fibers tested extracted at least 60% more DBBP than their non-imprinted counterparts.",[Susan V. Olesik][Joseph W.

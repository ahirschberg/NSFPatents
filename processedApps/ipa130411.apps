The back reflector is an array of features of micrometer proportions. The feature may be concave or convex features such as hemispheres, hemi-ellipsoids, partial-spheres, partial-ellipsoids, or combinations thereof The feature may be pyramidal. A method of forming the back reflector array is by forming an array of features from a photocurable resin, subsequent curing the resin and metalizing the cured resin to render the surface reflective.

13687595,20130411,20130087507,USE OF CACTUS MUCILAGE AS A DISPERSANT AND ABSORBANT FOR OIL IN OIL-WATER MIXTURES,"Despite advances in off-shore oil exploration and drilling technology, accidental oil spills do occur. Depending on their magnitude and location, irreparable damage may be inflicted on marine and coastal ecosystems. Emulsification of a water/surfactant /oil system results in the production of oil droplets and this depends on the formulation and composition variables, mixing characteristics and system preparation. Thus, research is ongoing on improving methods of cleaning up oil spills. Cactus mucilage was used to disperse and absorb oil from a simulated oil slick in different salt concentrations. Results show correlations between emulsion properties and interfacial characteristics of mucilage as function of aqueous phase salinity. Mucilage powder added to the oil floating on the water dispersed the oil film and absorbed the oil while remaining afloat, facilitates removal of the oil-mucilage aggregate. This invention is a competitive treatment for oil spill remediation with the added advantage of being more environmentally friendly.",[Norma A. Alcantar][Dawn I.

The holographic basis of the measurement technique makes it highly susceptible to mechanical motion. The motility contrast application, in particular, preferably includes increased mechanical stability because the signal is based on time-varying changes caused by cellular motion, which should not be confused with mechanical motion of the system. Apparatus for motility contrast imaging that provides increased mechanical stability is disclosed. It is based on common-path configurations, in which the signal and reference beams share optical elements in their paths to the detector. The two beams share mechanical motions in common, and hence these motions do not contribute to the signal.",[David D.

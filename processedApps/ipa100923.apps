12727898,20100923,20100241378,Method and Apparatus for Compressive Parameter Estimation and Tracking,"We have developed a new method and apparatus for tracking and estimating parameters of locally oscillating signals from measurements that approximately preserve the inner product among signals in a class of signals of interest. Random demodulation, random sampling, and coset sampling are three prime examples of these techniques.One example of this is a compressive phase locked loops (PLL), which has a wide variety of applications, including but not limited to communications, phase tracking, robust control, sensing, and frequency modulation (FM) demodulation. The design modifies classical PLL designs to operate with CS-based sampling systems. By introducing a compressive sampler at the output of the oscillator and by appropriately adjusting the phase difference estimator we enable the use of PLLs with modern CS sampling technology. Other modifications can be made to reduce concerns such as normalization of the measurements, for example using the QCS-PLL.The concept of democracy is also introduced into a CS-PLL with quantization effects. Due to the universality of compressive measurements, we can drop a few saturated measurements, yet still get just as good or better performance than if we had allowed the quantizer to saturate.The CS-PLL and QCS-PLL enable one to track oscillating signals in very large bandwidths using a small number of measurements. In addition to potentially operating below the Nyquist rate, however, our new PLL designs offer very low computational complexity that does not involve intermediate compressive sensing signal reconstruction.",[Richard G.

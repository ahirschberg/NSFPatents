11765406,20080221,20080043787,NONLINEAR OPTICAL CRYSTALS AND THEIR MANUFACTURE AND USE,"Described are nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals, including aluminum-borate NLO crystals, that have low concentrations of contaminants that adversely affect the NLO crystal's optical properties, such as compounds that contain transition-metal elements and/or lanthanides, other than yttrium, lanthanum, and lutetium. Some NLO crystals with low concentrations of these contaminants are capable of second harmonic generation at very short wavelengths. Also described are embodiments of a method for making these NLO crystals. Some embodiments involve growing a single NLO crystal, such as an aluminum-borate NLO crystal, from a mixture containing a solvent that is substantially free of harmful contaminants. The described NLO crystals can be used, for example, in laser devices. ",[Douglas Keszler][Ning Ye],[]," This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

The assays disclosed in the present disclosure use the formation, disruption and destruction of self-assembling fluorescent dye:biopolymer complexes to indicate the presence or absence of an analyte of interest. Such assays are suitable for high throughput screening and can achieve high sensitivity due to the enhanced fluorescence and changes of absorption spectra of certain dyes, particularly cyanine dyes, when they bind to specific biopolymers.",[David G.

11410692,20080221,20080046187,"Method, system and software arrangement for detecting or determining similarity regions between datasets","Methods, systems, and computer-readable media are provided which can identify and provide local variations in regions of similarity among two or more data sets. These data sets may be represented as sequences such as, e.g., genomic sequences or words in a text. The local variations in similarity levels can be provided by selecting an initial prior distribution relating the data sets, organizing the first data set into windows and the remaining data sets into blocks, using the priors to sample one or more sets of words from the first data set, computing a similarity curve from exact and inexact matches for these words and, if convergence of results is not achieved, computing a new set of priors and repeating the sampling and computation of similarity curves. The computations can be performed using an amount of computational time that is linearly proportional to the size of the data sets. The exemplary embodiments of the present invention can use Bayesian estimators to determine local variations in similarity levels and to refine estimates of the probabilistic distributions between iterations.

The improved deep packet filter system is a hardware-based system with optimized logic area. One optimization technique is the sharing of common sub-logic in the hardware design to reduce the number of gates that are required. Another optimization technique is the use of a built-in memory to store portions of the pattern set, also resulting in a reduction of gates. The reduction of the logic area allows the deep packet filter system to be implemented onto a single field-programmable array chip.

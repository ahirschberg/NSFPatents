The present invention examines the sensor capability of WGM in a dielectric sphere coated with a thin uniform dielectric layer of a high refractive index. Among the utilities of such a modified resonator for the sensing are to have an evanescent field of a different penetration depth without using a non-silica based microsphere or changing the laser wavelength, to further enhance the sensitivity by drawing the optical field of WGM into the coating layer, and to realize the same relative shifts for WGM of different radial modes, thus eliminating ambiguities in the measurement of a refractive index change in the surrounding medium.

When used with multiple light sources, the transformation may be used to produce a specular invariant image. A diffuse RGB image can be obtained by applying a non-linear partial differential equation to an RGB image to iteratively erode the specular component at each pixel. An optional third dimension of time may be added for processing video images. After the specular and diffuse components are separated, dichromatic editing may be used to independently process the diffuse and the specular components to add or suppress visual effects.

Repression of gene expression is achieved through the presence of a regulatory nucleic acid element (the cis-repressive RNA or crRNA) within the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of an mRNA molecule. The nucleic acid element forms a hairpin (stem/loop) structure through complementary base pairing. The hairpin blocks access to the mRNA transcript by the ribosome, thereby preventing translation. In particular, in embodiments of the invention designed to operate in prokaryotic cells, the stem of the hairpin secondary structure sequesters the ribosome binding site (RBS). In embodiments of the invention designed to operate in eukaryotic cells, the stem of the hairpin is positioned upstream of the start codon, anywhere within the 5′ UTR of an mRNA. A small RNA (trans-activating RNA, or taRNA), expressed in trans, interacts with the crRNA and alters the hairpin structure. This alteration allows the ribosome to gain access to the region of the transcript upstream of the start codon, thereby activating transcription from its previously repressed state.

In the ‘off’ position of the detector, i.e., in the absence of target, the blocker strand and sensor strand are base-paired. As shown in FIG. , the formation of comparatively rigid, duplex DNA prevents the redox moiety from approaching the electrode surface, thereby suppressing Faradaic currents. When target is added to the system, the target displaces the blocker strand, binds to the sensor strand, liberating the end of the redox-labeled oligonucleotide to produce a flexible element. This, in turn, allows the redox moiety to collide with the electrode surface, producing a readily detectable Faradaic current.

11783393,20070823,20070198625,Conditional negating booth multiplier,"An angle rotator performs angle rotation of an input complex signal in the complex plane according to an angle θ. The angle rotator includes a coarse stage rotation and a fine stage rotation. The two specific amounts of rotation are obtained directly from the original angle, without performing iterations as are performed by known CORDIC-type methods. The coarse stage rotation is performed using truncated approximations for the cosine θand the sine θ, where θis a radian angle that corresponds to a most significant word (MSW) of the input angle θ. The fine stage rotation is performed using one or more error values that compensate for approximations and quantization errors associated with the coarse stage rotation. By partitioning the rotation into coarse and fine rotation stages, a two stage structure is obtained that requires much less hardware than a single-stage rotator, without sacrificing angle precision. This can occur because the two-stage rotator stores pre-computed cosine θand the sine θvalues in a small lookup table (e.g. memory device) for fast retrieval. Furthermore, the angle rotator consolidates all operations into a small number of reduced-size multipliers, enabling the use of efficient multiplier implementations, such as Booth encoding, thereby yielding a smaller and faster overall circuit. When higher precision is desired, more accurate results can be attained simply by increasing the wordlength and the multiplier size, without significantly increasing overall circuit latency.

10869489,20070913,20070209576,FORMATION OF METAL OXIDE NANOWIRE NETWORKS (NANOWEBS) OF LOW-MELTING METALS,"A method of producing networks of low melting metal oxides such as crystalline gallium oxide comprised of one-dimensional nanostructures. Because of the unique arrangement of wires, these crystalline networks defined as “nanowebs”, “nanowire networks”, and/or “two-dimensional nanowires”. Nanowebs contain wire densities on the order of 10/cm. A possible mechanism for the fast self-assembly of crystalline metal oxide nanowires involves multiple nucleation and coalescence via oxidation-reduction reactions at the molecular level. The preferential growth of nanowires parallel to the substrate enables them to coalesce into regular polygonal networks. The individual segments of the polygonal network consist of both nanowires and nanotubules of β-gallium oxide. The synthesis of highly crystalline noncatalytic low melting metals such as β-gallium oxide tubes, nanowires, and nanopaintbrushes is accomplished using molten gallium and microwave plasma containing a mixture of monoatomic oxygen and hydrogen. Gallium oxide nanowires were 20-100 nm thick and tens to hundreds of microns long. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the nanowires to be highly crystalline and devoid of any structural defects. Results showed that multiple nucleation and growth of gallium oxide nanostructures can occur directly out of molten gallium exposed to appropriate composition of hydrogen and oxygen in the gas phase. The method of producing nanowebs is extendible to other low melting metals and their oxides such as for example: zinc oxide, tin oxide, aluminum oxide, bismuth oxide, and titanium dioxide.

The basis for the hierarchy of subshapes can be specified by the designer or based on the default parameter relations that come from architectural and engineering knowledge. The levels of the hierarchy are defined so that the most constrained lines of a shape are those lines that the designer intended exactly. These most constrained lines have specified parametric relations to other line segments and those relations, if altered, will compromise the designer's intentions. Conversely, the lowest level of the hierarchy, which contains the least constrained line segments, only implies a specific connectivity between line segments, necessitating a vaster search. The parametric recognition of curved line shapes uses a two-step approach that first performs shape matching with an equivalent straight-line shape then checks those transformations for matching with the actual curved lines. This approach has advantages over just matching characteristic polygons in that it can match equivalent curves with differing characteristic polygons as well as emergent shapes.

Two laser-based imaging techniques based on particle image velocimetry (PIV) and optical patternation are provided to map and contrast the size and velocity distributions for indirect and direct pneumatic nebulizations in plasma spectrometry. The flow field of droplets is illuminated by two pulses from a thin laser sheet with a known time difference. The scattering of the laser light from droplets is captured by a charge coupled device (CCD), providing two instantaneous images of the particles. Pointwise cross-correlation of the corresponding images yields a two-dimensional (2-D) velocity map of the aerosol velocity field. For droplet size distribution studies, the solution is doped with a fluorescent dye and both laser induced florescence (LIF) and Mie scattering images are captured simultaneously by two CCDs with the same field of view. The ratio of the LIF/Mie images provides relative droplet size information, which is then scaled by a point calibration method via a phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA). Two major outcomes are realized for three nebulization systems: 1) a direct injection high efficiency nebulizer (DIHEN); 2) a large-bore DIHEN (LB-DIHEN); and 3) a PFA microflow nebulizer with a PFA Scott-type spray chamber. First, the central region of the aerosol cone from the direct injection nebulizers and the nebulizer-spray chamber arrangement comprise fast (&gt;13 m/s and &gt;8 m/s, respectively) and fine (&lt;10 μm and &lt;5 μm, respectively) droplets as compared to slow (&lt;4 m/s) and large (&gt;25 μm) droplets in the fringes. Second, the spray chamber acts as a momentum separator, rather than a droplet size selector, as it removes droplets having larger sizes or velocities.

The encoder linearly encodes a data stream to produce an encoded data stream. The modulator to produce an output waveform in accordance with the encoded data stream for transmission through a wireless channel. The modulator generates the output waveform as a multicarrier waveform having a set of subcarriers, e.g., an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. The encoder linearly encodes the data stream so that the subcarriers carry different linear combinations of information symbols of the data stream.

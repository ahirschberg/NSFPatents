12357330,20090723,20090183555,INTERCONNECT FOR MEMS DEVICE INCLUDING A VISCOELASTIC SEPTUM,"Provided is a micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) device for use with an elongate structure. The MEMS device includes a generally planar substrate, a device wall layer formed upon the substrate, a septum cavity formed in the device wall layer, a channel formed in the device wall layer in fluid communication with the septum cavity, and a septum element disposed in the septum cavity. The septum element is formed of a viscoelastic material. The septum element defines a septum entry surface and a septum exit surface with the septum exit surface being exposed to the channel and disposed between the septum entry surface and the channel. The septum element is without any openings formed through the septum element extending between the septum entry and exit surfaces. Methods of manufacturing and interacting with the MEMS device are also provided.",[Ellis Meng][Ronalee Lo],"","This application is related to and claims the benefit of the earlier filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/011,462, entitled INTERCONNECT FOR MEMS DEVICE INCLUDING A VISCOELASTIC SEPTUM, filed on Jan. 17, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This hybrid PLL simultaneously achieves the fast-locking advantage of the fractional-N PLL and design simplicity of the integer-N PLL. The frequency division mode switching facilitates a digital protocol to execute bandwidth switching, which increases the degree of design freedom for the bandwidth switching.",[Kyoungho Woo][Ham Donhee],[President and Fellows of Harvard College],"This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

The magnet is coupled with the optical coherence tomography device so that changes in the magnetic field are coordinated with collection of data by the optical coherence tomography device. This device may be used to examine a sample by spectral-domain magnetomotive optical coherence tomography, which includes examining the sample with a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography device, to collect optical coherence tomography data. The sample contains magnetic particles, and the magnetic particles are subjected to a changing magnetic field during the examining.",[Amy L. Oldenburg][Stephen A.

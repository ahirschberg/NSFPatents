11552444,20070809,20070183528,"Space-Time Codes for Linearly Labelled PAM, PSK, QAM and Related Constellations Using Gray Mapping","General algebraic space-time code constructions are presented for Gray-mapped 2-PSK, 2-PAM, and 4-QAM constellations. The space-time codes achieve the rate-diversity tradeoffâ€”i.e., they allow the transmission of information at the maximum rate possible for the given signaling constellation and the achieved transmit diversity level. New codes created by applying a nonsingular linear or affine transformation to the constellation labels retain the optimality of the original codes with respect to the rate-diversity tradeoff. Extensions to p-PSK, p-PAM, p-QAM, and related constellations, for p prime, are also given.

Projection optics formed entirely of mirrors are used to receive the light emitted from the object array and image the pattern of the array onto the active surface of the substrate. The mirrors in the projection optics include a first, concave mirror, a second, convex mirror, a third, concave mirror, and a fourth, convex mirror, each receiving the beam of light in turn, with the light reflected from the fourth mirror being imaged onto the active surface of the substrate with an image area greater than that of the original light emitting array.

During operation, the system allows a process to speculatively execute a critical section of code within a program without first acquiring a lock associated with the critical section. If the process subsequently completes the critical section without encountering an interfering data access from another process, the system commits changes made during the speculative execution, and resumes normal non-speculative execution of the program past the critical section. Otherwise, if an interfering data access from another process is encountered during execution of the critical section, the system discards changes made during the speculative execution, and attempts to re-execute the critical section.

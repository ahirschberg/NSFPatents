13701793,20130321,20130067909,CURVED MULTIMORPH MICROACTUATORS THAT BEND AND/OR TWIST,"A curved multimorph actuator is provided composed of a plurality of materials, each material exhibiting different deformations in response to a stimulus, such as heat. Application of different stimuli causes the actuator to bend and/or twist. In an embodiment, the actuator is capable of rotating an object about its center without significantly shifting the center in one or more dimensions. In a further embodiment, the actuator can be used to rotate an object about a first axis and a second axis, wherein the first axis and the second axis are mutually perpendicular. In an embodiment, rotation about the first axis and the second axis are achieved in combination. In another embodiment, rotation about the first axis is produced in response to a first stimulus and rotation about the second axis is produced in response to a second stimulus.",[Sagnik Pal][Huikai Xie][Karl R.

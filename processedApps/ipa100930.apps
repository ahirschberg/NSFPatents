12762708,20100930,20100249757,Method of Electrogenically Controlling Pump Molecules,"Activation of electrogenic pump molecules can be realized by a dynamic entrainment procedure which includes two steps: synchronization of individual pump molecules to work at the same pumping pace, and gradual modulation of the synchronization frequency. Na/K pump molecules were used as an example in a physiological operating mode by applying the concept of an electronic synchrotron to the biological system. It was shown that individual Na/K pump molecules can be synchronized by a well designed oscillating electric field. The synchronized pump currents show separated inward and outward pump currents and a magnitude ratio of 3:2 reflecting stoichiometric number of the pump molecules.",[Wei Chen],[UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA],"This application is continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser.

A value of a store instruction to be stored in a memory address, where the store instruction is executed by the functional model, is received by the timing model. This value is stored by the timing model in a target oracle memory at a time when the target system would execute the store instruction. The timing model compares the value in the target oracle memory with the value of a load instruction to be loaded from the same memory address, which is received from the functional model, at a time when the target system would execute the load instruction. The timing model detects an out-of-order instruction stream with respect to the target instruction stream if there is a miscomparison.",[Derek Chiou][Hari Angepat][Nikhil Patil],[Board of Regents The University of Texas System],"This application is related to the following commonly owned co-pending U.S. patent application:Provisional Application Ser.

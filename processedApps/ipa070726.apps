11233653,20070726,20070170952,QUASI-PARTICLE INTERFEROMETRY FOR LOGICAL GATES,"A quantum computer can only function stably if it can execute gates with extreme accuracy. “Topological protection” is a road to such accuracies. Quasi-particle interferometry is a tool for constructing topologically protected gates. Assuming the corrections of the Moore-Read Model for v=5/2's FQHE (Nucl. Phys. B 360, 362 (1991)) we show how to manipulate the collective state of two e/4-charge anti-dots in order to switch said collective state from one carrying trivial SU(2) charge, |1&gt;, to one carrying a fermionic SU(2) charge |ε&gt;. This is a NOT gate on the {|1&gt;, |ε&gt;} qubit and is effected by braiding of an electrically charged quasi particle σ which carries an additional SU(2)-charge. Read-out is accomplished by σ-particle interferometry.

11608683,20070726,20070171422,Two-Dimensional Spectral Shearing Interferometry for Ultrafast Pulse Characterization,"The phase spectrum of an ultrashort pulse is measured based on two-dimensional spectral shearing interferometry with zero delay. The measurement is performed utilizing an optical source pulse from which is extracted a short pulse and from which a chirped component is generated. The chirped component is split into first and second chirped pulses. The first and second pulses are then mixed with the short pulse in a nonlinear medium to produce up-converted and spectrally sheared copies of the first and second chirped pulses, which are measured in a spectrometer. A plurality of path lengths for the first second chirped pulses is provide to generate delays and shift the relative positions of the first and second chirped pulses for additional measurements. The apparatus and methods are uniquely suited for characterizing single-cycle pulses.

The system employs a tool able to identify spyware that is piggy-backed on executable files (such as software downloads) and is able to detect “drive-by download” attacks that install software on the victim's computer when a page is rendered by a browser program. The tool uses a virtual machine (VM) to sandbox and analyze potentially malicious content. By installing and running executable files within a clean VM environment, commercial anti-spyware tools can be employed to determine whether a specific executable contains piggy-backed spyware. By visiting a Web page with an unmodified browser inside a clean VM environment, predefined “triggers,” such as the installation of a new library, or the creation of a new process, can be used to determine whether the page mounts a drive-by download attack.

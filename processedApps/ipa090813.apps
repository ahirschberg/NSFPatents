Methods of the present invention utilize principles of ‘soft adhesion’ to guide the transfer, assembly and/or integration of features, such as printable semiconductor elements or other components of electronic devices. Methods of the present invention are useful for transferring features from a donor substrate to the transfer surface of an elastomeric transfer device and, optionally, from the transfer surface of an elastomeric transfer device to the receiving surface of a receiving substrate. The present methods and systems provide highly efficient, registered transfer of features and arrays of features, such as printable semiconductor element, in a concerted manner that maintains the relative spatial orientations of transferred features.",[Ralph G.

Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TRT) is the first bona fide common tumor antigen. While several 9mer peptides of the human TRT (hTRT) have been identified for HLA-A2, the most prevalent (˜50%) HLA type in humans, little information exists on peptides for the remaining HLA types. As described herein, a multi-step approach was taken to select and characterize a panel of HLA-B79mer peptides as candidate immunogens. Specifically, several of algorithm based predictions, in vivo immunization of HLA-B7 transgenic mice, in vitro immunization of human blood lymphocytes, in vivo processing and supertype binding were employed to identify HLA-B7-restricted epitopes in hTRT. A correlation between in vivo immunogenicity and actual HLA-B7 binding avidity was found for the seven predicted peptides. Furthermore, endogenous processing was found to correlate with in vitro immunogenicity in human PBMC and HLA-B7 supertype binding.",[Maurizio Zanetti][Xochitl Cortez-Gonzalez],[THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA],"",20070119,"The invention was made in part with government support from the National Institutes of Health Grant Nos.

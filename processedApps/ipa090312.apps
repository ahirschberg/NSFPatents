The method is based on low-complexity post-FFT signal processing. Minimum mean square error combining of signals is performed for signals received at spatially-distributed receiver elements using adaptive channel estimation and phase tracking. Doppler shifts are modeled as a consequence of motion-induced time compression and dilation. The Doppler rate is assumed constant over one OFDM block but can vary between OFDM blocks. Thus a non-constant Doppler shift is accommodated by the method. Non-uniform Doppler compensation across subchannels is based on adaptive estimation and prediction of the Doppler rate. A single adaptively estimated parameter is used to track the phases of all the carriers and channel estimates are updated on a block by block basis.",[Milica Stojanovic],[MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY],"",20070911,"This invention was produced utilizing U.S. Government support under Grant Number OCE-0532223, awarded by the National Science Foundation and under Grant Number N00014-05-G0106, awarded by the U.S. Navy.

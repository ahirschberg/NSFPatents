Some embodiments include a method of generating a virtual reference device (or chip). This approach uses a statistics to find devices in a sample set that are most similar and then averages their time domain signals to generate the virtual reference. Signals associated with the virtual reference can then be correlated with time domain signals obtained from the packages under inspection to obtain a quality signature. Defective and non-defective devices are separated by estimating a beta distribution that fits a quality signature histogram of inspected packages and determining a cutoff threshold for an acceptable quality signature. Other aspects, features, and embodiments are also claimed and described.","",[Georgia Tech Research Corporation],"This patent application is in some aspects related to PCT Patent Application Number PCT/US2010/22103, filed on 26 Jan. 2010, and entitled &#x201C;High-Speed Autofocus Interferometric Inspection Systems and Methods,&#x201D; which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth below.

A microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device has a channel made from the composite, where the channel forms a primary conduction path for the device. Upon applied voltage, capacitive actuators squeeze the composite, causing it to become conductive. The squishable device includes a control electrode, and a composite electrically and mechanically connected to two terminal electrodes. By applying a voltage to the control electrode relative to a first terminal electrode, an electric field is developed between the control electrode and the first terminal electrode. This electric field results in an attractive force between the control electrode and the first terminal electrode, which compresses the composite and enables electric control of the electron conduction from the first terminal electrode through the channel to the second terminal electrode.","",[MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/410,611, filed on Nov. 5, 2010, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.",20111107,This invention was made with government support under Grant #ECCS-0939514 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

In one aspect of the invention, the seed layer can be formed by applying nanoparticles onto a surface of the substrate; and the metallization is achieved by electroplating an electrically conducting metal onto the seed layer, whereby the nanoparticles serve as nucleation sites for metal deposition. In another approach, the seed layer can be formed by a self-assembling linker material, such as a sulfur-containing silane material.","","[Massachusetts Institute of Technology][GMZ Energy, Inc.][The Trustees of Boston College]","",20110224,"This invention was made with U.S. government support under Grant No. DE-FG02-08ER46516, awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Grant No. CMMI-0833084, awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

The LED includes a polarization field management template that has a three-dimensional patterned surface. The surface may be patterned with an array of hemispherical cavities, which may be formed by growing the template around a temporary template layer of spherical or other crystals. The method involves growing a quantum well layer on the patterned surface. The topographical variations in the patterned surface of the template cause corresponding topographical variations in the quantum well layer. These variations in spatial orientation of portions of the quantum well layer cause the polarization field of the quantum well layer to vary across the surface of the LED, which leads to energy transition shifting that provides “white” light emission across a broad wavelength spectrum.","",[Lehigh University],"This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/420,859, filed Dec. 8, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.",20111208,"This invention was made with government support under U.S. National Science Foundation&#x2014;ECCS Award #0701421, and U.S. National Science Foundation&#x2014;CBET Award #0828426.

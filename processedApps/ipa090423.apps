11795612,20090423,20090101559,Microconcentrator/Microfilter,"The present invention includes a microfluidic filter and concentrator that can separate a filtrate from a fluid containing components, e.g. a suspension of particles, to be removed from the fluid at least to some extent. The filter may employ principals of tangential flow filtration, also known as cross-flow filtration. In one aspect, a microfluidic filter described herein includes at least a first, main channel and one or more secondary, filtering channels that connect to the main channel. Filtration occurs when a fluid portion of a sample that is flowed through the main channel enters one or more of the filtering channels and at least some of the components in the sample do not enter or do not flow through the secondary, filtering channels. The secondary channels may be dimensioned to inhibit flow of components through them, and/or a porous material such as a layer may be positioned to inhibit flow of components through the secondary channels.",[Anand Bala Subramaniam][Manouk Abkarian][Adrien Fabre][Marc Durand][Howard A.

12025626,20090423,20090104386,ORIENTED NANOFIBERS EMBEDDED IN A POLYMER MATRIX,"A method of forming a composite of embedded nanofibers in a polymer matrix is disclosed. The method includes incorporating nanofibers in a plastic matrix forming agglomerates, and uniformly distributing the nanofibers by exposing the agglomerates to hydrodynamic stresses. The hydrodynamic said stresses force the agglomerates to break apart. In combination or additionally elongational flow is used to achieve small diameters and alignment. A nanofiber reinforced polymer composite system is disclosed. The system includes a plurality of nanofibers that are embedded in polymer matrices in micron size fibers. A method for producing nanotube continuous fibers is disclosed. Nanofibers are fibrils with diameters 100 nm, multiwall nanotubes, single wall nanotubes and their various functionalized and derivatized forms. The method includes mixing a nanofiber in a polymer; and inducing an orientation of the nanofibers that enables the nanofibers to be used to enhance mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. Orientation is induced by high shear mixing and elongational flow, singly or in combination. The polymer may be removed from said nanofibers, leaving micron size fibers of aligned nanofibers.",[Enrique V. Barrera][Fernando J.

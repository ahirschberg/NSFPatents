The increased responsivity of the photodetector may be a result of effectively ‘guiding’ photons into the active area of the device in the form of a surface plasmon polariton. In one embodiment, the plasmonic lens may not substantially decrease the speed of the MSM photodetector. In another embodiment, the Shottkey contacts of the MSM photodetector may be corrugated to provide integrated plasmonic lens. For example, one or more of the cathodes and anodes can be modified to create a plurality of corrugations. These corrugations may be configured as a plasmonic lens on the surface of a photodetector. The corrugations may be configured as parallel linear corrugations, equally spaced curved corrugations, curved parallel corrugations, approximately equally spaced concentric circular corrugations, chirped corrugations or the like.",[Bahram Nabet][James Anthony Shackleford][Richard R.

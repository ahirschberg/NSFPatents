11522665,20070419,20070084993,TRANSVERSE OPTICAL ACCELERATOR AND GENERALIZED OPTICAL VORTICES,"A method and system for generating modulated optical vortices. Optical vortices can be used for a variety of applications, such as applying controlled torque or controlled force patterns to objects from a few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers in size. Numerous optical modes of optical vortices can be created to meet virtually any desired need in manipulating of objects. Furthermore, one can modify the wavefront of a beam of light in a specific way to create a new type of optical trap useful for manipulating mesoscopic materials. When the modified beam is brought to a focus, the resulting optical trap exerts forces transverse to the optical axis that can be used to transport mesoscopic matter such as nanoclusters, colloidal particles, and biological cells.

11480557,20070419,20070087172,Phase separation in patterned structures,"Novel phase-separation behavior by a mixture, including binary mixture, of patterning compounds, including alkanethiols, when deposited onto a surface, including a gold surface, using micro and nano-deposition tools such as tip and stamp methods like micro-contact printing (μCP), and Dip-Pen Nanolithography (DPN). This behavior is significantly different than that observed in the bulk. This behavior was demonstrated using three examples of compounds: 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA), 1-octadecanethiol (ODT), and CF(CF)(CH)SH (PFT). The identity of the resulting segregated structure was confirmed by lateral force microscopy (LFM), and by selective metal-organic coordination chemistry. This phenomenon is exploited to print sub-100 nm wide alkanethiol features via conventional μCP and to form sub-15 nm features using DPN printing, which is below the ultimate resolution of both these techniques. These nano-patterned materials also can serve as templates for constructing more complex architectures.

Free radical initiated peptide sequencing, or FRIPS, consists of covalently attaching a free radical initiator to a peptide and collisionally activating this conjugate. This results in fragment formation. Subsequent collision-activated dissociation further dissociates the fragments, producing a group of ions based on the interaction of the free radical initiator and the target molecule. The methodology is applied to the fundamental study of biologically relevant reactions of free radicals with peptides and proteins in the gas phase, as well as to a completely gas-phase approach to protein sequencing.

A vapor phase method in which nucleation and growth of metal oxides at temperatures higher than the oxide decomposition temperatures lead to the respective metal nanowires. The chemical vapor transport of tungsten in the presence of oxygen onto substrates kept at temperatures higher than the tungsten oxide decomposition temperature (˜1450° C.) led to nucleation and growth of pure metallic tungsten nanowires. In a similar procedure, tungsten oxide nanowires were synthesized by maintaining the substrates at a temperature lower than the decomposition temperature of tungsten oxide. The vapor transport of low-melting metal oxides provides a procedure for synthesizing metal and metal oxide nanowires.

Molecular/genetic analysis using site-directed and deletion mutants revealed that loss of calmodulin binding abolished the function of DWF1 in planta, whereas partial loss of calmodulin binding resulted in a partial dwarf phenotype in complementation studies, providing direct proof that Ca/calmodulin-mediated signalling has a critical role in controlling the DWF1 function. Furthermore, DWF1 orthologues from other plants have a similar Ca/calmodulin-binding domain, indicating that Ca/calmodulin regulation of DWF1 and its homologues is common, and broadly applicable in plants. Methods for generating size-engineered crops are provided by altering the Ca/calmodulin-binding property of their DWF1 orthologues. Likewise, according to additional aspects, DWF4, DWF5 and CPD were also shown to be Ca/calmodulin-binding proteins, and can likewise be used for generating size-engineered crops by altering the Ca/calmodulin-binding property of their orthologues in a variety of plants, including crop plants.

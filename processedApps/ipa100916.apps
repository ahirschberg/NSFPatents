The fluidically integrated jet transports ambient gas or liquid into the jet/sensor assembly through integrated gas or liquid channels, impinges the sample gas or liquid on the sensing element, and finally ejects the sample gas or liquid back into the ambient gas or liquid. The response of the sensor in the presence of the active jet is compared to its response when the jet is inactive. The jet actuator directs entrained ambient gas or liquid toward the active surface of the sensor, and the impingement of sample gas or liquid onto the surface of the sensor results in faster response time.

Methods are, thus, disclosed that provide the ability to control the desired properties of the composites.

In an exemplary embodiment, the composites are formed by selecting matrix particles and filler particles wherein the ratio of the average size of the matrix particles to the average size of the filler particles is about 10 or more. The selected matrix particles exhibit a glass transition temperature. The matrix particles and the filler particles are mechanically mixed and then subjected to a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the matrix particles and a compression pressure for a period of time sufficient to cause the matrix particles to undergo deformation so as to compress them together eliminating void spaces between the particles without melting the matrix material.

The artificial neural network can generate an output that is influenced by the input data of both events. In various embodiments, the new trainable nodes are sequentially produced and show decreasing trainability over time such that, at a particular point in time, newer produced nodes are more trainable than earlier produced nodes. The artificial neural network can be included in various embodiments of methods, apparatus and articles for use in predicting or profiling events.",[Fred H.

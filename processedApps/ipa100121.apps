When multi-mode, this invention effectively transfers energy back and forth between the dielectric waveguide and metal surface. This improves on standard SPP modes, yielding longer range propagation along with high intensity near the metal surface at decisive locations. When single-mode, this hybrid waveguide allows for control of propagation and confinement for applications such as telecommunications optics integrated on silicon microchips. Gratings may be patterned in the metal for coupling light into and out of the modes or for use as mirrors in the mode. For areas where very long ranges are required, a metal grating may be used to couple light into the mode, but then the metal may be removed in other regions and make the range of the mode virtually infinite (limited by surface roughness).",[P.

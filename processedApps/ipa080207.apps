These fluidic devices are analogous to electronic integrated circuits fabricated using large scale integration (LSI). A component of these networks is the fluidic multiplexor, which is a combinatorial array of binary valve patterns that exponentially increases the processing power of a network by allowing complex fluid manipulations with a minimal number of inputs. These integrated microfluidic networks can be used to construct a variety of highly complex microfluidic devices, for example the microfluidic analog of a comparator array, and a microfluidic memory storage device resembling electronic random access memories.",[Sebastian J.

In a method of the invention, a transmission lines are patterned as to connect a clock tree and a periodic waveform clock, preferably a sine waveform, is used to control clock skew, even at frequencies extending into the gigahertz range. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, an overlay includes differential pairs of transmission lines that connect the drivers of a clock distribution tree. In preferred embodiments of the invention, an H-tree clock distribution scheme is overlayed with a spiral of transmission lines, each realized by a differential conductors and driven using a sinusoidal standing wave to distribute global clock signals into local regions of the chip. Each transmission line connects drivers in the H-tree that are at the same level of the H-tree. In a VLSI chip according to an embodiment of the invention, the transmission line overlay delivers sinusoidal clock signals to local areas that are locally converted into digital clock signals. The invention thus presents a passive technique for clock distribution. ",[Chung-Kuan Cheng][Hongyu Chen],""," This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119 from prior application Ser.

The system has multiple cameras distributed around a viewing volume. The cameras allow for the creation of three-dimensional mesh representations of an object dynamically moving within the viewing volume. A model of the object that incorporates specific morphological and kinematic model information (including soft joint constraints) is then matched to the captured three-dimensional mesh representations. The matching routine aims to embed the model into each of the three-dimensional representations using (i) iterative closest point or simulated annealing algorithms and (ii) using soft joint constraints. This unique combination of routines offers a simple, time-efficient, accurate and thus more meaningful assessment of movements. The system further offers feasibility of accurately and precisely measuring three-dimensional kinematics of the dynamically moving object or human.

The method involves obtaining a microscopic image of the unstained tissue that reveals cell boundaries, such as a differential interference contrast (DIC) image, and an optical quadrature microscopy (OQM) image which is used to prepare an image of optical path length deviation (OPD) across the cell cluster. The boundaries of individual cells in the cell cluster are modeled as ellipses and used, together with the maximum optical path length deviation of a cell, to calculate ellipsoidal model cells that are subtracted from the OPD image. The process is repeated until the OPD image is depleted of phase signal attributable to cells of the cell cluster, and the cell count is obtained from the number of cells subtracted. The method is capable of accurately and non-invasively counting the number of cells in a living embryo at the 2-30 cell stage, and can be employed to assess the developmental stage and health of human embryos for fertility treatments.

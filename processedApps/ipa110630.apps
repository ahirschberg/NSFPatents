An optical sensor is positioned on a person's hand, e.g., on the person's finger or fingers, or on the person's palm, or is positioned on a stylus used by the person. The optical sensor is traced over an image. When the sensor passes over or follows a location of color or an edge or point of contrast of the graphical information or image, e.g., a line graph, bar graph or pie chart, tactile feedback is provided to the user. The combination of the mechanical stimulation in the same area of the hand used in the sensing (i.e., being kinesthetic ally concordant) will allow the user to more easily and quickly ‘sense’ the shape or image presented on the display or paper.",[David Burch][Dianne Pawluk],"","",20081219,"This invention was made with support in part from a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF HS grant 0712936), and the U.S. Government may have certain rights in the invention.","","",20110310,PCT/US08/87605

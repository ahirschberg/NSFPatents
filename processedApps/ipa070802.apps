11653056,20070802,20070177735,Quantum secret splitting based on non-orthogonal multi-particle states,"Systems and methods for quantum secret splitting based on non-orthogonal multi-particle states are disclosed. The method includes preparing at a sender (“Charlie”) two qubits each of which can be in one of two non-orthogonal states and distributing the qubits to respective parties Alice and Bob. The method also includes measuring at Alice the state of the qubit she receives by a projective measurement so that the measurement result is either 0 or 1, and at Bob measuring the state of the qubit he receives such that the measurement result is either 0, 1 or ƒ, wherein ƒ represents a failure by Bob to properly measure the qubit state. The method also includes communicating between Alice, Bob and Charlie the outcome of their respective measurements so as to deduce the state of the qubits sent to Alice and Bob.

According to an example embodiment of the present invention, a digital imaging arrangement implements microlenses to direct light to photosensors that detect the light and generate data corresponding to the detected light. The generated data is used to compute an output image, where each output image pixel value corresponds to a selective weighting and summation of a subset of the detected photosensor values. The weighting is a function of characteristics of the imaging arrangement. In some applications, the weighting reduces the contribution of data from photosensors that contribute higher amounts of optical aberration to the corresponding output image pixel.","",[THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY],"This patent application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

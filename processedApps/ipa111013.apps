During genome packaging in bacteriophages, a powerful molecular motor assembles at the special portal vertex of an empty prohead to initiate packaging. An aspect of the invention relates to the phage T4 packaging machine being highly promiscuous, translocating DNA into finished phage heads as well as into proheads. Single motors can force exogenous DNA into phage heads at the same rate as into proheads and phage heads undergo repeated initiations, packaging multiple DNA molecules into the same head. This shows that the phage DNA packaging machine has unusual conformational plasticity, powering DNA into an apparently passive capsid receptacle, including the highly stable virus shell, until it is full. These features allow for the design of a novel class of nanocapsid delivery vehicles.",[Venigalla B.

Method using complementary character coding, a new approach to character level dynamic tainting, which allows efficient and precise taint propagation across the boundaries of server components, and also between servers and clients over HTTP. In this approach, each character has two encodings, which can be used to distinguish trusted and untrusted data. Small modifications to the lexical analyzers in components such as the application code interpreter, the database management system, and (optionally) the web browser allow them to become complement aware components, capable of using this alternative character coding scheme to enforce security policies aimed at preventing injection attacks, while continuing to function normally in other respects. This approach overcomes some weaknesses of previous dynamic tainting approaches by offering a precise protection against persistent cross-site scripting attacks, as taint information is maintained when data is passed to a database and later retrieved by the application program.

One obstacle to materializing this prospect arises from high viscosity of ILs significantly slowing down sol-gel reactions. A method was developed which provides phosphonium-based, pyridinium-based, and imidazolium-based IL-mediated advanced sol-gel organic-inorganic hybrid materials for capillary microextraction. Scanning electron microscopy results demonstrate that ILs can serve as porogenic agents in sol-gel reactions. IL-mediated sol-gel coatings prepared with silanol-terminated polymers provided up to 28 times higher extractions compared to analogous sol-gel coatings prepared without any IL in the sol solution. This study shows that IL-generated porous morphology alone is not enough to provide effective extraction media: careful choice of the organic polymer and the precursor with close sol-gel reactivity must be made to ensure effective chemical bonding of the organic polymer to the created sol-gel material to be able to provide the desired sorbent characteristics.","",[UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA],"This application is a continuation of prior filed International Application, Serial Number PCT US2010 035797 filed May 21, 2010, which claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/180,274 filed May 21, 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference into this disclosure.",20111121,This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DGE-0221681 awarded by the National Science Foundation and Grant No. DE-AC05-000R22750 awarded by the Department of Homeland Security.

As such, the plasmon-resonating nanoparticles direct light to the band gap of the semiconductor at an increased intensity (relative to when such nanoparticles are not present). And because of that increased intensity, the photoactive composition can be more efficiently used to catalyze a photochemical reaction or generate electrical potential in a photovoltaic cell.",[Suljo Linic][Phillip N.

In an aspect, the printing is by conformal contact between an elastomeric stamp inked with the semiconductor elements and a receiving surface, and during stamp removal, a shear offset is applied between the stamp and the receiving surface. The shear-offset printing process achieves high printing transfer yields with good placement accuracy. Process parameter selection during transfer printing, including time varying stamp-backing pressure application and vertical displacement, yields substantially constant delamination rates with attendant transfer printing improvement.",[Etienne MENARD],"","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/116,136 filed Nov. 19, 2008, which is specifically incorporated by reference to the extent not inconsistent herewith.",20091119,"This invention was made, at least in part, with United States governmental support awarded by National Science Foundation Grant IIP-0712017.

Digital PCR is then be used to detect aneuploidy, such as the trisomy that causes Down Syndrome. Since aneuploidies do not present a mutational change in sequence, and are merely a change in the number of chromosomes, it has not been possible to detect them in a fetus without resorting to invasive techniques such as amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling.

12492830,20100520,20100124759,MICROFLUIDIC DROPLETS FOR METABOLIC ENGINEERING AND OTHER APPLICATIONS,"The present invention relates generally to the use of droplets to culture and/or assay cells or other species. In some cases, the cells or other species may be sorted based upon the results of the culture and/or assay. In some embodiments, cells other species can be encapsulated in droplets and exposed to one or more agents (e.g., a sugar, an indicator dye, etc.). For instance, in some cases, exposure of cells to the agents may result in the production of metabolites or other compounds (e.g., amino acids, proteins, organic acids, etc.) which may be, for example, assayed or otherwise determined. In some embodiments, the reaction of an agent with cells and/or other species within a droplet may reveal a property of the cells or other species (e.g., sugar consumption, growth rate, ability to withstand exposure to the agent, etc.). As an example, cells that produce desired metabolites or exhibit certain properties may be separated from the other cells via sorting techniques. Other aspects of the invention relate to devices or kits for implementing such sorts, methods of promoting such techniques, or the like.",[Benjamin L. Wang][Katherine J. Humphry][David A.

12334471,20100520,20100125594,Method and Apparatus for Improving Performance of Approximate String Queries Using Variable Length High-Quality Grams,"A computer process, called VGRAM, improves the performance of these string search algorithms in computers by using a carefully chosen dictionary of variable-length grams based on their frequencies in the string collection. A dynamic programming algorithm for computing a tight lower bound on the number of common grams shared by two similar strings in order to improve query performance is disclosed. A method for automatically computing a dictionary of high-quality grams for a workload of queries. Improvement on query performance is achieved by these techniques by a cost-based quantitative approach to deciding good grams for approximate string queries. An approach for answering approximate queries efficiently based on discarding gram lists, and another is based on combining correlated lists. An indexing structure is reduced to a given amount of space, while retaining efficient query processing by using algorithms in a computer based on discarding gram lists and combining correlated lists.",[Chen Li][Bin Wang][Xaochun Yang][Alexander Behm][Shengyue Ji][Jiaheng Lu],[The Regents of the University of California],"The present application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

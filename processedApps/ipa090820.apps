12372185,20090820,20090206054,MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR CREATING IMAGING LAYERS,"The present invention provides patterned features of dimensions of less than 50 nm on a substrate. According to various embodiments, the features may be “Manhattan” style structures, have high aspect ratios, and/or have atomically smooth surfaces. The patterned features are made from polymer brushes grafted to a substrate. In some embodiments, the dimensions of the features may be determined by adjusting the grafting density and/or the molecular weight of the brushes. Once the brushes are patterned, the features can be shaped and reshaped with thermal or solvent treatments to achieve the desired profiles. The chemical nature of the polymer brush is thus independent of the patterning process, which allows for optimization of the polymer brush used for specific applications. Applications include masks for pattern transfer techniques such as reactive ion etching.",[Paul F. Nealey][Tushar S. Jain][Erik W.

12342524,20090820,20090207651,METHOD FOR SWITCHING MAGNETIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY ELEMENTS AND MAGNETIC ELEMENT STRUCTURES,"A method for storing data in a magnetic memory element of an array of elements which avoids inadvertent switching of other elements is disclosed. First and second magnetic fields are applied to a selected magnetic element for a first time interval to switch the element into an intermediate state where minor domains are created. A second value of magnetic fields are then applied large enough to switch the magnetization of the minor domains, but not large enough to switch the magnetization of an adjacent memory cell. Once the minor domain is switched, the magnetization of the magnetic element assumes the state where the major domain has a magnetization direction representing the value of the stored data bit. Reducing the grain size of crystallites contained in a bit reduces the intrinsic anisotropy of the magnetic memory element thus improving bit selectivity.",[Siu-Tat Chui],[University of Delaware],"This Application is a continuation of co-pending U.S. application Ser.

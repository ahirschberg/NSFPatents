11556993,20070906,20070206008,Apparatus and Method for Real-Time Volume Processing and Universal Three-Dimensional Rendering,"An apparatus and method for real-time volume processing and universal three-dimensional rendering. The apparatus includes a plurality of three-dimensional (3D) memory units; at least one pixel bus for providing global horizontal communication; a plurality of rendering pipelines; at least one geometry bus; and a control unit. The apparatus includes a block processor having a circular ray integration pipeline for processing voxel data and ray data. Rays are generally processed in image order thus permitting great flexibility (e.g., perspective projection, global illumination). The block processor includes a splatting unit and a scattering unit. A method for casting shadows and performing global illumination in relation to light sources includes sweeping a two dimensional array of rays through the volume can also be implemented with the apparatus. A method for approximating a perspective projection includes using parallel projection.

A substrate having at its surface at least one photoelectrode that is proximate to at least one molecule bearing at least one chemical functional group is provided, along with a reagent-generating chemistry co-localized with the chemical functional group and capable of generating reagents when subjected to a potential above a threshold. An input potential is then applied to the photoelectrode that exceeds the threshold in the presence of light and that does not exceed the threshold in the absence of light, causing the transfer of electrons to or from the substrate, and creating a patterned substrate. The process is repeated until a polymer array of desired size is created.

The arrays have particular utility for the screening of peptides ligands that can foster the growth of cells in culture. This technique has been used to identify peptide ligands that foster the growth of human stem cells, which otherwise require an extracellular matrix in order to grow in an undifferentiated state. This also makes possible an assay to identify other such peptides.

11748088,20070906,20070207923,Flue Gas Purification Process Using A Sorbent Polymer Composite Material,"This invention provides a process of removing sulfur oxides, mercury vapor, and fine particulate matters from industrial flue gases that contain such pollutants. The pollutants are removed by modules, which contain microporous adsorbent (i.e., sorbent) material that is held within a polymer matrix. The preferred polymers are fluoropolymers. The composite material that contains the microporous absorbent material held within a polymer matrix removes sulfur oxides by converting them into high concentration sulfuric acids. It also removes mercury vapor by chemically adsorbing the mercury into the matrix. It also removes fine particulate matters by surface filtration. The sulfuric acid that is produced inside the composite material is automatically expelled onto the external surfaces of the composite material and is drained into an acid reservoir together with the fine particulate matters which are washed from the external surfaces of the composite material by the constant dripping of the sulfuric acid along the external surfaces of the composite material.

11558721,20070906,20070208975,PARALLEL ARCHITECTURE FOR LOW POWER LINEAR FEEDBACK SHIFT REGISTERS,"The present invention provides an apparatus and method for implementing low-power linear feedback shift registers (LFSR) that efficiently produce single or multiple outputs. In one case of single output generation the gates are permanently connected to the respective flip-flops reducing the number of switches necessary. In the case of multiple outputs the outputs are generated several clock cycles at once, which enables the frequency of operation to be reduced by a factor equal to the number of outputs produced at a time. In either case grouping is utilized for reducing the number of gates necessary and the power dissipation. The invention is applicable to a wide range of applications, including but not limited to data compression, encryption, communication, error correction, built-in self-test, and so forth.

11932745,20080515,20080112094,HIGH SPEED LOW POWER ANNULAR MAGNETIC DEVICES BASED ON CURRENT INDUCED SPIN-MOMENTUM TRANSFER,"A high speed and low power method to control and switch the magnetization direction and/or helicity of a magnetic region in a magnetic device for memory cells using spin polarized electrical current. The magnetic device comprises a reference magnetic layer with a fixed magnetic helicity and/or magnetization direction and a free magnetic layer with a changeable magnetic helicity. The fixed magnetic layer and the free magnetic layer are preferably separated by a non-magnetic layer, and the reference layer includes an easy axis perpendicular to the reference layer. A current can be applied to the device to induce a torque that alters the magnetic state of the device so that it can act as a magnetic memory for writing information. The resistance, which depends on the magnetic state of the device, is measured to thereby read out the information stored in the device.",[Andrew Kent][Barbaros Ozyilmaz][Enrique Gonzalez Garcia],[New York University],"This patent application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

New hydrides with direct Si—Ge bonds derived from the family of compounds (HGe)SiH(x=1-4) are used to grow uniform, relayed and highly planar films with low defect densities at unprecedented low temperatures between about 300-450° C., circumventing entirely the need of thick compositionally graded buffer layer and lift off technologies. At about 500-700° C., SiGequantum dots are grown with narrow size distribution, defect-free microstructures and highly homogeneous elemental content at the atomic level. The method provides precise control of morphology, composition, structure and strain via the incorporation of the entire Si/Ge framework of the gaseous precursor into the film. The grown materials possess the required morphological and microstructural characteristics for applications in high frequency electronic and optical systems, as well as templates and buffer layers for development of commercial devices based on high mobility Si and Ge channels.",[John Kouvetakis][Ignatius S.T.

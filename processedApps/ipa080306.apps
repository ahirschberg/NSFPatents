11513006,20080306,20080056255,Lateral error correction for time-critical multicast,"A system and method for providing a low-latency reliable multicast protocol designed for time-critical clustered applications. Internet Protocol (IP) multicast is used to transmit data and recovers from packet loss in end-hosts using a repair mechanism involving the exchange of XOR repairs between receivers and across groups. The system and method of the present invention can be embodied in a scalable, reliable and fast multicast primitive that can be layered under high-level abstractions such as publish-subscribe, group communication and replicated service/object infrastructures.",[Kenneth Paul Birman][Mahesh Balakrishnan],"[Cornell Research Foundation, Inc.]","",20060830,"This invention was made with United States Government support from DARPA, AFRL, AFOSR, NSF under contract numbers SRS-FA8750-04-2-0011, FA8750-05-2-0128, F49620-02-1-0233, and 0435190, respectively.

11845607,20080306,20080056517,DYNAMIC BINAURAL SOUND CAPTURE AND REPRODUCTION IN FOCUED OR FRONTAL APPLICATIONS,"A new approach to tracking head motion for headphone-based sound is described. Called MTB2.0 for “Motion-Tracked Binaural with 2 Channels”, the method may be used for any 2-channel binaural signals without any increase in the bandwidth requirement. MTB2.0 provides a simple and effective means to improve the quality of headphone-based sound reproduction by sensing the orientation of the listener's head and using the sensed orientation to appropriately modify the signals sent to the two ears. MTB2.0 method increases the realism and removes some of the shortcomings of binaural sound capture and recording, as well as improves the quality of binaural rendering of stereo. ",[V.

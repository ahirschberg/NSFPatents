The enhancement of fluorescence is achieved by the combination of high intensity near-fields and strong coherent scattering effects, attributed to leaky photonic crystal eigenmodes (resonance modes). The photonic crystal simultaneously exhibits resonance modes which overlap both the absorption and emission wavelengths of the fluorophore. A significant enhancement in fluorescence intensity from the fluorophores on the photonic crystal surface is demonstrated.",[Brain T. Cunningham][Nikhil Ganesh][Patrick C. Mathias][Ian D.

Light from a polychromatic light source is input to the monolithic interferometer where it undergoes interference based on the optical path difference (OPD) of the interferometer. The resulting wavelength-modulated output beam is analyzed by a reference spectrometer to generate reference data. The output beam from the interferometer can be provided to an arbitrary spectral instrument. Wavelength calibration of the arbitrary spectral instrument may then be performed based on a comparison of the spectral instrument output with the reference data. By appropriate choice of materials for the monolithic interferometer, a highly stable structure can be fabricated that has a wide field and/or is thermally compensated.

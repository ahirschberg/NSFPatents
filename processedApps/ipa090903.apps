Preferably, the added metals are substituted in a concentration between about 0.005 and 10%, have an oxidation state less than +6, and possess a similar ionic radius to W. The substituted metal oxides are preferably formed as nanoparticles and sintered into a dense structure or coating possessing a surface-depletion layer sensitive to the surface adsorption of gas molecules and whose resistance changes in a predictable manner with gas adsorption. The extent of resistance change, rate of change and rate of desorption can be different for different gases, depending on the gas molecule's polarizability, dipole moments and electron configuration. The sensor can be used in a wide range of temperatures and corrosive conditions because of the intrinsic stability of the substituted metal oxides.",[Robert C. McDonald][Katherine E.

Recent developments in mathematics and signal processing have uncovered a solution to this Nyquist/Shannon sampling rate bottlenck for signals that are sparse or compressible in some representation. We demonstrate and reduce to practice methods to extract information directly from an analog or digital signal based on altering our notion of sampling to replace uniform time samples with more general linear functionals.

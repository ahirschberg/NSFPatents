One or more antennas are operates in accordance with a Space-Time-State Block Code (STS-BC) to effectuate channel coding of a signal being transmitted wirelessly between communication devices. In accordance with such an STS-BC, one or more antennas (being reconfigurable in nature) of a communication device are reconfigured in different radiation states. From some perspectives, this may be viewed as performing three-dimensional channel coding, in that, in addition to achieving at least time diversity of signals being transmitted (and also potentially including spatial diversity), state diversity may be achieved by adapting one or more characteristics of one or more antennas within the communication device. Such an STS-BC may operate in an open loop configuration without requiring any feedback from another communication device to which signals are transmitted. If desired, feedback may be employed for adaptively modifying an STS-BC (or selecting another STS-BC).",[Fatemeh Fazel][Alfred Grau Besoli][Hamid Jafakhani][Franco De Flaviis],[The Regents of the University of California],"The present U.S. Utility Patent Application claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) to the following U.S. Provisional Patent Application which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and made part of the present U.S. Utility Patent Application for all purposes:1.

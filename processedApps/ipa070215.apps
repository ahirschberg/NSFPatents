11374485,20070215,20070036202,"Code, signal and conjugate direction design for rapidly-adaptive communication receivers and electromagnetic, acoustic and nuclear array processors","A system and method are disclosed that substantially reduce the complexity of receivers in digitally modulated wireless communication systems such as systems that use CDMA and similar multi-access coding. Transmitted signals are designed to use orthogonal or non-orthogonal codes with specific amplitudes that reduce the number of distinct eigenvalues in a code correlation matrix or in a code-plus-interference-plus-noise correlation matrix, so that a few steps of a conjugate direction calculation will compute a reduced rank Wiener filter that can be used to provide approximate de-correlation type receivers in a substantially reduced number of steps when compared to inverse correlation matrix calculations, or when compared to conjugate direction computations run on correlation matrices with un-shaped eigenvalues. These techniques can also be applied to active or passive imaging systems such as sonar, ultrasound and radar imaging systems and phased array systems that use beam forming. Cancellation of interference and noise can also be accomplished by exploiting eigenvalue shape or by designing the codes and amplitudes of the transmitted signal and using the reduced rank Wiener filter to filter interference and noise from the receive signal. The techniques enable the use of code design and power control for the control of system complexity and bandwidth.

In use the shape memory polymer serves to bring opposing surfaces in a structural defect into proximity, whereafter heating the molecular scale healing composition to a level at or above its melting point allows for molecular scale healing. The composition has the ability to close macroscopic defects, and to do so repeatedly even if another wound occurs in a previously healed area.","","","This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) from U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

One or more silicone elastomeric patches located outside the optical path on the anterior side but away from the equator can be accessed by surgical needles in order to fill or adjust optically clear fluid within the lens. The fluid can be adjusted in order to set a base dioptric power of the lens and otherwise adjust a lens after its initial insertion. The elastomeric patches are sized so that they self-seal after a needle is withdrawn. A straight or stepped slit in the patch can allow a blunt needle to more easily access the interior of the lens.","",[University of Southern California][California Institute of Technology],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/526,147, filed Aug. 22, 2011, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/488,964, filed May 23, 2011, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes.",20120113,This invention was made with government support under EEC0310723 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

13511317,20121129,20120304323,MATERNALLY INDUCED STERILITY IN ANIMALS,"The present invention provides Maternal Sterility Constructs (MSC) and methods of producing sterile progeny lacking germ cells. Female animals carrying the MSC transgene will give rise to a sterile generation, as the MSC specifically eliminates Progenitor Germ Cells (PGCs) of her progeny. These females are called lineage ending females. Male animals carrying the MSC transgene, however, give rise to fertile progeny (assuming the male is not derived from an MSC-transgenic female). Thus, MSC transgenic males can be used to propagate the transgenic line. The invention can be advantageously applied to eliminate pest or invasive species, or to provide effective population control and improve culture performance of farmed species, such as fish and shellfish.","","[AquaBounty Technologies, Inc.]","This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Appl.

The functionalized surface is exposed to at least one vapor stabilization species that reacts with the functionalization layer to form a stabilization layer that stabilizes the functionalization layer against desorption from the planar microelectronic surface while providing chemically functional groups. The stabilized surface is exposed to at least one material layer precursor species that deposits a material layer on the stabilized planar microelectronic surface. The stabilized planar microelectronic surface can be annealed at a peak annealing temperature that is less than about 700° C.","",[PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE],"This is a divisional of co-pending application Ser.

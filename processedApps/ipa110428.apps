12605178,20110428,20110094302,Micromachined Gyroscopes with 2-DOF Sense Modes Allowing Interchangeable Robust and Precision Operation,"A z-axis gyroscope design is presented with a 2-degree of freedom (DOF) sense mode allowing interchangeable operation in either precision (mode-matched) or robust (wide-bandwidth) modes. This is accomplished using a complete 2-DOF coupled system which allows for the specification of the sense mode resonant frequencies and coupling independent of frequency. By decoupling the frame connecting the sense system to a central anchor, x-y symmetry is preserved while enabling a fully coupled 2-DOF sense mode providing control over both the bandwidth and the amount of coupling independent of operational frequency. The robust mode corresponds to operation between the 2-DOF sense mode resonant frequencies providing a response gain and bandwidth controlled by frequency spacing. Precision mode of operation, however, relies on mode-matching the drive to the second, anti-phase sense mode resonant frequency which can be designed to provide a gain advantage over a similar 1-DOF system.",[Adam Schofield][Alexander Trusov][Andrei Shkel],[THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA],"",20091023,"This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. 0409923, awarded by the National Science Foundation.

12805579,20110428,20110095243,"Photochromic compounds based on ring opening and closing of an [1,3]oxazine compound","We have designed a molecular switch based on the photoinduced opening and thermal closing of a [1,3]oxazine ring. A substituted [1,3]oxazine compound described as having a general (i.e., unsubstituted) structure with fused indoline and benzooxazine fragments such that they share a common bond in the [1,3]oxazine compound: (i) the bond connecting positions 1 and 2 of the indoline fragment and (ii) the bond connecting positions 2 and 3 of the benzooxazine fragment. Irradiation by light of suitable wavelength and intensity of this photochromic compound induces cleavage of a [C—O] bond of the [1,3]oxazine ring to form a phenolate chromophore. The photogenerated (e.g., colored) isomer may revert thermally to the starting (e.g., colorless) oxazine. Alternatively, the switch may be between isomers of the compound that absorb at different wavelengths. Reversible coloration of silica or polymeric materials and switching optical signals may involve many cycles of interconversion between different colored states. A colorless/colored state may be maintained by constant irradiation or chemical trapping.",[Francisco M.

The inventors have developed a synthetic nucleic acid sensor-effector gene circuit. In cells without a target gene, the circuit suppresses e.g., effector production, but in the presence of the target gene the suppression is subject to competition, such that the synthetic sensor is de-repressed and permits expression of the effector gene. The methods and compositions described further permit the selective expression of an effector gene in those cells expressing the target gene. In this manner, cells expressing a target gene can be selectively targeted for treatment or elimination. In certain aspects, the methods and compositions described permit the selective expression of an agent such as a therapeutic gene product, in a specifically targeted population of cells in an organism.",[James J.

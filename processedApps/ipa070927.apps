A substituted [1,3]oxazine compound described as having a general (i.e., unsubstituted) structure with fused indoline and benzooxazine fragments such that they share a common bond in the [1,3]oxazine compound: (i) the bond connecting positions 1 and 2 of the indoline fragment and (ii) the bond connecting positions 2 and 3 of the benzooxazine fragment. Irradiation by light of suitable wave-length and intensity of this photochromic compound induces cleavage of a [Câ€”O] bond of the [1,3]oxazine ring to form a phenolate chromophore. The photogenerated (e.g., colored) isomer may revert thermally to the starting (e.g., colorless) oxazine. Alternatively, the switch may be between isomers of the compound that absorb at different wavelengths. Reversible coloration of silica or polymeric materials and switching optical signals may involve many cycles of interconversion between different colored states. A colorless/colored state may be maintained by constant irradiation or chemical trapping.

The resist material is one that that inhibits or prevents the further deposition of cells or other biomaterial; it thus masks the cationic surface from application of biomaterials. In one embodiment the resist material is a carboxy functional oxyalkylene oligomer.

10303653,20070927,20070224399,THICK POROUS ANODIC ALUMINA FILMS AND NANOWIRE ARRAYS GROWN ON A SOLID SUBSTRATE,"The presently disclosed invention provides for the fabrication of porous anodic alumina (PAA) films on a wide variety of substrates. The substrate comprises a wafer layer and may further include an adhesion layer deposited on the wafer layer. An anodic alumina template is formed on the substrate. When a rigid substrate such as Si is used, the resulting anodic alumina film is more tractable, easily grown on extensive areas in a uniform manner, and manipulated without danger of cracking. The substrate can be manipulated to obtain free-standing alumina templates of high optical quality and substantially flat surfaces PAA films can also be grown this way on patterned and non-planar surfaces. Furthermore, under certain conditions the resulting PAA is missing the barrier layer (partially or completely) and the bottom of the pores can be readily accessed electrically. The resultant film can be used as a template for forming an array of nanowires wherein the nanowires are deposited electrochemically into the pores of the template. By patterning the electrically conducting adhesion layer, pores in different areas of the template can be addressed independently, and can be filled electrochemically by different materials. Single-stage and multi-stage nanowire-based thermoelectric devices, consisting of both n-type and p-type nanowires, can be assembled on a silicon substrate by this method ",[Oded Rabin][Paul Herz][Mildred Dresselhaus][Akintunde Akinwande][Yu-Ming Lin],""," This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) to provisional patent application Ser.

The method includes the steps of contacting neoplastic cells with a gadolinium-containing compound for a time sufficient to allow the gadolinium-containing compound to be internalized within the neoplastic cells. The neoplastic cells are then exposed to a photon flux sufficient to induce emission of Auger electrons from the gadolinium-containing compound. The emitted Auger electrons induce non-reparable double-stranded DNA cleavage within the neoplastic cells, which thus inhibits the growth of the neoplastic cells.

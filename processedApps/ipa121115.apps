The array of electron beamlets is then focused to reduce the spacing that separates the electron beamlets. The transverse-axis spacing of the electron beamlets is then transferred to the longitudinal axis via an emittance exchange beamline, creating a periodically modulated distribution of coherent electronic current. The coherent electronic current can then be directed into a stream of photons to generate coherent radiation.","",[Massachusetts Institute of Technology],"",20110511,"The invention was supported, in whole or in part, by Grant DMR-1042342 from the National Science Foundation.

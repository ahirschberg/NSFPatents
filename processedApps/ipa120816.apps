The method uses filters to approximate viscous alignment and to thereby determine displacement fields having meaningful structure. In various embodiments a power-law energy spectrum is utilized for deformations in the displacement field through the application of a set of Gabor filters. The Gabor filters are applied in a sequential manner to gradient error images and values of modes of motions corresponding to the Gabor filters are determined.

13502411,20120816,20120207625,THERMALLY DRIVEN KNUDSEN PUMP,"The present invention relates to thermally driven pumps. More specifically, one embodiment of the present invention relates to the use of a thermoelectric material to create a thermally driven, bi-directional pump, such as a micro pump, with no moving parts using the thermal transpiration effect (a Knudsen pump). One embodiment of the thermally driven pump of the present invention utilizes a thermoelectric material to assist with the thermal transpiration process resulting in a substantially symmetrical, bidirectional pump. A thermoelectric module is used to induce a temperature gradient across a nanoporous article having at least one nanochannel thus creating fluid flow via thermal transpiration across the nanochannel. The use of the thermoelectric module eliminates the need for a heat sink thereby making the pump substantially symmetrical and enabling bidirectional flow which is accomplished by reversing the polarity of the power supply to the thermoelectric module resulting in reversing the direction of heat transfer.A second embodiment of the thermally driven pump of the present invention comprises a uni-directional, pneumatic, micro fluidic, Knudsen pump which can be integrated into a lab-on-chip device and is configured to pump liquids. The Knudsen pump of the second embodiment is generally comprised of a channel system comprised of a nanochannel and a shallow channel embedded in a bottom substrate and capable of alignment in series with other channels within a lab-on-chip substrate. The nanochannel and shallow channel are both covered by a second substrate comprised of material conducive to finalize creation of the Knudsen channels. A heater is also included within the nanochannel to induce gas flow by thermal transpiration which pneumatically moves liquid through the channels of a lab-on-chip.","","[UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE RESEARCH FOUNDATION, INC.]","This application is a national stage of PCT/US10/53790 filed Oct. 22, 2010, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 61/254,248 which was filed on Oct. 23, 2009 and U.S. Provisional Application 61/296,901 which was filed on Jan. 21, 2010, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",20101022,"This invention was made with Government support under Grant Nos.

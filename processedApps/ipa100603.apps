In one aspect, two or more magnetically-decoupled layers may be deposited on an AFM probe in order to create an active magnetic region at about the apex of the probe tip with dimensions less than about 10 nanometers. In another aspect, nanoscale patterning techniques may be employed to fabricate probe tips that possess plateau features. These plateau features may serve as substrates for the deposition of magnetic films having properties similar to magnetic recording media. Machining techniques, such as Focused Ion Beam (FIB) may be further employed to reduce the size of the magnetic materials deposited upon the substrate. Beneficially, because the plateaus of the substrate are substantially flat and of known geometry, and the magnetic properties of magnetic films deposited on flat surfaces are similar to those deposited upon the plateau, the magnetization of the MFM probe tips may be determined to high accuracy. In this manner, fine control over the magnetic properties of MFM probe tips may be achieved, providing enhanced MFM resolution.",[Nissim Amos][Sakhrat Khizroev][Rabee Ikkawi][Robert Haddon][Robert Fernandez],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7; 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/118,399, filed on Nov. 26, 2008 and entitled, &#x201C;PLATEAU PROBES FOR ENHANCED MAGNETIC FORCE MICROSCOPY,&#x201D; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/248,998, filed on Oct. 6, 2009 and entitled, &#x201C;MAGNETIC FORCE MICROSCOPY WITH SUB-10-nm RESOLUTION UNDER AMBIENT CONDITIONS.&#x201D; The entirety of each of these applications is incorporated herein by reference.",20091120,"This invention was made with Government support under Contract Numbers H94003-07-2-0703, awarded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and Grant No. 0712445 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

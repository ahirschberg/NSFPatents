The active layers are sandwiched between ion blocking electrodes, typically metal and/or transparent conducting oxide, that are electrically but not ionically conductive. Application of bias to the electrodes results in the polarization of ions at the electrodes thereby generating a field to drive the injection of electronic carriers into the active layer. The injected electron and holes recombine within the active layers to emit light. The ability to balance electron and hole injection in the design of such devices provides for optimal light emission efficiency.",[Mark C. Lonergan][Calvin H. W. Cheng][Dean H.

The method is based on a physics-based two parameter process model and measuring at two different cutting conditions. The process model parameters are measured with easily accessible spindle power. In contrast to spindle power alone which is influenced by many factors, most especially by variable cutting conditions and by the tool condition, the process model parameters are independent of the geometrically variable cutting conditions and provide a simple and direct measure of tool wear. The two process model parameters change differently depending on the mechanism of the tool wear, specifically flank wear versus cutting edge degradation. This provides a diagnostic for tool wear.",[Robert B. Jerard][Donald Esterling][Barry K.

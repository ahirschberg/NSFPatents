11342450,20070201,20070023489,Method of joining components using amorphous brazes and reactive multilayer foil,"In accordance with the invention, a first body is joined to a second body by joining a first amorphous braze layer to a surface of the first body and joining a second amorphous braze layer to a surface of the second body. A reactive multilayer foil is then disposed between the first and second amorphous braze layers. The layers are pressed together and the foil is ignited. Since the bodies can be joined to the braze layers by processes that do not require a furnace and the braze-coated bodies can be joined by the foil without a furnace, the method can produce strong brazed joints in typical workshop and field environments. Preferably the amorphous braze is a bulk metallic glass.

The formation of ionically conducting liquids of this type having conductivities of unprecedented magnitude for non-aqueous systems is described.

Both neutral proton transfer salts and the acid salts with HSOanions, give good results, the bisulphate case being particularly good at low temperatures and very high temperatures. The performance of all electrolytes is improved by the addition of a small amount of involatile base of pKvalue intermediate between those of the acid and base that make the bulk electrolyte.

11513760,20070201,20070026447,Nucleotides,"The present invention is directed to a method of sequencing a target nucleic acid molecule having a plurality of bases. In its principle, the temporal order of base additions during the polymerization reaction is measured on a molecule of nucleic acid, i.e. the activity of a nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme on the template nucleic acid molecule to be sequenced is followed in real time. The sequence is deduced by identifying which base is being incorporated into the growing complementary strand of the target nucleic acid by the catalytic activity of the nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme at each step in the sequence of base additions. A polymerase on the target nucleic acid molecule complex is provided in a position suitable to move along the target nucleic acid molecule and extend the oligonucleotide primer at an active site. A plurality of labelled types of nucleotide analogs are provided proximate to the active site, with each distinguishable type of nucleotide analog being complementary to a different nucleotide in the target nucleic acid sequence. The growing nucleic acid strand is extended by using the polymerase to add a nucleotide analog to the nucleic acid strand at the active site, where the nucleotide analog being added is complementary to the nucleotide of the target nucleic acid at the active site. The nucleotide analog added to the oligonucleotide primer as a result of the polymerizing step is identified. The steps of providing labelled nucleotide analogs, polymerizing the growing nucleic acid strand, and identifying the added nucleotide analog are repeated so that the nucleic acid strand is further extended and the sequence of the target nucleic acid is determined.

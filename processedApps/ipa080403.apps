11899309,20080403,20080078240,Scanner for probe microscopy,"A scanner for probe microscopy that avoids low resonance frequencies and accounts better for piezo nonlinearities. The x, y and z axes of a linear stack scanner are partially decoupled from each other while maintaining all mechanical joints stiff in the direction of actuation. The scanning probe microscope comprises a probe, a housing, at least two actuators, each coupled to the housing, and a support coupled to the housing and to at least a first of the actuators at a position spaced from the point at which the actuator is coupled to the housing. The support constrains the motion of the first actuator along a first axis while permitting translation along a second axis. The actuators are preferably orthogonally arranged linear stacks of flat piezos, preferably in push-pull configuration. The support can take different forms in different embodiments of the invention. In a particular embodiment, the scanner is a 2D scanner having a support frame with x and y axes, and a member for supporting an object to be moved such as a sample for a probe, the scanner comprising a flexure and flexure coupled cross-conformed piezos arranged along x and y axes. Expansion of the piezos is measured by at least two strain gauges disposed to measure the differential motion of at least two opposed actuators. The strain gauges are preferably arranged to compensate for ambient temperature changes, and preferably two or more strain gauges of identical type are disposed on each actuator to magnify the strain signal.

11881100,20080403,20080079515,Monolithic thin-film piezoelectric filters,"Disclosed are exemplary monolithic acoustically coupled thin film piezoelectric-on-substrate filters that operate in a wide frequency range. The monolithic thin-film-piezoelectric acoustic filters includes a resonant structure that is released from and supported by a substrate that comprises a thin-film piezoelectric layer disposed between a lower electrode and a plurality of electrically isolated upper electrodes. Second order narrowband filters are realized by utilizing coupled resonance modes of a single microstructure. Narrow-bandwidth filters are disclosed that are suitable for channel-select applications in IF and RF bands. Filter Q values of 800 at 250 MHz, 470 at 360 MHz, and 400 at 3.5 GHz for small footprint second-order filters are disclosed. The measured power handling of these devices is high due to the use of high energy density structural material, showing a 0.2 dB compression point of &gt;15 dBm at 360 MHz.

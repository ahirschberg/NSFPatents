In some cases, the parent droplet is split into at least first and second droplets which each are directed to separate channels. In some cases, the channels may be constructed and arranged such that the droplet velocities of the first and second droplets are substantially the same as the velocity of the parent droplet. In some cases, such droplets may be repeatedly split, e.g., a parent droplet is divided into 2 daughter droplets, then each droplet split again, etc., for example, such that one parent droplet may eventually be split into 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, etc. daughter droplets.

11599726,20070607,20070125160,Short and thin silicon cantilever with tip and fabrication thereof,"Thin and short cantilevers possess both a low force constant and a high resonance frequency, thus are highly desirable for atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging and force measurement. According to some embodiments, the invention provides small silicon (Si) cantilevers integrated with a Si tip, for example fabricated from SOI wafers that are used for reducing the variation of thickness of the cantilevers. In one example, the fabrication process provided SOI chips containing 40 silicon cantilevers integrating with an ultra-sharp Si tip. The resolution of images obtained with these tips was much higher than those obtained with the commercial tips, while the force constants were much less, that is, more suitable for imaging soft samples. The availability of such SOI chips greatly facilitates large scale modification of the surfaces of the silicon cantilever tips with a monolayer of oligo(ethylene glycol) derivatives that resist the non-specific interactions with proteins, rendering them most suitable for imaging and measurement of biological samples.

The technique receives a seed voxel within the white matter structure from an individual, determines thresholds and selection criteria, creates a binary mask based on the at least one threshold and the at least one selection criteria and calculates the boundary of the white matter structure based on the binary mask. A magnification factor is applied to each component of the eigenvectors of voxels. Boundary voxels are determined wherein each of the boundary voxels has a magnitude above a predetermined value and is located next to a voxel having a magnitude below the predetermined value. A vector is drawn from the seed voxel to a boundary voxel and the boundary voxels are connected together, thereby forming the region of interest within the connected boundary voxels.

Labeling reagents that are reactive to particular compound classes and differ only in their isotopic kit facilitating relative quantification and providing tangible evidence for the existence of specific functional groups. Heavy and light isotopic forms of methylacetimidate were synthesized and used as labeling reagents for quantification of amine-containing molecules, such as biological samples. Heavy and light isotopic forms of formaldehyde and cholamine were also synthesized and used independently as labeling reagents for quantification of amine-containing and carboxylic acid-containing molecules, such as found in biological samples. Advantageously, the labeled end-products are positively charged under normal acidic conditions involving conventional Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) applications. Labeled primary and secondary amine and carboxylic acid end-products also generated higher signals concerning mass-spectra than pre-cursor molecules and improved sensitivity. Improved accuracy concerning relative quantification was achieved by mixing heavy and light labeled extracts in different ratios. Labeling strategy was further employed to ascertain differences in the amounts of amine-containing metabolites for two strains of seeds.

More specifically, the invention concerns the use of controlled soft acid-base coordination reactions between molecular complexes and colloidal nanostructures to drive the nanoscale monocrystalline growth of the semiconductor shell with a lattice structure incommensurate with that of the core. The invention also relates to more complex hybrid core-shell structures that exhibit azimuthal and radial nano-tailoring of structures. The invention is additionally directed to the use of such compositions in semiconductor devices.","","[University of Maryland, College Park]","This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Ser.

Composition feedback is qualitative in nature and responds by retrieving highly aesthetic exemplar images from the corpus which are similar in content and composition to the snapshot. Color combination feedback provides confidence on the snapshot to contain good color combinations. Overall aesthetics feedback predicts the aesthetic ratings for both color and monochromatic images. An algorithm is used to provide ratings for color images, while new features and a new model are developed to treat monochromatic images. This system was designed keeping the next generation photography needs in mind and is the first of its kind. The feedback rendered is guiding and intuitive in nature. It is computed in situ while requiring minimal input from the user.","",[The Penn State Research Foundation],"This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

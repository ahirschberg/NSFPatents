The mechanical components are similar to a fingertip, with a rigid core surrounded by a weakly conductive fluid contained within an elastomeric skin. The deformable properties of the finger pad can be used as part of a transduction process. Multiple electrodes can be mounted on the surface of the rigid core and connected to impedance measuring circuitry within the core. External forces deform the fluid path around the electrodes, resulting in a distributed pattern of impedance changes containing information about those forces and the objects that applied them. Strategies are described for extracting features related to the mechanical inputs and using this information for reflexive grip control. Controlling grip force in a prosthetic having sensory feedback information is described.

Each pixel of the an M-channel input image illuminated by N light sources is linearly transformed into a new color space having (M−N) channels. For an RGB image with one light source, the new color space has two color channels (U,V) that are free of specularities and a third channel (S) that contains both specular and diffuse components. When used with multiple light sources, the transformation may be used to produce a specular invariant image. A diffuse RGB image can be obtained by applying a non-linear partial differential equation to an RGB image to iteratively erode the specular component at each pixel. An optional third dimension of time may be added for processing video images. After the specular and diffuse components are separated, dichromatic editing may be used to independently process the diffuse and the specular components to add or suppress visual effects. The (U,V) channels of images can be used as input to 3-D shape estimation algorithms including shape-from-shading, photometric stereo, binocular and multinocular stereopsis, and structure-from-motion.",[Satya P.

12522634,20100610,20100144546,GENETIC SELECTION FOR PROTEIN FOLDING AND SOLUBILITY IN THE BACTERIAL PERIPLASM,"The present invention relates to the fields of microbiology, molecular biology and protein biochemistry. More particularly, it relates to compositions and methods for analyzing and altering (e.g., enhancing or inhibiting) protein folding and solubility (e.g., within periplasm). The present invention provides an engineered assay for protein folding and solubility in the periplasm based on co-translational translocation of a chimera comprising a protein of interest fused to TEM-I β-lactamase that is targeted for export via the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent pathway. Using an array of native and heterologous proteins, it is demonstrated that periplasmic folding behavior of proteins is intimately coupled to in vivo β-lactamase activity. As a result of this coupling, the reporter is useful for (1) facile discovery of extrinsic periplasmic factors that affect protein folding and solubility; and (2) genetic selection of solubility-enhanced proteins.",[Matthew P.

One embodiment of the use of motor proteins can be adding biotin-binding proteins to a substrate by patterning, binding biotinylated F-actin to the biotin-binding proteins, aligning the bound F-actin in a preferred direction using a flow field, and using myosin coated particles to transport items attached to the particle throughout the substrate. Another embodiment of the use of motor proteins can be adding biotin-binding proteins to a substrate by patterning, adding a flow field, injecting F-actin so that the F-actin is bound and aligned simultaneously, and using myosin coated particles to transport items attached to the particle throughout the substrate. In either embodiment the F-actin can be capped with a biotinylated cap before binding to the biotin-binding proteins.",[Parviz Famouri][Yongkuk Lee][Lenln Leon],[],"This application claims priority from provisional patent application No. 61/201,077 filed on Dec. 5, 2008.",20091204,This invention was made with government support under Grant No. ECS0403742 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

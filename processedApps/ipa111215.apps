The delivery system comprises a source electrode adapted to be positioned proximate to a target site of internal body tissue. A counter electrode is in electrical communication with the source electrode, and is configured to cooperate with the source electrode to form a localized electric field proximate to the target site. A reservoir is configured to be disposed such that the reservoir is capable of interacting with the localized electric field. The reservoir is configured to carry a cargo capable of being delivered to the target site when exposed to the localized electric field. Associated methods are also provided.",[Joseph Desimone][Mary Napier][Jonathan Pillai][James Byrne][Lukas Miller Roush][Jen Jen Yeh][Matt Parrott],"[LIQUIDIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.][THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL]","",20100225,This disclosure was partially made with U.S. Government support under contract number CHE-9876674 awarded by the United States National Science Foundation and Technology Center.

A kit of (1) a panel of antibodies; (2) one or more gene amplification assays; (3) first reagents to assist said antibodies with binding to tumor samples; (4) second reagents to assist in determining gene amplification; permits, when applied to a breast cancer patient's tumor tissue sample, (A) permits observation, and determination, of a numerical level of expression of each individual antibody, and gene amplification; whereupon (B) a computer algorithm, residing on a computer can calculate a prediction of treatment outcome for a specific treatment for breast cancer, or future risk of breast cancer progression.",[Steven Linke][Troy Bremer][Comelius Diamond],"","The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

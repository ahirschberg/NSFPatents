The surface of the optical material is etched through a nanoporous polymer film etch mask to transfer the porous pattern to the optical material. The resultant nanostructured layer is an optical metamaterial since it contains structural features much smaller than the wavelength of light and the presence of these structural features change the effective index of refraction by controlling the degree of porosity in the nanostructured layer and also by controlling the thickness of the porous layer.,[Ozgur Yavuzcetin][Mark Thomas Tuominen][Thomas P.

The technique takes advantage of surface-enhanced plasmonic scattering of ultrashort laser pulses by nanoparticles to vaporize sub-cellular structures in attoliter volumes. The use of nanoparticles may overcome problems associated with current FLMS techniques and does not rely on heating for nanodisruption. In PLN, the particle acts as a “nano-lens,” restricting laser light to the near-field of the particle, and only photodisrupting structures that are nanometers away. This eliminates the need for a tightly focused beam, while still achieving nanoscale ablation resolution. Moreover, the enhanced scattering around the particles reduces the amount of required laser fluence. A method is provided comprising positioning a nanoparticle in proximity to a surface of a material; irradiating the nanoparticle with a laser tuned close to the nanoparticle's plasmonic frequency; and allowing a near-field effect from the irradiated nanoparticle to photodamage the material.",[Adela Ben-Yakar][Daniel Eversole][Xun Guo],"","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

The pairs of instructions that are to be executed atomically can be identified in different manners, such as by executing a program multiple times and using the results of those executions to automatically identify the pairs of instructions.",[Yuanyuan Zhou][Shan Lu][Joseph Andrew Tucek],"","",20070919,"This invention was made with Government support under Contract Number CCR-0325603 and Contract Number CNS-0347854, both awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and Contract Number DE-FG02-05ER25688 awarded by the Department of Energy (DOE).

Each of these constructs imposes only a small constant factor of the computational burden (time) of the function itself, and the forward construct has the same properties in terms of space. The functions can be applied to any function, including those involving derivatives and nested closures.",[Jeffrey Mark Siskind][Barak Avrum Pearlmutter],"","This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/862,103, filed Oct. 19, 2006, and titled &#x201C;Automatic Derivative Method for a Computer Programming Language,&#x201D; which is hereby incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth.",20071019,This innovation was sponsored in part by NSF grant CCF-0438806 and in part by Science Foundation Ireland grant 00/PI.1/C067.

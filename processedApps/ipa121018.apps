A detecting pixel includes a sub-wavelength split-ring resonator, and is mechanically coupled to (but thermally decoupled from) a substrate via a cantilever formed from two materials that have a significant mismatch in their thermal expansion coefficients. Incident radiation causes the split-ring resonator to resonate, thereby generating heat that is transferred to the cantilever, causing the cantilever to flex. An optical readout system includes a secondary light source, such as a laser, that shines on a reflective surface on the pixel, whereby a photodiode detects the reflected light and permits calculation of a relative deflection of the pixel in the nanometer range. An exemplary detector has a noise equivalent power rating of approximately 60 pW/√Hz.","",[TRUSTEES OF BOSTON UNIVERSITY],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/389,625, filed Oct. 4, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.",20111004,"This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. HR0011-08-1-0044 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and Contract No. ECCS-0802036 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

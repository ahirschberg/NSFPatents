In addition, contrary to previous art, the sensor can measure the electric field gradient at its location. This is achieved by the use of a combination of quadrature modulation and phase-sensitive quadrature demodulation digital signal processing in a generic rotating electric-field sensor. Ground isolated versions of the instrument can be used singly or in arrays when precise measurements of the electric fields are necessary. Either grounded or isolated versions of the instrument can operate continuously without the need for internal batteries, making it extremely attractive for a wide-range of industrial and space applications. Operational modes have been developed to distinguish the effects of ion currents and charged particles impacting the sensor from the local ambient electric field.

Beneficially, such systems and methods allow the large-scale fabrication of electronic EG devices. Vigorous oxidative conditions may allow substantially complete removal of the EG carbon atoms and the generation of insulating regions; such processing is equivalent to that which is currently used in the semiconductor industry to lithographically etch or oxidize silicon and thereby define the physical features and electronic structure of the devices. However graphene offers an excellent opportunity for controlled modification of the hybridization of the carbon atoms from spto spstates by chemical addition of organic functional groups. We show that such chemistries offer opportunities far beyond those currently employed in the semiconductor industry for control of the local electronic structure of the graphene sheet and do not require the physical removal of areas of graphene or its oxidation, in order to generate the full complement of electronic devices necessary to produce functional electronic circuitry. Selective saturation of the π-bonds opens a band gap in the graphene electronic structure which results in a semiconducting or insulating form of graphene, while allowing the insertion of new functionality with the possibility of 3-D electronic architectures.

The reduced dyes exhibit little or no fluorescence due to the disrupted π conjugation. However, upon reaction with ROS, the reduced dyes are oxidized, regenerating the extended π conjugation and causing a substantial increase in fluorescence intensity. In many case, the oxidized dye is generally membrane impermeable. However, upon reduction, many of the reduced dyes are membrane permeable.

The nanowire synthesis is all inorganic and occurs at low temperatures (e.g., &lt;=60° C.). The growth inhibition may be predictively modeled, using speciation plots and treating non-zinc complex ions as ligands. Microfluidic channels may be used for the synthesis, with different solutions flowing down different channels, permitting nanowires with different properties to be synthesized in parallel.

13033352,20110623,20110150854,"RIBOSWITCHES, METHODS FOR THEIR USE, AND COMPOSITIONS FOR USE WITH RIBOSWITCHES","It has been discovered that certain natural mRNAs serve as metabolite-sensitive genetic switches wherein the RNA directly binds a small organic molecule. This binding process changes the conformation of the mRNA, which causes a change in gene expression by a variety of different mechanisms. Modified versions of these natural “riboswitches” (created by using various nucleic acid engineering strategies) can be employed as designer genetic switches that are controlled by specific effector compounds. Such effector compounds that activate a riboswitch are referred to herein as trigger molecules. The natural switches are targets for antibiotics and other small molecule therapies.

The photoresist can comprise a liquid crystal and a photo-sensitive material, including, for example, a photo-sensitive monomer and/or polymer. The two laser beams can be first directed towards one side of the photoresist. In the areas subjected to lighter fringes, the polymer molecules can link together and force the liquid crystal into the areas subjected to the darker fringes. This can leave an alternating pattern of linear strips of polymer-rich and liquid crystal-rich regions. The exposure time can be limited so that the strips are formed only partially through the thickness of the photoresist. The photoresist can be then rotated 90 degrees and the overlapping laser beams directed towards the opposite side of the photoresist. Alternating strips of polymer-rich and liquid crystal-rich regions can be formed that extend partially through the photoresist. These strips can be arranged orthogonally to the strips formed on the opposite side of the photoresist. The material in liquid crystal-rich regions can be washed out when the photoresist is developed. A two-layer, integrated phase mask can therefore be produced. Exemplary methods eliminate the need for complicated alignment techniques.",[Yuankun Lin][Karen Lozano][Ahmad Harb][Daniel Rodriguez Ponce],[The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System],"This application claims priority to Application Ser.

The silicon substrate is etched to substantially completely remove native oxide. It is promptly placed in a reaction chamber. The substrate is heated and maintained at a growth temperature. Group III-V precursors are flowed for a growth time. Preferred embodiment vertical Group III-V nanowires on silicon have a core-shell structure, which provides a radial homojunction or heterojunction. A doped nanowire core is surrounded by a shell with complementary doping. Such can provide high optical absorption due to the long optical path in the axial direction of the vertical nanowires, while reducing considerably the distance over which carriers must diffuse before being collected in the radial direction. Alloy composition can also be varied. Radial and axial homojunctions and heterojunctions can be realized. Embodiments provide for flexible Group III-V nanowire structures. An array of Group III-V nanowire structures is embedded in polymer. A fabrication method forms the vertical nanowires on a substrate, e.g., a silicon substrate.

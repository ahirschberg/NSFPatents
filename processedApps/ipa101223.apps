12918284,20101223,20100319451,Temperature-Robust MEMS Gyroscope with 2-DOF Sense-Mode Addressing the Tradeoff Between Bandwith and Gain,"The current invention is a novel gyroscope design, which yields devices robust to fabrication and environmental variations, allows flexible selection of operational parameters, and provides increased bandwidth minimized sacrifice in gain regardless of the selected frequency of operation. The gyroscope has a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) drive-mode and a 2-DOF sense-mode. The drive-mode operational frequency and the sense-mode bandwidth can be selected arbitrarily in the proposed design, relaxing the tradeoff between the gain, die size, and detection capacitance. The symmetry of the structure ensures the optimal location of the drive-mode resonance relative to the sense-mode operational region, even in presence of fabrication imperfections.",[Alexander Trusov][Adam Schofield][Andrei Shkel],[THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA],"The present application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

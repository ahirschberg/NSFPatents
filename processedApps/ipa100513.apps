In one embodiment, the actuator can be threaded into at least a portion of the structure, and can be moved rotationally between a first position, causing relatively greater constriction of a microfluidic fluid path, and a second position causing relatively lesser constriction of the fluid path. Actuating the actuator, e.g., by rotation, can deform material between the valve and the fluid path, thereby constricting at least a portion of the underlying fluid path and regulating the flow of a fluid in the fluid path. In another aspect, the invention provides a reservoir into which fluid can be placed and from which fluid can be introduced into a microfluidic system.

The system includes network authority software that issues a permanent identity and secret code to a user and disseminates different hashed versions of the permanent identity and secret code to different agents. A user hardware Internet passport generates hashed versions of the permanent identity and secret code as well as a passcode that is generated from the hashed secret code and user software generates a temporary identity from the hashed permanent identity. The user software transmits the temporary identity and passcode to a selected agent that performs the actual identity validation.",[Leiwen Deng][Aleksandar Kuzmanovic],"","",20090929,This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant CNS-0831654.,"","","",""

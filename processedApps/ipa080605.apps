Quasi-particle interferometry is a tool for constructing topologically protected gates. Assuming the corrections of the Moore-Read Model for ν= 5/2's FQHE (Nucl. Phys. B 360, 362 (1991)) we show how to manipulate the collective state of two e/4-charge anti-dots in order to switch said collective state from one carrying trivial SU(2) charge, |1&gt;, to one carrying a fermionic SU(2) charge |∈&gt;. This is a NOT gate on the {|1&gt;, |∈&gt;} qubit and is effected by braiding of an electrically charged quasi particle σ which carries an additional SU(2)-charge.

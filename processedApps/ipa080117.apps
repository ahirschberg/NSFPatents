11671776,20080117,20080011416,METHOD FOR BONDING AND DEBONDING A WORKPIECE TO A MANUFACTURING FIXTURE,"A system and a method by which workpieces are bonded to and debond from a manufacturing fixture using a radiation responsive adhesive as a bonding agent. The system includes curing the adhesive agent during loading within seconds, and structurally weakens the adhesive bond during unloading within seconds. During the workpiece loading cycle, an adhesive dispenser deposits radiation responsive adhesive on to a load bearing, light transmittive surface, known as gripper pins. The workpiece is subsequently pushed against the locators, and towards the gripper pins causing the adhesive to interpose between workpiece and gripper pins, curing radiant energy is transmitted through the gripper pins and on to the adhesive to cure adhesive and bond the workpiece to the fixture. Therefore, the bond is structurally weakened or debonded in order to remove the workpiece from the fixture after manufacturing.

Rigorous Coupled-Wave Analysis simulations predict a more tightly confined resonant electric field at the surface of this biosensor as compared to previously fabricated near-infrared photonic-crystal biosensors. This change in the resonant electric field provides an improvement of over 4.5 times in the surface-sensitivity to bulk-sensitivity ratio, and therefore enables enhanced detection resolution for biomolecules adsorbed on the biosensor surface. These new biosensors can be fabricated in mass by replica molding. They are especially well suited for applications requiring the detection of small molecules or ultra-low analyte concentrations.

11897180,20071227,20070297680,Shape grammar interpreter,"Parametric shape recognition is achieved through a decomposition of shapes into a hierarchy of subshapes ordered by their decreasing restrictions. Instances of each of the subshapes are individually located in the design shape and then reconstructed to form an instance of the entire shape. The basis for the hierarchy of subshapes can be specified by the designer or based on the default parameter relations that come from architectural and engineering knowledge. The levels of the hierarchy are defined so that the most constrained lines of a shape are those lines that the designer intended exactly. These most constrained lines have specified parametric relations to other line segments and those relations, if altered, will compromise the designer's intentions. Conversely, the lowest level of the hierarchy, which contains the least constrained line segments, only implies a specific connectivity between line segments, necessitating a vaster search. The parametric recognition of curved line shapes uses a two-step approach that first performs shape matching with an equivalent straight-line shape then checks those transformations for matching with the actual curved lines. This approach has advantages over just matching characteristic polygons in that it can match equivalent curves with differing characteristic polygons as well as emergent shapes.

Two laser-based imaging techniques based on particle image velocimetry (PIV) and optical patternation are provided to map and contrast the size and velocity distributions for indirect and direct pneumatic nebulizations in plasma spectrometry. The flow field of droplets is illuminated by two pulses from a thin laser sheet with a known time difference. The scattering of the laser light from droplets is captured by a charge coupled device (CCD), providing two instantaneous images of the particles. Pointwise cross-correlation of the corresponding images yields a two-dimensional (2-D) velocity map of the aerosol velocity field. For droplet size distribution studies, the solution is doped with a fluorescent dye and both laser induced florescence (LIF) and Mie scattering images are captured simultaneously by two CCDs with the same field of view. The ratio of the LIF/Mie images provides relative droplet size information, which is then scaled by a point calibration method via a phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA). Two major outcomes are realized for three nebulization systems: 1) a direct injection high efficiency nebulizer (DIHEN); 2) a large-bore DIHEN (LB-DIHEN); and 3) a PFA microflow nebulizer with a PFA Scott-type spray chamber. First, the central region of the aerosol cone from the direct injection nebulizers and the nebulizer-spray chamber arrangement comprise fast (&gt;13 m/s and &gt;8 m/s, respectively) and fine (&lt;10 μm and &lt;5 μm, respectively) droplets as compared to slow (&lt;4 m/s) and large (&gt;25 μm) droplets in the fringes. Second, the spray chamber acts as a momentum separator, rather than a droplet size selector, as it removes droplets having larger sizes or velocities. Smart-tunable nebulizers may utilize the measured momentum as a feedback control for adjusting certain operation properties of the nebulizer, such as operating conditions and/or critical dimensions.

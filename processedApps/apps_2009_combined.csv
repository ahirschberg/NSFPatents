The algorithm progresses iteratively adding a new basis function at each step to refine the model. The placement of the basis functions is driven by a statistical hypothesis test that reveals geometric structure when it fails. At each step the added function is fit to data contained in a spatio-temporally defined local region to determine the parameters, in particular, the scale of the local model. The proposed method requires no ad hoc parameters. Thus, the number of basis functions required for an accurate fit is determined automatically by the algorithm. The approach may be applied to problems including modeling data on manifolds and the prediction of financial time-series.

To determine thermal stability, the powders were sealed in glass tubes in an Ar atmosphere to avoid oxidation and contamination and annealed at different temperatures between 423 and 773K for different holding times. Following these treatments, the grain size of cryomilled Al+1% diamantane was consistently less than that for cryomilled Al by about a factor of two. Preliminary investigations indicate that the grain growth exponent n decreased with increasing temperature, reaching a value of approximately 35 at 423 K.

The method is based on low-complexity post-FFT signal processing. Minimum mean square error combining of signals is performed for signals received at spatially-distributed receiver elements using adaptive channel estimation and phase tracking. Doppler shifts are modeled as a consequence of motion-induced time compression and dilation. The Doppler rate is assumed constant over one OFDM block but can vary between OFDM blocks. Thus a non-constant Doppler shift is accommodated by the method. Non-uniform Doppler compensation across subchannels is based on adaptive estimation and prediction of the Doppler rate. A single adaptively estimated parameter is used to track the phases of all the carriers and channel estimates are updated on a block by block basis.",[Milica Stojanovic],[MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY],"",20070911,"This invention was produced utilizing U.S. Government support under Grant Number OCE-0532223, awarded by the National Science Foundation and under Grant Number N00014-05-G0106, awarded by the U.S. Navy.

The use of nanoparticles may overcome problems associated with current FLMS techniques and does not rely on heating for nanodisruption. In PLN, the particle acts as a “nano-lens,” restricting laser light to the near-field of the particle, and only photodisrupting structures that are nanometers away. This eliminates the need for a tightly focused beam, while still achieving nanoscale ablation resolution. Moreover, the enhanced scattering around the particles reduces the amount of required laser fluence.

Inspired by inductive transfer, the approach harnesses available information, including the black-box model's performance, the image representations, and a semantic lexicon ontology. Being computationally ‘lightweight.’ the meta-learner efficiently re-trains over time, to improve and/or adapt to changes. The black-box annotation model is not required to be re-trained, allowing computationally intensive algorithms to be used. Both batch and online annotation settings are accommodated. A “tagging over time” approach produces progressively better annotation, significantly outperforming the black-box as well as the static form of the meta-learner, on real-world data.",[Ritendra Datta][Dhiraj Joshi][Jia Li][James Z.

12236396,20090326,20090083390,AUTOMATIC CLUSTERING FOR SELF-ORGANIZING GRIDS,"Computational grids have traditionally not scaled effectively due to administrative hurdles to resource and user participation. Most production grids are essentially multi-site supercomputer centers, rather than truly open and heterogeneous sets of resources that can join and leave dynamically, and that can provide support for an equally dynamic set of users. Large-scale grids containing individual resources with more autonomy about when and how they join and leave will require self-organizing grid middleware services that do not require centralized administrative control. Dynamic discovery of high-performance variable-size clusters of grid nodes provides an effective solution for implementation of grids. A brute force approach to the problem of identifying these “ad-hoc clusters” would require excessive overhead in terms of both message exchange and computation. Therefore, a scalable solution is provided that uses a delay-based overlay structure to organize nodes based on their proximity to one another, using a small number of delay experiments. This overlay can then be used to provide a variable-size set of promising candidate nodes than can then be used as a cluster, or tested further to improve the selection. Simulation results show that this approach results in effective clustering with acceptable overhead.",[Nael Abu-Ghazaleh][Weishuai Yang][Michael Lewis],[THE RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK],"",20080923,"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant ACI-0133838, CNS-0454298, and by the Air Force Research Laboratories under contract FA8750-04-1-0054.","","","",""

After obtaining a new video chunk, a peer keeps transmitting (uploading) that video chunk to other peers until all peers receive it. The approach quickly increases the aggregate bandwidth that can be utilized to transmit a video chunk. For example, the aggregate peer bandwidth used to transmit a video chunk can double every time slot. For a homogeneous P2P streaming system with N peers, a time slot is defined as a unit of the single chunk transmission delay between two peers. Using the P2P streaming method, a video chunk can be disseminated to all peers within 1+logN time slots.",[Yong LIU],"","This application claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

With this method, the message bits are divided into multiple submessages and the bits in each layer are encoded using a standard error correction code to provide a plurality of subcodewords. A first linear transformation is applied to each of the subcodewords. The so-transformed subcodewords from the different submessages are then combined to form a first redundancy block to be transmitted. Additional redundancy blocks are generated by repeating this process on the same message but with jointly related nonidentical sets of linear transformations. The result is a set of codewords for each message which are then used to generate a transmitted waveform in one of several different ways, depending upon the application. For example, the codewords can be used in sequence (temporally) to form a rateless code for transmission over channels of unknown quality, in which case a receiver accumulates as many of the codewords as are necessary to successfully decode. As another example, the codewords can be spatially distributed if the channel has multiple-inputs, as would be the case in a multi-antenna system. As still another example, the codewords can be distributed over subchannels in a frequency-division multiplexing system.",[Gregory W.

Nanomaterials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can significantly enhance enzyme function and stability in strongly denaturing environments. Experimental results and theoretical analysis reveal that the enhancement in stability is a result of the curvature of these nanoscale materials, which suppresses unfavorable protein-protein interactions. The enhanced stability is also exploited in the preparation of highly stable and active nanocomposite films that resist nonspecific protein absorption, i.e., inhibit fouling of the films. The protein-nanoparticles conjugates represent a new generation of highly selective, active, and stable catalytic materials. Furthermore, the ability to enhance protein function by interfacing them with nanomaterials has a profound impact on applications ranging from biosensing, diagnostics, vaccines, drug delivery, and biochips, to novel hybrid materials that integrate biotic and abiotic components.",[Jonathan S.

The α,β-unsaturated nitrone functionality of avrainvillamide and its 3-alkylidene-3H-indole 1-oxide core is shown to covalently and reversibly bond to heteroatom-based nucleophiles. This capability may allow these molecules to bind active site nucleophiles and may provide the basis for designing potent and selective enzyme inhibitors. Both avrainvillamide and its dimer stephacidin B have been reported to exhibit antiproliferative activity, and avrainvillamide has been reported to exhibit antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant bacteria. Avrainvillamide has been found to target cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein (CLIMP-63) thereby preventing cells from undergoing mitosis.

12058105,20091001,20090244300,METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MOTION INVARIANT IMAGING,"Object motion during camera exposure often leads to noticeable blurring artifacts. Proper elimination of this blur is challenging because the blur kernel is unknown, varies over the image as a function of object velocity, and destroys high frequencies. In the case of motions along a 1D direction (e.g. horizontal), applicants show that these challenges can be addressed using a camera that moves during the exposure. Through the analysis of motion blur as space-time integration, applicants show that a parabolic integration (corresponding to constant sensor acceleration) leads to motion blur that is not only invariant to object velocity, but preserves image frequency content nearly optimally. That is, static objects are degraded relative to their image from a static camera, but all moving objects within a given range of motions reconstruct well. A single deconvolution kernel can be used to remove blur and create sharp images of scenes with objects moving at different speeds, without requiring any segmentation and without knowledge of the object speeds.",[Anat Levin][Peter Sand][Taeg Sang Cho][Fredo Durand][Willliam T.

Such sensor may find applications in broad areas of science and technology, from the analysis of diesel engine emissions to the detection of biological warfare agents. Particle detection is based on interferometric detection of multi-color light, scattered by the particle. On the fundamental level, the detected signal has a weaker dependence on particle size (ÿ R), compared to standard detection methods (ÿ R). This leads to a significantly larger signal-to-noise ratio for smaller particles. By using a multi-color or white excitation light, particle dielectric properties are probed at different frequencies. This scheme samples the frequency dependence of the particle's polarizability thereby making it possible to predict the composition of the particle material. The detection scheme also employs a heterodyne or pseudoheterodyne detection configuration, which allows it to reduce or eliminate noise contribution from phase variations, which appear in any interferometric measurements.",[Lukas Novotny][Filipp Ignatovich],"","The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/776,953, filed Feb. 28, 2006, whose disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure.",20070227,The work leading to the present invention was supported by NSF Grant No. PHS-0441964.

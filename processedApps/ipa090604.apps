The curriculum of some embodiments includes learning interactions that are designed to give a student substantive feedback when the student provides a response to a “puzzle-like” question. Puzzle-like questions are questions that have a solution space with a relatively large number of potential responses (e.g., with more than one correct answer or partially correct answer or partially incorrect response or incorrect response). Some embodiments provide assessment analysis for the puzzle-like questions. When a test taker provides an incorrect response or a partially correct response, for example, some embodiments present to the test taker prestored feedback regarding the particular misunderstanding that is associated with the response in order to explain the possible misunderstanding. Some embodiments perform the assessment analysis for puzzle-like questions by using a rule-based technique to describe multiple acceptable responses (e.g., one or more completely correct answers and one or more partially correct answers).

Nanomaterials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can significantly enhance enzyme function and stability in strongly denaturing environments. Experimental results and theoretical analysis reveal that the enhancement in stability is a result of the curvature of these nanoscale materials, which suppresses unfavorable protein-protein interactions. The enhanced stability is also exploited in the preparation of highly stable and active nanocomposite films that resist nonspecific protein absorption, i.e., inhibit fouling of the films. The protein-nanoparticles conjugates represent a new generation of highly selective, active, and stable catalytic materials. Furthermore, the ability to enhance protein function by interfacing them with nanomaterials has a profound impact on applications ranging from biosensing, diagnostics, vaccines, drug delivery, and biochips, to novel hybrid materials that integrate biotic and abiotic components.",[Jonathan S.

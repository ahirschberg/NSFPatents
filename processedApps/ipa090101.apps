In this regime, the pulse spectrum is modified by strong self-phase modulation and gain shaping. With large-enough nonlinear phase shift, substantial spectral broadening occurs. The amplified spectrum can therefore be much broader than the spectrum that is obtained with small nonlinear phase shifts. The broader spectrum enables the formation of a shorter pulse, and the bandwidth generated in nonlinear chirped-pulse amplification can in fact be exploited to generate shorter pulses. Ultimately, this allows the generation of pulses shorter than the gain-narrowing limit of a fiber amplifier.",[Frank W.

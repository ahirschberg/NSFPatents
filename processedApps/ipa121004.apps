The actuation of the droplet is achieved by introducing a diode into the idealized electrical circuit of the electrowetting system. The diode is in parallel with a capacitor (dielectric) and effectively shorts the droplet on the side of a lower potential electrode so that the entire voltage drop is across the dielectric over the opposite electrode. This creates an energy imbalance that moves the droplet towards the higher potential. If the voltage polarity is reversed, the direction of actuation will reverse as well.","",[University of South Florida],"This application is a continuation in part of prior filed International Application, Serial Number PCT/US2010/060,763 filed Dec. 16, 2010, which claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/286,944, entitled &#x201C;BIDIRECTIONAL ELECTROWETTING ACTUATION WITH VOLTAGE POLARITY DEPENDENCE,&#x201D; filed on Dec. 16, 2009, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",20120618,This invention was made with government support under Grant Nos.

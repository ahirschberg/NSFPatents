In addition, contrary to previous art, the sensor can measure the electric field gradient at its location. This is achieved by the use of a combination of quadrature modulation and phase-sensitive quadrature demodulation digital signal processing in a generic rotating electric-field sensor. Ground isolated versions of the instrument can be used singly or in arrays when precise measurements of the electric fields are necessary. Either grounded or isolated versions of the instrument can operate continuously without the need for internal batteries, making it extremely attractive for a wide-range of industrial and space applications. Operational modes have been developed to distinguish the effects of ion currents and charged particles impacting the sensor from the local ambient electric field. Moreover, particular versions of the instrument can be operated in corrosive environments and conducting fluids.",[Nilton O. Renno][Steven A.

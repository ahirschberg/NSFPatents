The elastic functions provide a knowledge-base of implementation alternatives and parallelization strategies for a given function. When an application calls an elastic function, the elastic computing tools analyze available devices and resources (e.g., cores, GPUs, FPGAs, etc.) and current run-time parameters, and then transparently select from numerous pre-analyzed implementation possibilities to optimize for performance, power, energy, size, or any combination of these goals.",[Gregory Michael Stitt][John Robert Wernsing],"","This application claims priority to co-pending U.S. provisional application entitled &#x201C;ELASTIC COMPUTING&#x201D;, having ser.

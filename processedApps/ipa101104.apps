12762993,20101104,20100281208,System and Method for Data Storage,"A data storage architecture is composed of an array of a flash memory solid state disk and a hard disk drive or any nonvolatile random access storage that are intelligently coupled by an intelligent processing unit such as a multi-core graphic processing unit. The solid state disk stores seldom-changed and mostly read reference data blocks while the hard disk drive stores compressed deltas between currently accessed I/O blocks and their corresponding reference blocks in the solid state disk so that random writes are not performed on the solid state disk during online I/O operations. The solid state disk and hard disk drive are controlled by the intelligent processing unit, which carries out high speed computations including similarity detection and delta compression/decompression. The architecture exploits the fast read performance of solid state disks and the high speed computation of graphic processing units to replace mechanical operations on hard disk drives while avoiding slow and wearing solid state drive writes.",[Qing Yang],"","This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

A processor is provided having a processor core, a cache memory, a plurality of registers for storing at least one hash value and at least one encryption key, a memory interface, and at least one on-chip instruction for creating a secure memory area in a memory external to the processor, and a hypervisor program executed by the processor. The hypervisor program instructs the processor to execute the at least one on-chip instruction to create a secure memory area for a software area for a software module, and the processor encrypts data written to, and decrypts data read from, the external memory using the at least one encryption key and the verifying data read from the external memory using the at least one hash value. Secure module interactions are provided, as well as the generation of a power-on key which can be used to protect memory in the event of a re-boot event. Lightweight, run-time attestation reports are generated which include selected information about software modules executed by the processors, for use in determining whether the processor is trusted to provide secure services.",[Ruby B.

12773686,20101104,20100281448,LOW-POWER FPGA CIRCUITS AND METHODS,"Field Programmable Logic Arrays (FPGAs) are described which utilize multiple power supply voltages to reduce both dynamic power and leakage power without sacrificing speed or substantially increasing device area. Power reduction mechanisms are described for numerous portions of the FPGA, including logic blocks, routing circuits, connection blocks, switch blocks, configuration memory cells, and so forth. Embodiments describe circuits and methods for implementing multiple supplies as sources of V, multiple voltage thresholding V, signal level translators, and power gating of circuitry to deactivate portions of the circuit which are inactive. The supply voltage levels can be fixed, or programmable. Methods are described for performing circuit CAD in the routing and assignment process on FPGAs, in particular for optimizing FPGA use having the power reduction circuits taught. Routing methods describe utilizing slack timing, power sensitivity, trace-based simulations, and other techniques to optimize circuit utilization on a multi VFPGA.",[Lei He],[THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA],"This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser.

13636935,20130502,20130105686,METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING NEUTRAL CHEMICAL UNITS VIA NANOSTRUCTURES,"Suspended nanotubes are used to capture and ionize neutral chemical units, such as individual atoms, molecules, and condensates, with excellent efficiency and sensitivity. Applying a voltage to the nanotube(s) (with respect to a grounding surface) creates an attractive potential between a polarizable neutral chemical unit and the nanotube that varies as 1/r2, where r is the unit's distance from the nanotube. An atom approaching the nanotube with a sub-threshold angular momentum is captured by the potential and eventually spirals towards the nanotube. The atom ionizes as in comes into close proximity with a sidewall of the nanotube, creating an ion whose polarity matches the polarity of the electric potential of the nanotube. Repulsive forces eject the ion, which can be detected more easily than a neutral chemical unit. Suspended nanotubes can be used to detect small numbers of neutral chemical units (e.g., single atoms) for applications in sensing and interferometry.",[Lene V. Hau][Jene A. Golovchenko][Anne L.

According to an example embodiment of the present invention, a digital imaging arrangement implements microlenses to direct light to photosensors that detect the light and generate data corresponding to the detected light. The generated data is used to compute an output image, where each output image pixel value corresponds to a selective weighting and summation of a subset of the detected photosensor values. The weighting is a function of characteristics of the imaging arrangement. In some applications, the weighting reduces the contribution of data from photosensors that contribute higher amounts of optical aberration to the corresponding output image pixel.",[Yi-Ren Ng][Patrick M.

Disclosed embodiments of the elastomer-based solution allows for curvature sensing directly on a bending plane and thus eliminates limitations imposed by strain gauge factor (GF) and sensor thickness (Z). Due to soft lithography microfabrication and design methods the disclosed curvature sensors are elastically soft (modulus 0.1-1 MPa) and stretchable (100-1000% strain). In contrast to existing curvature sensors that measure differential strain, embodiments of the present invention measures curvature directly and allows for arbitrary gauge factor and film thickness. Moreover, the sensor is composed entirely of soft elastomer (PDMS or EcoflexÂ® and conductive liquid (eutectic gallium indium, (eGaIn)) and thus remains functional even when stretched to several times its natural length. Electrical resistance in the embedded eGaIn microchannel is measured as a function of bending curvature for a variety of sensor designs.",[Carmel Majidi][Rebecca K. Kramer][Robert J.

13669316,20131128,20130318020,ANALOG PROGRAMMABLE SPARSE APPROXIMATION SYSTEM,"A system and device for solving sparse algorithms using hardware solutions is described. The hardware solution can comprise one or more analog devices for providing fast, energy efficient solutions to small, medium, and large sparse approximation problems. The system can comprise sub-threshold current mode circuits on a Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) or on a custom analog chip. The system can comprise a plurality of floating gates for solving linear portions of a sparse signal. The system can also comprise one or more analog devices for solving non-linear portions of sparse signal.",[Samuel SHAPERO][Jennifer O.

13837702,20131128,20130318092,Method and System for Efficient Large-Scale Social Search,"To answer search queries on a social network rich with user-generated content, it is desirable to give a higher ranking to content that is closer to the individual issuing the query. Queries occur at nodes in the network, documents are also created by nodes in the same network, and a goal is to find the document that matches the query and is closest in network distance to the node issuing the query. Embodiments of the present invention provide solutions to this problem. After a some offline pre-processing, the system according to an embodiment of the present invention allows for social index operations (e.g., social search queries and insertion and deletion of words into and from a document at any node).",[Goel Ashish][Bahmani Bahman],"[The Board of Trustees for the Leland Stanford, Junior, University]","This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/652,106 filed May 25, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.",20130315,This invention was made with Government support under contracts 0904325 and 0915040 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

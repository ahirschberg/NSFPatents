11697060,20071025,20070247173,RESONANCE-INDUCED SENSITIVITY ENHANCEMENT METHOD FOR CONDUCTIVITY SENSORS,"Methods and systems for improving the sensitivity of a variety of conductivity sensing devices, in particular capacitively-coupled contactless conductivity detectors. A parallel inductor is added to the conductivity sensor. The sensor with the parallel inductor is operated at a resonant frequency of the equivalent circuit model. At the resonant frequency, parasitic capacitances that are either in series or in parallel with the conductance (and possibly a series resistance) is substantially removed from the equivalent circuit, leaving a purely resistive impedance. An appreciably higher sensor sensitivity results. Experimental verification shows that sensitivity improvements of the order of 10,000-fold are possible. Examples of detecting particulates with high precision by application of the apparatus and methods of operation are described.

They are synthesized by controlling solvent removal rates across material interfaces, in conjunction with the rates of surfactant self-assembly and inorganic cross-linking and surface interactions. A method for controlling the rates and directions of solvent removal from a heterogeneous material synthesis mixture that allows the nucleation and directional alignment of self-assembling mesostructures to be controlled during synthesis is disclosed. The aligned mesostructured inorganic-organic materials and mesoporous inorganic or carbon materials can be prepared in the form of patterned films, monoliths, and fibers with controllable orientational ordering. Such materials possess anisotropic structural, mechanical, optical, reaction, or transport properties that can be exploited for numerous applications in opto-electronics, separations, fuel cells, catalysis, MEMS/microfluidics, for example.

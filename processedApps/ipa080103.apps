11835818,20080103,20080000949,Method of Joining Using Reactive Multilayer Foils With Enhanced Control of Molten Joining Materials,"In accordance with the invention, bodies of materials are joined by disposing between them a reactive multilayer foil and one or more layers of meltable joining material such as braze or solder. The bodies are pressed together against the foil and joining material, and the foil is ignited to melt the joining material. The pressing is near the critical pressure and typically produces a joint having a strength of at least 70-85% the maximum strength producible at practical maximum pressures. Thus for example, reactively formed stainless steel soldered joints that were heretofore made at an applied pressure of about 100 MPa can be made with substantially the same strength at a critical applied pressure of about 10 kPa. Advantages of the process include minimization of braze or solder extrusion and reduced equipment and processing costs, especially in the joining of large bodies.

The aspects of the invention are achieved by a liquid crystal device comprising an orthogonal nematic, smectic or columnar liquid crystal phase, which is uniaxial in absence of electric field, but becomes biaxial when electric field is applied normal to the director (in between electrodes for planar alignment, or in-plane electric field in case of homeotropic alignment). This electric field induced biaxiality (EFIB) mode is provided using any dielectric orthogonal nematic, smectic or columnar bent-core liquid crystal phase. The nature of the switching is dielectric (not piezoelectric) and does not involve variation of layer spacing variation, so as to be mechanically much more stable than prior systems. The high switching speed combined with a large change in the effective birefringence and constant optical axis of the liquid crystal materials provide useful features in various applications, such as liquid crystal television, beam steering, spatial light modulators, and a variety of other applications.",[Antal I.

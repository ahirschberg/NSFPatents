The electrode has an electrical conductivity of at least 600 S/cm and a transmittance for 550 nm light of at least 80%. An average thickness of the network of carbon nanotubes is at least 2 nm. A method of producing a device according to an embodiment of this invention includes forming a film of carbon nanotubes on a filter surface by vacuum filtration, pressing a stamp against at least a portion of the film of carbon nanotubes to cause a portion of the film of carbon nanotubes to adhere to the stamp, and pressing the stamp having the portion of carbon nanotubes adhered thereto against a substructure of the device to cause the network of carbon nanotubes to be transferred to a surface of the substructure upon removal of the stamp.

11382213,20070531,20070121506,EFFICIENT LOSS RECOVERY ARCHITECTURE FOR LOSS-DECOUPLED TCP,"The invention provides a method and apparatus for decoupling loss recovery from congestion and window control. The system provides improved performance in high loss environments such as wireless links. The system avoids unnecessary window adjustment in response to packet losses. Transmission rates can be maintained with out compromising loss recovery. The invention uses just-in-time Packet Expiration, Transmission Order Queue, a Forward Retransmission Algorithm and Window Control to provide improved performance. The invention maintains a queue of packets in flight called the Transmission Order Queue (TOQ). When an acknowledgement is received for a packet in the in-flight queue, that packet is removed from the queue. If a packet is still in the queue for a certain threshold time, the invention assumes that it is lost. At that point, the packet is removed from the in-flight queue and the packet is retransmitted.

The resist film () includes a copolymer consisting of an organosilicone component and an organic component. An article () includes a substrate () and the resist film () disposed on the substrate (). The copolymer of the organosilicone component and the organic component is sufficiently elastic, due to the presence of the organosilicone component, to be capable of resisting fracture and delamination during mold release. Furthermore, during pattern formation, the copolymer develops relatively low surface energy at an interface with the surface of a mold, as compared to conventional polymeric materials, and preferentially adheres to the substrate () rather than the mold, which provides for relatively easy mold release. The presence of the organosilicone component in the copolymer also allows the resist film () to exhibit excellent resistance to oxygen plasma etching.

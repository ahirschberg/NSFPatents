These fluidic devices are analogous to electronic integrated circuits fabricated using large scale integration (LSI). A component of these networks is the fluidic multiplexor, which is a combinatorial array of binary valve patterns that exponentially increases the processing power of a network by allowing complex fluid manipulations with a minimal number of inputs. These integrated microfluidic networks can be used to construct a variety of highly complex microfluidic devices, for example the microfluidic analog of a comparator array, and a microfluidic memory storage device resembling electronic random access memories.",[Sebastian J.

Lipids and pore forming templates are dissolved into a first solution. The solvent is removed thereby creating a lipid bilayer with pore forming templates dispersed throughout. The bilayer is hydrated and monomers and crosslinkers are added to create a second solution. A nanothin film with pore forming templates is created through polymerization of said second solution. The pore forming templates are dissolved into a third solution by addition of a chemical in which the pore forming template is soluble, but the lipid bilayer is insoluble. This third solution is separated from the mixture leaving a nanothin polymer film with pores of a uniform thickness and surface area.

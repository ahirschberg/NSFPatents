The passage of biomolecules through the nanofilter is a function of both steric and electrostatic interactions between charged macromolecules and charged nanofilter walls, Continuous-flow separation through the devices of this invention are applicable for molecules varying in terms of any molecular properties (e.g., size, charge density or hydrophobicity) that can lead to differential transport across the nanofilters.

11510269,20070426,20070091975,Mounting system for optical frequency reference cavities,"A technique for reducing the vibration sensitivity of laser-stabilizing optical reference cavities is based upon an improved design and mounting method for the cavity, wherein the cavity is mounted vertically. It is suspended at one plane, around the spacer cylinder, equidistant from the mirror ends of the cavity. The suspension element is a collar of an extremely low thermal expansion coefficient material, which surrounds the spacer cylinder and contacts it uniformly. Once the collar has been properly located, it is cemented in place so that the spacer cylinder is uniformly supported and does not have to be squeezed at all. The collar also includes a number of cavities partially bored into its lower flat surface, around the axial bore. These cavities are support points, into which mounting base pins will be inserted. Hence the collar is supported at a minimum of three points.

11825682,20071122,20070267334,System and method for dissolving gases in liquids,"Apparatus and methods for dissolving a gas into a liquid comprises a saturation tank, a high pressure liquid pump in fluid communication with the tank, and a pressurized gas source in communication with a regulated gas head space of the saturation tank. The saturation tank comprises a pressure vessel for containing the liquid and has a regulated gas head space above the liquid, contains at least one liquid spray nozzle that permits passage of liquid into the pressure vessel, and an outlet for the liquid containing dissolved gas. Upon passing the gas-containing liquid into a second fluid, the gas is released in the form of microbubbles. The microbubbles aid in flocculation of suspended particles and promote dissolution of the gas in the second fluid. Preferred gases for use with the apparatus are oxygen, air, and ozone. Anticipated uses include treatment of rivers, streams, and ponds in natural or industrial settings, as well as smaller scale applications.

The approach is disclosed in regard to its applicability in connection with a recently developed microarchitecture called “WaveScalar.” WaveScalar is a compiler that breaks a control flow graph for a program into pieces called waves having instructions that are partially ordered (i.e., a wave contains no back-edges), and for which control enters at a single point. Certain aspects of the present approach are also generally applicable to executing multiple threads on a more conventional microarchitecture. In one aspect of this approach, instructions are provided that enable and disable wave-ordered memory. Additional memory access instructions bypass wave-ordered memory, exposing additional parallelism. Also, a lightweight, interthread synchronization is employed that models hardware queue locks. Finally, a simple fence instruction is used to allow applications to handle relaxed memory consistency.

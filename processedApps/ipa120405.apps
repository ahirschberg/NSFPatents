11983506,20120405,20120081119,TRANSMISSION LINE PROBE FOR NMR,"A probe for an NMR device is disclosed in which a saddle coil is disposed on one side of a flexible insulating material, and an additional conductor is disposed on the opposite side. The additional conductor and the conductors of the saddle coil create a capacitance across the insulating material. This capacitance acts with the inductance of the saddle coil such that the probe itself forms a transmission line. The probe is thus inherently broadband and requires no tuning. It also presents a constant impedance, thus facilitating impedance matching to an NMR spectrometer. In a preferred embodiment, a chip resistor is disposed on the flexible insulating material, terminating the transmission line.","","","",20071110,The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of PHY-0457039 awarded by the National Science Foundation.,"","","",""

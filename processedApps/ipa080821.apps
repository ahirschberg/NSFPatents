Movement of the ram causes movement of the nanolever relative to the substrate. The substrate and nanolever preferably comprise multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and the atom reservoir and nanoparticle ram are preferably metal (e.g. indium) deposited as small particles on the MWNTs. The substrate may comprise a silicon chip that has been fabricated to provide the necessary electrodes and other electromechanical structures, and further supports an atomic track, which may comprise an MWNT.",[Brian Christopher Regan][Alexander K.

By appropriately controlling the gas-phase environment self-limiting deposition at controllable rates (˜1 Å/pulse) was obtained. The process was insensitive to substrate temperature, with a constant deposition rate observed from 90-350° C. As-deposited TaOfilms under these conditions displayed good dielectric properties. Performance improvements correlate strongly with film density and composition as measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Pulsed PECVD eliminates the need for gas actuation and inert purge steps required by atomic layer deposition.",[Colin Wolden][Michael T.

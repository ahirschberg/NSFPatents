In an example, polyurea aerogels are prepared by mixing an triisocyanate with water and a triethylamine to form a sol-gel material and supercritically drying the sol-gel material to form the polyurea aerogel. Subjecting the polyurea aerogel to a step of pyrolysis may result in a three dimensional network having a carbon skeleton, yielding a carbon aerogel. The density and morphology of polyurea aerogels can be controlled by varying the amount of isocyanate monomer in the initial reaction mixture. A lower density in the aerogel gives rise to a fibrous morphology, whereas a greater density in the aerogel results in a particulate morphology. Polyurea aerogels described herein may also exhibit a reduced flammability.","","[Aerogel Technologies, LLC.]","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

Chemical analysis of the plugs remains a challenge. It has been discovered that nanoliter plugs of sample separated by air or oil can be analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry when pumped directly into a fused silica nanospray emitter nozzle. Using leu-enkephalin in methanol and 1% acetic acid in water (50:50 v:v) as a model sample, we found carry-over between plugs was &lt;0.1% and relative standard deviation of signal for a series of plugs was 3%. Detection limits were 1 nM. Sample analysis rates of 0.8 Hz were achieved by pumping 13 nL samples separated by 3 mm long air gaps in a 75 μm inner diameter tube. Analysis rates were limited by the scan time of the ion trap mass spectrometer. The system provides a robust, rapid, and information-rich method for chemical analysis of sample in segmented flow systems.","","[THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN][NEW OBJECTIVE, INC.][MILESTONE DEVELOPEMENT SERVICES]","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/218,454, filed on Jun. 19, 2009.

12968446,20120621,20120154206,CALIBRATION TECHNIQUE FOR PHASED ARRAY ANTENNAS,"A method for calibrating a phased-array antenna that involves transmitting a signal from a transmitting element, and sequentially receiving the transmitted signal at two receiving elements each spaced a first distance from the transmitting element. This step is then repeated one or more times, but transmitting from a different transmitting element in each repetition of the step, until each element being calibrated has received at least one transmission. Then, the first distance is changed to a second distance, and the steps are repeated one or more times to gather additional measurements. These measurements allow the determination from the received signals of two separate element mutual coupling ratios, one ratio for one subset of the elements being calibrated and the other for a second subset comprising the remaining elements being calibrated. Next, at least four additional transmissions and receptions are made via two transmissions each from two transmitting elements comprising one element of each subset, and the reception of transmissions from each of these two transmitting elements by each of two receiving elements, the two receiving elements being different elements than the two transmitting elements. From these last measurements a complex calibration ratio for all of the elements being calibrated with respect to a single element is determined. For calibration in the transmit mode, this same procedure is followed, but the transmissions become receptions and the receptions become transmissions.","",[University of Massachusetts Amherst],"",20101215,This invention was made with government support under grant number EEC-0313747 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

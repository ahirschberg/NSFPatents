The first layer includes a first surface across which an analyte in a sample can be transported and a second surface generally opposite of the first surface. The first layer satisfies the formula l≦(σDRT/|z|FV), where l is effective thickness of the first layer, Dis a diffusion coefficient of an analyte in the membrane phase, R is molar gas constant, T is temperature, zis a charge of an analyte or ion-analyte complex, F is faraday constant, v is a rate of a potential sweep during a stripping process and σ is no greater than 10. The working electrode also includes a second layer in contact with the second surface of first layer. The second layer is adapted to undergo at least one of a reduction reaction or an oxidization reaction. The working electrode further includes a support including a solid electrically conductive material in electrical connection with the second layer. The solid electrically conductive material can, for example, include a metal such as gold, platinum etc. or a conductive carbon.",[SHIGERU AMEMIYA][YUSHIN KIM],"","The present invention claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

11915308,20091112,20090280251,Mitigation of Biomolecular Adsorption with Hydrophilic Polymer Additives,"Molecular adsorption to the microfluidic device surfaces can be passively and actively mitigated by mixing certain hydrophilic polymers (organic polymers with repeating hydrophilic groups—the preferred polymers being amphipathic surfactants—with the sample liquid during or prior to relevant microfluidic operations. Nonionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate and polyoxyethylene octyl phenyl ether are especially effective. High molecular weight polyethylene polymers are also effective. The hydrophilic polymers appear to prevent binding of the fouling molecules to the microfluidic by occupying the surface sites in place of the fouling molecules or by interacting with the fouling molecules to prevent binding of the fouling molecules the surface. When surface adsorption is thus mitigated, microfluidic devices can readily handle samples containing biomolecules to enable active sample concentration, filtering, washing, transport, mixing and other sample handling operations.",[Peter-Patrick De Guzman][Wayne Po-Wen Liu][Brandon Uichong Yi],"[Core-Microsolutions, Inc]","The present applications claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60/683,476 file on May 21, 2005; the contents of which are incorporated by reference to the extent permitted by law.",20060518,"Portions of the work described herein was supported by Small Business Innovation Research (NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I Award No. DMI-0320082) funded by the Department of Homeland Security, and the government of the United States of America may retain certain rights to this patent.","","",20071121,PCT/US06/19425

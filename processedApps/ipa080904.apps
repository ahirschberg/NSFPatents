11832309,20080904,20080210662,THICK POROUS ANODIC ALUMINA FILMS AND NANOWIRE ARRAYS GROWN ON A SOLID SUBSTRATE,"The presently disclosed invention provides for the fabrication of porous anodic alumina (PAA) films on a wide variety of substrates. The substrate comprises a wafer layer and may further include an adhesion layer deposited on the wafer layer. An anodic alumina template is formed on the substrate. When a rigid substrate such as Si is used, the resulting anodic alumina film is more tractable, easily grown on extensive areas in a uniform manner, and manipulated without danger of cracking. The substrate can be manipulated to obtain free-standing alumina templates of high optical quality and substantially flat surfaces. PAA films can also be grown this way on patterned and non-planar surfaces. Furthermore, under certain conditions the resulting PAA is missing the barrier layer (partially or completely) and the bottom of the pores can be readily accessed electrically. The resultant film can be used as a template for forming an array of nanowires wherein the nanowires are deposited electrochemically into the pores of the template. By patterning the electrically conducting adhesion layer, pores in different areas of the template can be addressed independently, and can be filled electrochemically by different materials. Single-stage and multi-stage nanowire-based thermoelectric devices, consisting of both n-type and p-type nanowires, can be assembled on a silicon substrate by this method.",[Oded Rabin][Paul R.

The five-membered ring subunits, which are identifiable by infrared spectroscopy, impart unprecedented acidity to the mesostructure, as judged by cumene cracking activity at 300° C. Most notably, MSU-Z aluminosilicate made through the base hydrolysis of ZSM-5 in the presence of cetyl trimethyl ammonium ions exhibits a cumene conversion of 73%, which is 6.7-fold higher than the conversion provided by a conventional MCM-41. This approach to stabilizing zeolitic subunits through surfactant-mediated hydrolysis of zeolites appears to be general. The hydrolysis of USY zeolite under analogous hydrolytic conditions also affords zeolitic fragments that boost the acidity of the mesostructure in comparison to equivalent compositions prepared from conventional aluminosilicate precursors.",[Thomas J.

The method applies the masking threshold to the data sequence to produce masked data sequence and inserts the masked data sequence in the audio signal to produce an embedded audio signal.

The experimental results show that this technique can be used to perform matching based on local model structure. Scale-space techniques can be parameterized to generate decompositions that correspond to manufacturing, assembly or surface features relevant to mechanical design. One application of these techniques is to support matching and content-based retrieval of solid models. Scale-space technique can extract features that are invariant with respect to the global structure of the model as well as small perturbations that D laser scanning may introduce. A new distance function defined on triangles instead of points is introduced. This technique offers a new way to control the feature decomposition process, which results in extraction of features that are more meaningful from an engineering viewpoint. The technique is computationally practical for use in indexing large models.",[WILLIAM C.

12527889,20100204,20100024879,TITANIA NANOTUBES PREPARED BY ANODIZATION IN CHLORIDE-CONTAINING ELECTROLYTES,"A method of preparing titania nanotubes involves anodization of titanium in the presence of chloride ions and at low pH (1-7) in the absence of fluoride. The method leads to rapid production of titania nanotubes of about 25 nm diameter and high aspect ratio. The nanotubes can be organized into bundles and tightly packed parallel arrays. Inclusion of organic acids in the electrolyte solution leads to the incorporation into the nanotubes of up to 50 atom percent of carbon. In a two-stage method, a titanium anode is pre-patterned using a fluoride ion containing electrolyte and subsequently anodized in a chloride ion containing electrolyte to provide more evenly distributed nanotube arrays. The titania nanotubes have uses in composite materials, solar cells, hydrogen production, and as hydrogen sensors.",[Christiaan Richter][Latika Menon][Ronald J.

The first codon is in the first polynucleotide at a first frequency relative to other synonymous codons, and is in the second polynucleotide at a second frequency relative to other synonymous codons. The first and second frequencies are different. Each polynucleotide is individually expressed in the expression system to measure an expression property value of the polynucleotides, thereby determining a property that affects expression of polynucleotides. The property is an effect that a frequency of use of one or more codons has on expression of polynucleotides in the expression system.",[Mark Welch][Claes Gustafsson],"","",20080731,The research described in this application was funded in part by NSF SBIR grant 0638333.,"","","",""

11507181,20070301,20070047888,Capped low loss polymer waveguide and method of making same,"Disclosed are guided optical devices comprising capped polymer ridged waveguides and methods of fabrication. An exemplary waveguide has a core with a cap (CapClad), bottom cladding and side cladding. The core is patterned together with cap to form the waveguide. The cap protects the core during processing after the core is coated and dried, and the cap layer is coated. Dust particles, contamination, mechanical damage, and process-induced defects on the top surface of the core are eliminated so that waveguide loss is minimized. Propagation loss measurements for reduced-to-practice embodiments have shown a 20% improvement of the capped waveguide over existing waveguides. The manufacturing yield of optical polymer waveguides and waveguide-based polymer devices is expected to be increase.

AtCel5 is believed to be a soluble and secreted protein that plays a role in the sloughing of root cap cells from the root tip. The sloughing of root cap cells from the root tip is important because it assists the growing root in penetrating the soil. The AtCel5 gene promotor provides a new molecular marker to further analyze the process of root cap cell separation and also provides a root cap specific promoter for targeting to the environment genes with beneficial properties for plant growth. ,[Elena Campillo][Damian Crawford],"","",20050901, This invention was made with government support under Contract Number 2001-35304-10088 awarded by the United States Department of Agriculture and NSF-IPB 9817983.

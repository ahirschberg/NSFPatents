The CP model factors deformations of the body into three components: shape variation, viewpoint change and pose variation. The CP model can be “dressed” with a low-dimensional clothing model. The clothing is represented as a deformation from the underlying CP representation. This deformation is learned from training examples using principal component analysis to produce so-called eigen-clothing.

The application program can then access the storage device without the operating system's intervention and the storage device will check whether the application has permission to access the data. As a result, in most cases, neither the operating system nor the file system needs to be invoked, and since both of them increase the amount of time required to access the data in the file system, considerable performance improvements are possible.",[Steven Swanson][Adrian Caulfield][Todor Mollov],[THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA],"This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

These trends have contributed to the availability of large databases of photographs. Effectively organizing, browsing, and visualizing such .scas. of images, as well as finding a particular image, can be difficult tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that knowledge of where images were taken and where they were pointed makes it possible to visualize large sets of photographs in powerful, intuitive new ways. We present and evaluate a set of novel tools that use location and orientation information, derived semi-automatically using structure from motion, to enhance the experience of exploring such large collections of images.",[Keith Noah Snavely][Steven Maxwell Seitz][Richard Szeliski],[University of Washington][Microsoft Corporation],"The instant application is a continuation application of, and claims priority to, U.S. patent application Ser.

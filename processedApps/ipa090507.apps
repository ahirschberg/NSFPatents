The sensors are designed in AMI 1.5 μm 2 metal, 2 poly process. A unique maskless post processing sequence is designed and completed. The three post-processing steps are fully compatible with any CMOS technology. This allows any signal control/processing circuitry to be easily integrated on the same chip. ZnO is used as the piezoelectric material for the SAW generation. A thorough characterization and patterning optimization of the sputtered ZnO was carried out. The major novelties that are introduced in the SAW delay line features are: The embedded heater elements for temperature control, compensation and acoustic absorbers that are designed to eliminate edge reflections and minimize triple transit interference. Both of these attributes are designed by using the CMOS layers without disturbing the SAW performance.",[Onur Tigli][Mona Zaghloul],"","This application is a continuation-in-part application and claims priority benefit of the earlier filing date under 35 USC 120 of U.S. patent application Ser.

This new class of actuators utilizes the liquid dielectric for hydraulic amplification and force transfer.

One chamber is compressed by pulling down a flexible membrane using electrostatic actuation, thus forcing the liquid under it to transfer into the other chamber. Such movement causes the other chamber's membrane to expand out of plane.",[Khalil Najafi][Hanseup Kim],"","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/997,768, filed on Oct. 8, 2007.

11664655,20090507,20090117545,"Glycine riboswitches, methods for their use, and compositions for use with glycine riboswitches Cross-Reference to Related Applications","It has been discovered that certain natural mRNAs serve as metabolite-sensitive genetic switches wherein the RNA directly binds a small organic molecule. This binding process changes the conformation of the mRNA, which causes a change in gene expression by a variety of different mechanisms. Modified versions of these natural “riboswitches” (created by using various nucleic acid engineering strategies) can be employed as designer genetic switches that are controlled by specific effector compounds. Such effector compounds that activate a riboswitch are referred to herein as trigger molecules. The natural switches are targets for antibiotics and other small molecule therapies. In addition, the architecture of riboswitches allows actual pieces of the natural switches to be used to construct new non-immunogenic genetic control elements, for example the aptamer (molecular recognition) domain can be swapped with other non-natural aptamers (or otherwise modified) such that the new recognition domain causes genetic modulation with user-defined effector compounds. The changed switches become part of a therapy regimen-turning on, or off, or regulating protein synthesis. Newly constructed genetic regulation networks can be applied in such areas as living biosensors, metabolic engineering of organisms, and in advanced forms of gene therapy treatments.",[Ronald R.

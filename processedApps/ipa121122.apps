The model is applicable to relational data with various structures. Under this model, a spectral relational clustering algorithm is provided to cluster multiple types of interrelated data objects simultaneously. The algorithm iteratively embeds each type of data objects into low dimensional spaces and benefits from the interactions among the hidden structures of different types of data objects.","",[The Research Foundation of State University of New York],"The present application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

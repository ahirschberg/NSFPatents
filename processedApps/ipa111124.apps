The target secondary structure is decomposed into a binary tree and candidate mutations are evaluated on leaf nodes of the tree. During a process of leaf optimization, defect-weighted mutation sampling is used to select each candidate mutation position with a probability proportional to its contribution to an ensemble defect of the leaf. Subsequences of the tree are then merged, moving up the tree until a final nucleotide sequence of interest is determined that has the target secondary structure at equilibrium.",[Niles A.

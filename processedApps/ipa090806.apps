11382811,20090806,20090193851,CORE SUCTION TECHNIQUE FOR THE FABRICATION OF OPTICAL FIBER PREFORMS,"Optical fiber preforms which can be drawn into optical fibers of desired dimensions are fabricated by applying a vacuum to a cladding tube and drawing molten glass from a crucible into a bore of the cladding tube while a portion of the cladding tube is within a furnace preferably through a small hole in the top of the furnace. The method and apparatus are particularly applicable to highly non-linear fiber (HNLF) glasses and highly doped or rare earth glasses since materials therein are generally expensive and only a small quantity of molten glass is required but can be applied to virtually any optical fiber construction where the core glass has a lower melting or softening point than that of the cladding tube. Sources of contamination, breakage and other preform defects are substantially avoided and toxic substances, if present are readily confined.",[Nitin Kumar Goel][Rogers H. Stolen][Steven H.

AFeOnanoparticles, e.g., with metal ratio from x=0.4 to 1.0, can be prepared according to standard solution micelle techniques. While the materials produced by micelle synthesis, such as CoFeOnanoparticles, appeared to be comprised of mainly the magnetite phase (e.g., CoFeO) by x-ray diffraction, multiphase materials were observed after the transition metal ferrite nanoparticles were subjected to thermal treatment under nitrogen. Magnetization as a function of applied field and temperature reveal variations in saturation magnetization, coercivity, blocking temperature and Verwey transition temperature dependence as a function of composition. Extremely high saturation magnetization with low coercivity can be achieved with such compositions.",[Douglas L. Schulz][Robert A. Sailer][Anthony N.

An analysis phase can be included where the relationship between motion capture markers and detailed facial geometry is inferred. A synthesis phase can be included where detailed animated facial geometry is driven by a sparse set of motion capture markers. For analysis, an actor can be recorded wearing facial markers while performing a set of training expression clips. Real-time high-resolution facial deformations are captured, including dynamic wrinkle and pore detail, using interleaved structured light 3D scanning and photometric stereo. Next, displacements are calculated between a neutral mesh driven by the motion capture markers and the high-resolution captured expressions. These geometric displacements are stored in one or more polynomial displacement maps parameterized according to the local deformations of the motion capture dots. For synthesis, the polynomial displacement maps can be driven with new motion capture data.",[Paul E.

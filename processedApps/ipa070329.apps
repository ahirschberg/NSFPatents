A contour of that object is extracted from the image and normalized. Based on the normalized contour, one or more summation invariant values are determined and compared to templates comprising one or more summation invariants for each of one or more target objects. The determined summation invariants for the extracted object are compared to summation invariants for the target objects. When the summation invariants for the extracted object sufficiently match the summation invariants determined from an image of a target object, the extracted object is recognized as that target object. The summation invariants can be semi-local summation invariants determined for each point along the normalized contour, based on a number of points neighboring that point on the normalized contour. The semi-local summation invariants are determined as a function of the x and y coordinates of those points.

Such defunctionalization largely comprises the removal of sidewall functionality from the CNTs, but can also serve to remove functionality from the CNT ends. Such methods facilitate the resuspension of such defunctionalized CNTs in various solvents and permit the defunctionalization of functionalized CNTs that would normally decompose (or partially decompose) upon thermal treatment. Such methods of defunctionalization can typically lead to defunctionalized CNTs that are essentially pristine (or nearly pristine), and which, in contrast to prior art methods of thermal defunctionalization, can be easily resuspended in a variety of solvents.

When a long-latency load reaches the retirement stage unresolved, the processor enters Clear mode by (1) taking a Checkpoint of the architectural registers, (2) supplying a load-value prediction to consumers, and (3) early-retiring the long-latency load. This unclogs retirement, thereby “clearing the way” for subsequent instructions to retire, and also allowing instructions dependent on the long-latency load to execute sooner. When the actual value returns from memory, it is compared against the prediction. A misprediction causes the processor to roll back to the checkpoint, discarding all subsequent computation.

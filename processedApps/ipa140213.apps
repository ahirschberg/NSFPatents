Control over changed solution conditions may result from a variety of techniques, including but not limited to metering volumes of crystallizing agent into the chamber by volume exclusion, by entrapment of volumes of crystallizing agent determined by the dimensions of the microfabricated structure, or by cross-channel injection of sample and crystallizing agent into an array of junctions defined by intersecting orthogonal flow channels.",[Carl L.

Existing approaches for k NN search in spatial networks assume that the weight of each edge in the spatial network is constant. However, real-world edge-weights are time-dependent and vary significantly in short durations, hence invalidating the existing solutions. The problem of k NN search in time-dependent spatial networks, where the weight of each edge is a function of time, is addressed herein. Two indexing schemes (Tight Network Index and Loose Network Index) are proposed to minimize the number of candidate nearest neighbor objects and reduce the invocation of the expensive fastest-path computation in time-dependent spatial networks.

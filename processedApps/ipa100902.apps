The composition is generally a solution comprised of a positively or negatively charged peptide-amphiphile and a like signed ion from the mineral. Mixing this solution with a second solution containing a dissolved counter-ion of the mineral and/or a second oppositely charged peptide amphiphile, results in the rapid self assembly of the peptide-amphiphiles into a nanofiber gel and templated mineralization of the ions. Templated mineralization of the initially dissolved mineral cations and anions in the mixture occurs with preferential orientation of the mineral crystals along the fiber surfaces within the nanofiber gel. One advantage of the present invention is that it results in homogenous growth of the mineral throughout the nanofiber gel. Another advantage of the present invention is that the nanofiber gel formation and mineralization reactions occur in a single mixing step and under substantially neutral or physiological pH conditions.

The apparatus uses collection surfaces designed to manipulate or change the electrostatic field so that the electrospun fibers are arranged in desirable patterns that are similar to or mimic the fibrillar structure of an animal tissue. The manipulation results in fibers that are preferentially oriented in a predefined pattern. In addition, the interfiber space between the fibers and the fiber diameter are consistently within a predefined range. Using these techniques in conjunction with controlling polymer properties enables the production of a scaffold that has the structural and mechanical characteristics similar to the native tissue.",[Stuart B.

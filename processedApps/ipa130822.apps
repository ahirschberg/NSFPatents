In one set of embodiments, droplets may be sorted using surface acoustic waves. The droplets may contain cells or other species. In some cases, the surface acoustic waves may be created using a surface acoustic wave generator such as an interdigitated transducer, and/or a material such as a piezoelectric substrate. The piezoelectric substrate may be isolated from the microfluidic substrate except at or proximate the location where the droplets are sorted, e.g., into first or second microfluidic channels. At such locations, the microfluidic substrate may be coupled to the piezoelectric substrate (or other material) by one or more coupling regions. In some cases, relatively high sorting rates may be achieved, e.g., at rates of at least about 1,000 Hz, at least about 10,000 Hz, or at least about 100,000 Hz, and in some embodiments, with high cell viability after sorting.",[David A.

The method includes randomly grouping a data set of objects into geographically contiguous districts, optimizing the objects by iteratively moving one or more objects between neighboring districts, wherein a relationship of objects is analyzed in each district to determine a minimal set of objects that will move together to maintain contiguity between districts, and generating one or more solutions for the data set.",[Diansheng Guo],[UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA],"The present application is based on and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 61/601,162 having a filing date of Feb. 21, 2012, which is incorporated by reference herein.",20130221,This invention was made with government support under grant number BCS 0748813 awarded by National Science Foundation.

For example, data which comprises token-level time course data and type-level causal relationships can be obtained. In addition, a determination can be made as to whether the type-level causal relationships are instantiated in the token-level time course data, and using a computing arrangement. Further, exemplary significance scores for the causal relationships can be determined based on the determination procedure. It is also possible to determine probabilities associated with the type-level causal relationships using the token-level time course data and a probabilistic temporal model and/or type-level time course data when at least one of the type-level causal relationships have indeterminate truth values. The exemplary determination of the probabilities can be performed using a prior causal information inference procedure.",[Samantha Kleinberg][Bhubaneswar Mishra],[New York University],"The present application relates to and claims priority from U.S. Patent Application No. 61/306,529 filed Feb. 21, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.",20110220,"The present disclosure was developed, at least in part, using Government support from the National Science Foundation under CDI Grant Number 0836649.

13819136,20130822,20130219362,"DESIGN RULE HIERARCHY, TASK PARALLELISM, AND DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS IN LOGICAL DECISION MODELS","A binary augmented constraint network (BACN) allows dependency relationships to be determined without solving constraints. BACN models design decisions as first-class members and expresses how decisions make assumptions upon each other using logical constraints. Pairwise dependency relations (PWDRs) are determined based on the BACN. A design rule hierarchy (DRH) based on assumption relations among design decisions identifies parallelizable tasks within software design. Modules within the same layer of the hierarchy suggest concurrent tasks. Dependencies between layers or within a module suggest possible need for communication. In one configuration, decisions within the top layer of the hierarchy are the most influential design rules, which dominate the rest of the system, and are kept stable. The decisions within subsequent layers assume design decisions in previous layers. The design decisions within each layer are clustered into modules. Modules within the same layer are independent from each other and are candidates for concurrent implementation.",[Yuanfang Cai][Sunny Wong],[Drexel University],"The instant application claims benefit to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/378,007, entitled &#x201C;Improving the Efficiency Of Dependency Analysis In Logical Decision Models,&#x201D; filed Aug. 30, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

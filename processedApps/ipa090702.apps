The electroactive polymer (EAP) includes a sheet of an ion-exchange membrane having opposite surfaces on which are plated gold electrodes. The EAP is formed to have a dome-shape with a plurality of sensing electrodes circumferentially disposed around an outer surface of the dome. A flexible polymer underlying the EAP supports it and prevents a force applied to the tactile sensor from inverting the dome. The sensor electrodes produce separate output signals indicative of different vector components of an applied force acting on the tactile sensor, so that a direction of the force can be determined. Vias provided in the electrodes are electrically coupled to a flexible circuit that conveys the output signals externally from the sensing electrodes for use and further processing. A plurality of the tactile sensors can be formed as an array on an ion-exchange membrane.",[Minoru Taya][Jin Wang][Chunye Xu][Yasuo Kuga],[University of Washington],"This application is based on a prior copending provisional application, Ser.

Such techniques offload specific functionality to a NIC while maintaining the bulk of the protocol processing in the host operating system (“OS”). The resulting protocol implementation allows the application to bypass the protocol processing of the received data. Such can be accomplished this by moving data from the NIC directly to the application through direct memory access (“DMA”) and batch processing the receive headers in the host OS when the host OS is interrupted to perform other work. Batch processing receive headers allows the data path to be separated from the control path. Unlike operating system bypass, however, the operating system still fully manages the network resource and has relevant feedback about traffic and flows.

The measurement of spin parity allows for the determination of part of the states of the Fermions, which provides the states of the qubits, while keeping the undetermined part of the state coherent. The ability to know the parity of qubit states allows for logic operations to be performed on the qubits, i.e., allows for the formation of (two-qubit) quantum gates, which like classical logic gates, are the building blocks of a quantum computer.

A femtosecond driving pulse is focused into an HHG medium (such as a noble gas) to cause high-harmonic generation (HHG), for example in the X-ray region of the spectrum, via electrons separating from and recombining with gas atoms. A non-collinear pulse intersects the driving pulse within the gas, and modulates the field seen by the electrons while separated from their atoms. The modulating pulse is low power and long duration, and its frequency and amplitude is chosen to improve HHG phase matching by increasing the areas of constructive interference between the driving pulse and the HHG, relative to the areas of destructive interference.",[Oren Cohen][Henry C.

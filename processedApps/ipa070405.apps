Excessive pressure due to formation of a fibrous capsule and valve resistance is relieved by bypassing the valve element or by providing a secondary discharge port. Removal of resistance is enabled by physical manipulation, external stimulus, chemical action or biological action. A resistor inserted in an intake conduit provides a predetermined resistance to flow and thus, a desired intraocular pressure. ",[J.

12378103,20091015,20090255327,Broad-range nanoliter rheometer,"A nanoliter rheometer is capable of operating over a wide range of temperatures and permits visual observation of extremely small amounts of various often complex and/or expensive small nanoliter size fluids over a wide viscoelastic regime. The nanoliter rheometer comprises two very thin fibers, the ends of which are in close proximity to one another and desirably parallel to one another with one fiber being moved by a drive system and the remaining fiber desirably being stationary and capable of measuring a force transferred through a nanoliter size fluid located between the two fibers ends. The transferred force can be measured either by an LCR meter or a piezoelectric crystal and recorded as by a lock-in amplifier.",[Antal Istvan Jakli][Christopher Allen Bailey],[KENT STATE UNIVERSITY],"This patent application claims the benefit and priority of U.S. provisional application 61/066,184, filed Feb. 19, 2008 for BROAD-RANGE NANOLITER RHEOMETER, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.",20090211,The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention under the National Science Foundation FRG under Contract No. DMS-0456221.,"","","",""

The resin materials can include a radiation-curable silsesquioxane resin and a photo-initiator having low viscosity. The low viscosity of the liquid system allows imprinting with low pressure and low temperature; e.g. room temperature. The resist's dry etching resistance is increased and the cured film is more easily separated from the mask. Due to its high modulus after cure, the material allows the fabrication of micro- and nano-features having high aspect ratios while providing a high throughput. Various pattern sizes, for example, ranging from tens of microns to as small as a few nanometers, may be achieved with the UV-curable material system.",[Peng-Fei Fu][Lingjie Jay Guo],"","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/043,519, filed on Apr. 9, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.",20090409,This invention was made with government support under Grant No. ECS 0424204 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

In the presence of phospholipid, MSPs form nanoscopic phospholipid bilayer disks, with the MSP stabilizing the particle at the perimeter of the bilayer domain. The particle bilayer structure allows manipulation of incorporated proteins in solution or on solid supports, including for use with such surface-sensitive techniques as scanning probe microscopy or surface plasmon resonance. The nanoscale particles, which are robust in terms of integrity and maintenance of biological activity of incorporated proteins, facilitate pharmaceutical and biological research, structure/function correlations, structure determinations, bioseparations, and drug discovery.",[Stephen G.

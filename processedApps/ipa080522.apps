A chemically or biochemically active agent or fluid precursor also can be transferred from indentations in an applicator to a substrate surface. The substrate surface can be planar or non-planar. Fluid precursors of polymeric structures, inorganic ceramics and salts, and the like can be used to form patterned polymeric articles, inorganic salts and ceramics, reactive ion etch masks, etc. at the surface. The articles can be formed in a pattern including a portion having a lateral dimension of less than about 1 millimeter or smaller. The indentation pattern of the applicator can be used to transfer separate, distinct chemically or biochemically active agents or fluid precursors to separate, isolated regions of a substrate surface. Waveguide arrays, combinatorial chemical or biochemical libraris, etc. can be made. Differences in refractive index of waveguide and cladding can be created by subjecting the waveguide and cladding, made of identical prepolymeric material, to different polymerization or cross-linking conditions. Interferometers are defined by coupling arrays of waveguides, where coupling can be controlled by altering the difference in refractive index between cladding and waveguide at any desired location of the array. Alteration and refractive index can be created photochemically, chemically, or the like. Sensors also are disclosed, including biochemical sensors.

Compositions identified in accordance with the invention specifically inhibit the interaction between ribosomal protein L41 and the ribosomes thereby resulting in decreased peptidyltransferase activity of the ribosomes. Decreases in peptidyltransferase activity have been associated with increased −1 PRF efficiencies, which in turn interfere with self assembly of −1PRF dependent viruses thereby interfering with virus propagation.

11938040,20080522,20080120514,THERMAL MANAGEMENT OF ON-CHIP CACHES THROUGH POWER DENSITY MINIMIZATION,"Certain embodiments provide systems and methods for reducing power consumption in on-chip caches. Certain embodiments include Power Density-Minimized Architecture (PMA) and Block Permutation Scheme (BPS) for thermal management of on-chip caches. Instead of turning off entire banks, PMA architecture spreads out active parts in a cache bank by turning off alternating rows in a bank. This reduces the power density of the active parts in the cache, which then lowers the junction temperature. The drop in the temperature results in energy savings from the remaining active parts of the cache. BPS aims to maximize the physical distance between the logically consecutive blocks of the cache. Since there is spatial locality in caches, this distribution results in an increase in the distance between hot spots, thereby reducing the peak temperature. The drop in the peak temperature then results in a leakage power reduction in the cache.",[Yehea Ismail][Gokhan Memik][Ja Chun Ku][Serkan Ozdemir],"","This application is related to, and claims the benefit of, Provisional Application No. 60/865,272, filed on Nov. 10, 2006, and entitled &#x201C;Thermal Management of On-Chip Caches Through Power Density Minimization.&#x201D; The foregoing application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.",20071109,"This invention was made with government support under Grant No. CCF-0541337 awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Grant No. DE-FG02-05ER25691 awarded by the Department of Energy (DoE), and Northwestern Cufs Nos. 0830-350-J205 and 0680-350-FF02.

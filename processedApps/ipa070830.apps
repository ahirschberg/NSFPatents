The IFV is propelled through a pipeline, either by fluid flow or by self-propulsion. The IFV includes one or more vibration sensors, a power source, and electronic instrumentation that is programmed to records vibrations present in the fluid periodically as the IFV travels through the pipeline. Processed vibrations are periodically stored in the memory of the vehicle and subsequently transferred to a computer. The processed vibrations are analyzed to determine the location of the vibration energies emanating from any leaks present in the pipeline.

In one embodiment, a micromechanical oscillator has a resonant frequency defined by an effective spring constant that is modified by application of heat. In one embodiment, the oscillator is disc of material supported by a pillar of much smaller diameter than the disc. The periphery of the disc is heated to modify the resonant frequency (or equivalently the spring constant or stiffness) of the disc. Continuous control of the output phase and frequency may be achieved when the oscillator becomes synchronized with an imposed sinusoidal force of close frequency. The oscillator frequency can be detuned to produce an easily controlled phase differential between the injected signal and the oscillator feedback. A phased array radar may be produced using independent phase controllable oscillators.

Ultrafine nano-size cerium oxide particles, less than 10 nanometers in diameter, have been provided to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) in retina tissue that generates large amounts of ROS. These reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in light-induced retina degeneration and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Cerium oxide nanoparticles have been used to promote the lifespan of retinal neurons and protect the neurons from apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide in vitro and in vivo. The neuronal protection in retinal cells is achieved by decreasing generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS).

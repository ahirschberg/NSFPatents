Backside illumination of a thin gold film by pulsed laser radiation, pulsed ultraviolet xenon flashlamp, or like UV source, is used to produce bursts of low energy photo-emitted electrons. These swarms of thermalized electrons are directly attached by electronegative analytes or by reactant molecules, followed by charge transfer to the more electronegative analyte. Total internal reflection is incorporated for the backside illumination using optical elements such as a fused silica prism. The spectrometer allows for the direct vaporization of adsorbed explosive molecules from surfaces followed by direct injection into the photoemissive ion mobility spectrometer through a heated inlet.

11561087,20070524,20070114477,ENHANCED SENSITIVITY OF A WHISPERING GALLERY MODE MICROSPHERE SENSOR BY A HIGH-REFRACTIVE INDEX SURFACE LAYER,"The use of whispering gallery mode (WGM) evanescent waves to detect adsorption of molecules to the surface of microsphere sensors and more particularly to the utilization of a high refractive index surface layer to increase the sensitivity thereof. The present invention examines the sensor capability of WGM in a dielectric sphere coated with a thin uniform dielectric layer of a high refractive index. Among the utilities of such a modified resonator for the sensing are to have an evanescent field of a different penetration depth without using a non-silica based microsphere or changing the laser wavelength, to further enhance the sensitivity by drawing the optical field of WGM into the coating layer, and to realize the same relative shifts for WGM of different radial modes, thus eliminating ambiguities in the measurement of a refractive index change in the surrounding medium.

The charged single-wall carbon nanotubes, have been found to have spectral shifts in certain regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The charged single wall nanotubes are very sensitive to environmental perturbations and the nanotube's optical properties will be affected by these perturbations. Accordingly, the charged single wall carbon nanotubes can be used as sensors for a wide variety of applications, such as salt concentrations and pH, signal generators, measuring length of DNA molecules, as well as optical tags for biological detection and mapping of malignant cell activity. Optimal sensor devices are achieved in the present invention when the charged single-wall carbon nanotube carries a linear charge density close to that of DNA.

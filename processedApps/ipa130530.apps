By avoiding the use of solid or liquid reducing reagents, the gas reducing reagent can be used to make shape well-defined metal- and metal alloy-based nanoparticles without producing contaminates in solution. Therefore, the post-synthesis process including surface treatment become simple or unnecessary. Weak capping reagents can be used for preventing nanoparticles from aggregation, which makes the further removing the capping reagents easier. The selective gas-reducing technique represents a new concept for shape control of nanoparticles, which is based on the concepts of tuning the reducing rate of the different facets. This technique can be used to produce morphology-controlled nanoparticles from nanometer- to submicron- to micron-sized scale.

The epithelium was patterned into crypt-like SOX9-positive proliferative zones and villus-like structures with all of the major functional cell types of the intestine.

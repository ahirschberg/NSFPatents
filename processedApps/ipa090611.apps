With frequency domain power adaptation, the transmission power is allocated over the N′ (1≦N′≦N) strongest subcarriers rather than over all possible N subcarriers, where the strongest subcarriers are understood to exhibit the highest channel gains. A substantially optimal N′ can be chosen so that the average bit error rate (BER) is minimized. In the time domain power adaptation technique, transmission power is adapted so that the desired signal strength at the receiver output is maintained at a fixed level. In the combined time and frequency domain adaptation technique, the transmission power is first allocated over the N′ (1≦N′≦N) strongest subcarriers rather than over all possible N subcarriers and then it is adapted so that the desired signal strength at the receiver output is maintained at a fixed level.",[Yeheskel Bar-Ness][Ye-Hoon Lee],[New Jersey Institute of Technology],"This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

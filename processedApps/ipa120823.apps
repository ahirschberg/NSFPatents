13388596,20120823,20120211084,MULTIPLE EMULSIONS CREATED USING JETTING AND OTHER TECHNIQUES,"The present invention generally relates to emulsions, and more particularly, to multiple emulsions. In one aspect, multiple emulsions are formed by urging a fluid into a channel, e.g., by causing the fluid to enter the channel as a “jet.” Side channels can be used to encapsulate the fluid with a surrounding fluid. In some cases, multiple fluids may flow through a channel collinearly before multiple emulsion droplets are formed. The fluidic channels may also, in certain embodiments, include varying degrees of hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity. As examples, the fluidic channel may be relatively hydrophilic upstream of an intersection (or other region within the channel) and relatively hydrophobic downstream of the intersection, or vice versa. In some cases, the average cross-sectional dimension may change, e.g., at an intersection. For instance, the average cross-sectional dimension may increase at the intersection. Surprisingly, a relatively small increase in dimension, in combination with a change in hydrophilicity of the fluidic channel, may delay droplet formation of a stream of collinearly-flowing multiple fluids under certain flow conditions; accordingly, the point at which multiple emulsion droplets are formed can be readily controlled within the fluidic channel. In some cases, the multiple droplet may be formed from the collinear flow of fluids at (or near) a single location within the fluidic channel. In addition, unexpectedly, systems such as those described herein may be used to encapsulate fluids in single or multiple emulsions that are difficult or impossible to encapsulate using other techniques, such as fluids with low surface tension, viscous fluids, or viscoelastic fluids. Other aspects of the invention are generally directed to methods of making and using such systems, kits involving such systems, emulsions created using such systems, or the like.","",[President and Fellows of Harvard College],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

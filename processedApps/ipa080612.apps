The generator is preferably an electromagnetic, vibration-to-electrical power generator which can efficiently scavenge energy from low frequency external vibrations. The generator up-converts low frequency environmental vibrations to a much higher frequency through a mechanical frequency up-converter, and hence provides efficient energy conversion even at low frequencies. This mechanical frequency up-conversion process can be realized in a number of ways. A magnetic method is described as an example. After frequency up-conversion, voltage is induced on coils mounted on resonators by electromagnetic induction.

In this study it is shown that the microalga can be engineered to import glucose and grow in the dark through the introduction of genes encoding glucose transporters. Both the human and glucose transporters facilitated the uptake of glucose by , allowing the cells to metabolize exogenous organic carbon and thrive, independent of light. This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene. Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization. Finally, this work also represents critical progress toward large-scale commercial exploitation of obligate phototrophic algae through the use of microbial fermentation technology, eliminating significant limitations resulting from light-dependent growth.",[Kirk Emil Apt][F.C.

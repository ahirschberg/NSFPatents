Clutter rejection filters are provided and used to remove undesired components from the ODT signal, such as clutter induced by stationary scatterers (e.g., the relatively stationary tissue of a blood vessel wall).

Further, Doppler images obtained using the clutter rejection filter technique disclosed herein exhibit fewer background artifacts induced by the relative motion of stationary scatterers with respect to the scanning probe.

A spatial penalty term encourages sharp edges in the high-resolution image, the data fidelity penalty term is applied to space invariant point spread function, translational, affine, projective and dense motion models including fusing the lower-resolution images, to estimate a blurred higher-resolution image and then a deblurred image. The data fidelity penalty term uses the Lnorm in a likelihood fidelity term for motion estimation errors. The spatial penalty term uses bilateral-TV regularization with an image having horizontal and vertical pixel-shift terms, and a scalar weight between 0 and 1. The penalty terms create an overall cost function having steepest descent optimization applied for minimization. Direct image operator effects replace matrices for speed and efficiency.

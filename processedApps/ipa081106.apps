12041857,20081106,20080272181,METHOD FOR MAKING NANOSTRUCTURED SOLDERED OR BRAZED JOINTS WITH REACTIVE MULTILAYER FOILS,Self-propagating formation reactions in nanostructured multilayer foils provide rapid bursts of heat at room temperature and therefore can act as local heat sources to melt solder or braze layers and join materials. This reactive joining method provides very localized heating to the components and rapid cooling across the joint. The rapid cooling results in a very fine microstructure of the solder or braze material. The scale of the fine microstructure of the solder or braze material is dependant on cooling rate of the reactive joints which varies with geometries and properties of the foils and components. The microstructure of the solder or braze layer of the joints formed by melting solder in a furnace is much coarser due to the slow cooling rate. Reactive joints with finer solder or braze microstructure show higher shear strength compared with those made by conventional furnace joining with much coarser solder or braze microstructure. It is expected that the reactive joints may also have better fatigue properties compared with conventional furnace joints.,[Jiaping Wang][Etienne Besnoin][Omar Knio][Timothy Weihs],"","This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser.

11915736,20081106,20080272516,Successive Shrinking of Elastomers - a Simple Miniaturization Protocol to Produce Micro- and Nano-Structures,"A stepwise contraction and adsorption nanolithography (SCAN) patterning process can shrink complex microstructures (produced by current microfabrication technology) into the nanometer region. The basis of SCAN is to transfer a pre-engineered microstructure onto a extended elastomer. This extended elastomer is then allowed to relax, reducing the microstructure accordingly. The new miniaturized structure is then used as a stamp to transfer the structure onto another stretched elastomer. Through iterations of this procedure, patterns of materials with pre-designed geometry are miniaturized to the desired dimensions, including sub-100 ran. The simplicity and high throughput capability of SCAN make the platform a competitive alternative to other micro- and nanolithography techniques for potential applications in multiplexed sensors, non-binary optical displays, biochips, nanoelectronics devices, and microfluidic devices.",[Gang-Yu Liu][Jun Hu][Li Tan][Maozi Liu],[THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA],"This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/685,210, filed May 27, 2005, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.",20060530,This invention was made with Government support under Grant (or Contract) No. 60NANBID0072 from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and No. CHE 0244830 from the National Science Foundation.

13270700,20120419,20120096601,METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR NEAR-FIELD OPTICAL IMAGING,"A system and method for optically imaging a sample. The method and system uses a controlled scatterer of light positioned in the near field of a sample. The extinguished power from an incident field, which illuminates both the sample and the controlled scatterer, is then measured as a function of the controlled scatterer position and is used to mathematically reconstruct an image of the sample.","","","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

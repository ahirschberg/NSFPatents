The load-bearing structures transfer at least a portion of the force to at least one of the magnetostrictive elements. In this way, at least one of the magnetostrictive elements experiences the force transferred from the load-bearing structures. The force on the magnetostrictive element causes a change in magnetic flux of the magnetostrictive element.

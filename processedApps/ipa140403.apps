The plurality of index bits are processed to determine whether a matching index exists in the cache memory and the plurality of tag bits are processed to determine whether a matching tag exists in the cache memory, and a data line is retrieved from the cache memory if both a matching tag and a matching index exist in the cache memory. A random line in the cache memory can be replaced with a data line from a main memory, or evicted without replacement, based on the combination of index and tag misses, security contexts and protection bits. User-defined and/or vendor-defined replacement procedures can be utilized to replace data lines in the cache memory.",[Ruby B.

Each application interfaces with the storage media through an input/output (I/O) path executing I/O activities that access the storage media in accordance with configurable parameters of the I/O path. A run-time I/O pattern defined by the I/O activities is determined during a run-time period of the electronic device. At least one of the I/O path's configurable parameters is then modified based on the run-time I/O pattern. The method is readily adapted for power conservation by providing selections for the configurable parameters with each of the selections optimizing power usage for a hypothetical I/O pattern. Then, one or more configurable parameters are modified in accordance with one of the selections for which the hypothetical I/O pattern associated therewith is closest to the run-time I/O pattern.",[Dung Nguyen Tien][Gang Zhou][Xin Qi],[COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY],"Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119, the benefit of priority from provisional application Ser.

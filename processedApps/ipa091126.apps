12454815,20091126,20090289869,On-chip highly-efficient antennas using strong resonant coupling,"The invention relates to an antenna structure for coupling electromagnetic energy between a chip and an off-chip element, including a first resonant structure disposed on or in a chip. The first resonant structure is configured to have a first resonant frequency. The antenna structure also includes a second resonant structure disposed on or in an off-chip element. The second resonant structure is configured to have a second resonant frequency substantially the same as the first resonant frequency. The first resonant structure and the second resonant structure are mutually disposed within a near field distance of each other to form a coupled antenna structure that is configured to couple electromagnetic energy between the chip and the off-chip element. The electromagnetic energy has a selected wavelength in a wavelength range from microwave to sub-millimeter wave. The invention also relates to a method of calculating dimensions for a highly coupled antenna structure.",[Aydin Babakhani][Seyed Ali Hajimiri],[California Institure of Technology],"This application claims priority to and the benefit of co-pending U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

12454660,20091126,20090290156,Spatial light interference microscopy and fourier transform light scattering for cell and tissue characterization,"Methods and apparatus for rendering quantitative phase maps across and through transparent samples. A broadband source is employed in conjunction with an objective, Fourier optics, and a programmable two-dimensional phase modulator to obtain amplitude and phase information in an image plane. Methods, referred to as Fourier transform light scattering (FTLS), measure the angular scattering spectrum of the sample. FTLS combines optical microscopy and light scattering for studying inhomogeneous and dynamic media. FTLS relies on quantifying the optical phase and amplitude associated with a coherent image field and propagating it numerically to the scattering plane. Full angular information, limited only by the microscope objective, is obtained from extremely weak scatterers, such as a single micron-sized particle. A flow cytometer may employ FTLS sorting.",[Gabriel Popescu][Huafeng Ding][Zhuo Wang],[The Board of Trustee of the University of Illinois],"The present application claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application, Ser.

12506375,20091126,20090291313,"MICROELECTRONICS GRADE METAL SUBSTRATE, RELATED METAL-EMBEDDED DEVICES AND METHODS FOR FABRICATING SAME","Fabricating a microelectronics grade metal substrate comprises forming the metal substrate on a sacrificial substrate. An adhesion layer can be deposited on or over the surface of the sacrificial substrate. A seed layer of the metal can be deposited on or over the adhesion layer. The metal material can be deposited on the seed layer by electroplating or other low-temperature, low-stress process to form a microelectronics-grade metal substrate. Thin film sensors and/or other microelectronic devices, followed by appropriate insulating layer(s), may be fabricated on or over the sacrificial substrate before forming the metal substrate. The sacrificial silicon substrate can then be etched away, leaving the microelectronics-grade metal substrate, and possibly the microelectronics device. Another insulating layer(s), followed by another adhesion layer, another seed layer and additional amounts of the material forming the metal substrate can then be deposited over the now-exposed microelectronics device to encapsulate it within a metal shell.",[Arindom Datta][Xiaochun Li][Hongseok Choi],[Wisconsin Alummi Research Foundation],"This invention claims priority to U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser.

10593918,20071206,20070280876,Functionalization of Carbon Nanotubes in Acidic Media,"The present invention is generally directed to methods of functionalizing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in acidic media. By first dispersing CNTs in an acidic medium, bundled CNTs can be separated as individual CNTs, affording exposure of the CNT sidewalls, and thereby facilitating the functionalization of such CNTs, wherein functional groups are attached to the subsequently exposed sidewalls of these individualized CNTs. Once dispersed in this substantially unhundled state, the CNTs are functionalized according to one or more of a variety of functionalization processes. Typically, ultrasonication or non-covalent wrapping is not needed to afford such dispersion and subsequent functionalization. Additionally, such methods are easily scalable and can provide for sidewall-functionalized CNTs in large, industrial-scale quantities.

11966958,20080710,20080163946,MAGNETICALLY CONTROLLED VALVE FOR FLOW MANIPULATION IN POLYMER MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES,"A simple, external in-line valve for use in microfluidic devices constructed of elastomer such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is described. The actuation of the valve is based on the principle that flexible polymer walls of a liquid channel can be pressed together by the aid of a permanent magnet and a small metal bar. In the presence of a small NdFeB magnet lying below the channel of interest, the metal bar is pulled downward simultaneously pushing the thin layer of PDMS down thereby closing the channel stopping any flow of fluid. The operation of the valve is dependent on the thickness of the PDMS layer, the height of the channel, the gap between the chip and the magnet and the strength of the magnet. The microfluidic channels are completely closed to fluid flows commonly used in microfluidic applications. The valve allows for fabrication of a “thin chip” that allows for detection of chromophoric species within the microchannel via an external fiber optics detection system. C18-Modified reverse phase silica particles are packed into the microchannel using a temporary taper created by the magnetic valve and separations using both pressure and electrochromatographic driven methods is detailed.",[Frank A.

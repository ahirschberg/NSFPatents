When a single CdSe quantum dot (QD) is optically excited in close proximity to a silver nanowire (NW), emission from the QD couples directly to guided surface plasmons in the NW, causing the wire's ends to light up. Nonclassical photon correlations between the emission from the QD and the ends of the NW demonstrate that the latter stems from the generation of single, quantized plasmons. Results from a large number of devices show that the efficient coupling is accompanied by more than 2.5-fold enhancement of the QD spontaneous emission, in a good agreement with theoretical predictions.",[Mikhail D.

The ZnO nanotips are made at relatively low temperatures, giving ZnO a unique advantage over other wide bandgap semiconductors such as GaN and SiC. The nanotips have controlled uniform size, distribution and orientation. These ZnO nanotips are of single crystal quality, show n-type conductivity and have good optical properties. Selective growth of ZnO nanotips also has been realized on patterned (100) silicon on r-sapphire (SOS), and amorphous SiOon r-sapphire substrates. Self-assembled ZnO nanotips can also be selectively grown on patterned layers or islands made of a semiconductor, an insulator or a metal deposited on R-plane (01 2) AlOsubstrates as long as the ZnO grows in a columnar structure along the c-axis [0001] of ZnO on these materials. Such self-assembled ZnO nanotips and nanotip arrays are promising for applications in field emission displays and electron emission sources, photonic bandgap devices, near-field microscopy, UV optoelectronics, and bio-chemical sensors.

11559881,20070705,20070156813,METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COLLABORATIVE SYSTEM,"A collaborative system that includes automatic monitoring and management of reflector/servers and clients. The reflectors are in a logical cluster although their physical locations may be anywhere in the world. Reflector to reflector performance and status is continuously monitored. If a reflector-to-reflector link goes down or is underperforming, the reflector cluster is rerouted to provide desired performance. Clients are monitored and provide information via the network to register/management servers. A best path for the client capabilities is calculated and established. If network performance deteriorates, there are a tiered selection of session modifications that are initiated to compensate. These include reducing video detail levels, reducing number of video streams, reducing size of video windows, adjusting frame rate, and other corrective measures. The client software includes the ability to accept plug-in applications and functionality for customizable operation.

This DNA sequence, referred to as AdKC28, encodes for a protein that acts in conjunction with proteins encoded by either one of two other closely-related cDNAs, AdKeto1 and AdKeto2, to convert β-carotene (β,β-carotene) into astaxanthin (3,3′-dihydroxy-4,4′-diketo-β,β-carotene). Together, these cDNAs, when operably linked to promoters appropriate to the transgenic host, enable the production of astaxanthin and other carotenoids with 3-hydroxy-4-keto-β-rings in a variety of host cells and organisms.

11552547,20071108,20070256502,MEMS Capacitive Bending and Axial Strain Sensor,"A three-dimensional micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) capacitive bending and axial strain sensor capacitor is described. Two independent comb structures, incorporating suspended polysilicon interdigitated fingers, are fabricated simultaneously on a substrate that can displace independently of each other while attached to a substrate undergoing bending or axial deformation. A change in spacing between the interdigitated fingers will output a change in capacitance of the sensor and is the primary mode of operation of the device. On the bottom and to the end of each comb structure, a glass pad is attached to the comb structure to allow for ample surface area for affixing the sensor to a substrate. During fabrication, tethers are used to connect each comb structure to maintain equal spacing between the fingers before attachment to the substrate. After attachment, the tethers are broken to allow independent movement of each comb structure.

11741422,20071108,20070257364,METHODS OF REACTIVE COMPOSITE JOINING WITH MINIMAL ESCAPE OF JOINING MATERIAL,"The present inventors have observed that in some applications of reactive composite joining there is escape of a portion of the molten joining material through the edges of the joining regions. Such escape is not only a waste of expensive material (e.g. gold or indium) but also a reduction from the optimal thickness of the joining regions. In some applications, such escape also presents risk of short circuits or even fire. In this invention, two approaches are taken toward preventing damage to surroundings by the escape of molten joining material. First, escape may be prevented by trapping or containing the molten material near the joint, using barriers, dams, or similar means. Second, escape may be reduced by adjusting parameters within the joint, such as solder composition, joining pressure, or RCM thickness.

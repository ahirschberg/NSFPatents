By preparing a substance comprising at least one type of non-calamitic liquid crystal molecules and stabilizing the substance to form a mechanically flexible material, flexible conductive electrodes may be applied to the material to create an electro-mechanical energy conversion device which relies on the giant flexoelectric effect to produce electrical and/or mechanical energy that is usable in such applications as, for example, power sources, energy dissipation, sensors/transducers, and actuators. The ability to directly and accurately measure the giant flexoelectric effect for different types of non-calamitic liquid crystal molecules is important for identifying molecules that may be effective for particular applications.","[Antal I.

12158213,20081211,20080305047,Chemosensors Based on Quantum Dots and Oxazine Compounds,"We identified a mechanism to detect chemical changes with a modified semiconductor nanoparticle (e.g., an oxazine-adsorbed CdSeâ€”ZnS core-shell quantum dot). Our strategy is based on the chemical transformation of chromo-genie ligands adsorbed on the surface of a quantum dot. This activates an energy transfer pathway from the quantum dot to the adsorbed chromogenic ligands, which causes a change (e.g., increase or decrease) in a characteristic of fluorescent emission (e.g., intensity or lifetime). Thus, modified quantum dots acting through this mechanism can efficiently transduce a chemical event or occurrence into a change in optical signal. Our design can be adapted to signal chemical changes by a diversity of target analytes and, thus, it can be used to develop other fluorescent chemosensors based on the unique properties of quantum dots.",[Francisco M.

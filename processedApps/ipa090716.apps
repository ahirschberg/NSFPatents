12410274,20090716,20090180020,Method and Apparatus For Recording A Sequence Of Images Using A Moving Optical Element,"An imager () including a spatially varying optical element () which moves while the imager records a sequence of images. The optical element () can be an intensity reduction filter, a spectral or polarization filter, or a refractive or reflective element. Because the optical element () moves between frames, each scene portion is captured under a range of imaging conditions. A spatially varying intensity reduction filter enables imaging of each scene portion using multiple, different exposure to generate a high dynamic range image. A spatially varying spectral or polarization filter enables measurement of the spectral or polarization characteristics of radiation from each scene portion. A refractive or reflective element enables imaging of scene portions under various focal characteristics, thereby providing depth information and producing an image which is focused everywhere. A refractive or reflective element is used to apply different vertical and/or horizontal shifts to the different frames, thereby generating an enhanced-resolution image.",[Shree K. Nayar][Yoav Y.

12404220,20090716,20090181065,METHODS AND DEVICES FOR PROMOTING ENDOTHELIAL MORPHOGENESIS,"In one aspect, the present invention provides methods for promoting endothelial morphogenesis. The methods of this aspect of the invention include the step of providing to one or more endothelial cells an amount of an osteoprotegerin sufficient to promote endothelial morphogenesis. The methods of this aspect of the invention can be practiced in vivo or in vitro. In another aspect, the present invention provides implantable medical devices that each include: (a) a device body; and (b) a layer attached to a surface of the device body, the layer comprising a molecule selected from the group consisting of osteoprotegerin and a nucleic acid molecule encoding osteoprotegerin, wherein the device is adapted to be completely or partially implanted into an animal body. The implanted medical device thus promotes the growth of blood vessels in the surrounding tissue, thereby reducing or preventing the formation of a collagenous capsule around the implanted medical device.",[Uriel M.

The apparatus or laser ultrasonic apparatus involving an acoustic signal generator and at least one interferometer sensing unit with shared reference is used to perform non-contact measurement. Horizontal and vertical stresses are evaluated in more than three angular directions (sometimes called azimuths) around the axis of the borehole using acoustoelastic principle. The magnitudes and directions of principal pristine stresses in the rock formation are derived from the measurement data by using closed-form solutions. Magnetometer is used to determine the angular direction of the stress measurement.","","","",20110427,"The research involved in this application was funded in part by National Science Foundation, Award ID 1042966.

The methods further relate to imaging a material submersed in liquid by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), wherein the AFM has a microfabricated AFM probe comprising a nanoneedle probe connected to a cantilever beam. The nanoneedle probe is immersed in the liquid, and the rest of the AFM probe, including the cantilever beam to which the nanoneedle probe is attached, remains outside the liquid. The cantilever is oscillated and the nanoneedle probe tip taps the material to image the material immersed in liquid. In an aspect, the material is supported on a shaped substrate to provide a spatially-varying immersion depth with specially defined regions for imaging by any of the methods and systems of the present invention.","","","",20110428,This invention was made with government support under CBET 0731096 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

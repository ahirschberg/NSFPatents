The methods and processes easily incorporate annealing, deposition, patterning, lithography, etching, oxidation, epitaxy and chemical mechanical polishing for forming suitable devices, such as diodes and MOSFETs. Such fabrication is a suitable and more cost-effective alternative to a process of diffusion or doping, typical for forming p-n junctions. The process flow does not require temperatures above 700 degrees Centigrade. Formation of p-n junctions in discrete silicon diodes and MOSFETs are also provided, fabricated at low temperatures in the absence of diffusion or doping.

11748918,20071115,20070263430,METHOD FOR SWITCHING MAGNETIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY ELEMENTS AND MAGNETIC ELEMENT STRUCTURES,"A method for storing data in a magnetic memory element of an array of elements which avoids inadvertent switching of other elements is disclosed. First and second magnetic fields are applied to a selected magnetic element for a first time interval to switch the element into an intermediate state where minor domains are created. A second value of magnetic fields are then applied large enough to switch the magnetization of the minor domains, but not large enough to switch the magnetization of an adjacent memory cell. Once the minor domain is switched, the magnetization of the magnetic element assumes the state where the major domain has a magnetization direction representing the value of the stored data bit. Reducing the grain size of crystallites contained in a bit reduces the intrinsic anisotropy of the magnetic memory element thus improving bit selectivity.

A broadly applicable homogeneous detection system is provided. It utilizes components of the blood coagulation cascade in the presence of polystyrene microspheres (MS) as a signal amplifier. Russell's viper venom factor X activator (RVV-X) triggers the cascade, which results in an eye-visible phase transition—precipitation of MS bound to clotted fibrin. An allosteric RNA aptamer, RNA132, with affinity for RVV-X and human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was created. RNA132 inhibits enzymatic activity of RVV-X. The effector molecule, VEGF, reverses the inhibitory activity of RNA132 on RVV-X and restores its enzymatic activity, thus triggering the cascade and enabling the phase transition. Similar results were obtained for another allosteric aptamer modulated by a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The assay is instrumentation-free for both processing and readout.

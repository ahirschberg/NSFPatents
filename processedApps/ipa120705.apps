13389726,20120705,20120168309,ELECTROWETTING AND ELECTROFLUIDIC DEVICES WITH LAPLACE BARRIERS AND RELATED METHODS,Electrowetting and electrofluidic devices and methods. The device includes a hydrophobic channel formed between first and second substrates and a polar fluid and a non-polar fluid contained in the channel. An electrode with a dielectric layer is electrically connected to a voltage source. A Laplace barrier within the hydrophobic channel defines a fluid pathway that is open to the movement of the polar fluid within the channel. The polar fluid moves to a first position when the voltage source is biased at a first voltage that is less than or equal to a threshold voltage. The polar fluid moves to a second position when the voltage source is biased with a second voltage that is greater than the first voltage.,"",[UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/234,070, filed Aug. 14, 2009; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/234,099, filed Aug. 14, 2009; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/307,637, filed Feb. 24, 2010; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/308,105, filed Feb. 25, 2010.

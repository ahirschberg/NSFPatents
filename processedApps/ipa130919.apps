A patterned photoresist is applied to a substrate, in which the patterned photoresist corresponds to a pattern of the nanoporous metal multiple electrode array. A metal alloy including a sacrificial alloying element is deposited in the pattern of the nanoporous metal electrode array. The patterned photoresist is removed to expose the metal alloy as deposited. At least part of the sacrificial alloying element is removed from the metal alloy to create nanoporous metal electrode tips thereby forming the nanoporous metal multiple electrode array. The resultant nanoporous metal multiple electrode array has improved impedance characteristics in comparison to conventional multiple electrode arrays.",[Martin L.

The algorithm () progressively identifies a subset of bipartite networks that contain only those biomarkers that can separate the network into modules containing significantly different proportions of the subpopulation, and () outputs trends of key parameters to enable the researcher to analyze how the networks were identified. The algorithm outputs should for example enable biomedical researchers to rapidly identify key biomarkers, and infer the underlying biological mechanisms implicated in a wide range of diseases.",[Suresh K.

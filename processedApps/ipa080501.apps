11623428,20080501,20080102849,BEACON AIDED LOW COMPLEXITY DISTRIBUTED AUTONOMOUS DYNAMIC FREQUENCY SELECTION,"When implemented on a single access point, the system autonomously adjusts the operating channel of an 802.11h compliant network so the network operates on the channel with the least interference. When deployed on the access nodes in a campus or urban setting, the system rapidly converges to a stable interference-minimizing frequency re-use pattern with the average reduction in interference realized by each 802.11 cluster in the range of 19 dB (as device density increases, the expected reduction in interference increases with the exact gain in interference reduction a function of the specific propagation environment and network topology). Significant, though smaller, expected reductions in interference are also realized by legacy systems which are not implementing the algorithm but operating in the presence of the enhanced access points. When new access points are added to the network, the network automatically converges to a near optimal frequency reuse pattern. This is accomplished without any message passing between access nodes, without any adjustments to the existing 802.11 protocol, without user guidance, without prior or externally generated knowledge of the environment or network, and with minimal additional computational complexity at the access node.",[James Neel][Jeffrey Reed][Robert Gilles],"","This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 60/862,882 filed Oct. 25, 2006, and the complete contents thereof are herein incorporated by reference.",20070116,The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of Office of Naval Research Grant Number N00014-03-1-0629 and National Science Foundation Integrated Research and Education in Advanced Networking&#x2014;an IGERT program Grant Number DGE-998 7586.,"","","",""

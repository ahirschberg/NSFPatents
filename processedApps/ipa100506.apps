The glyconanospheres preferably contain as well carboxyl-modified iron oxide nanocrystals. In addition to electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged dextran, the negatively charged CdSe—ZnS QDs (and negatively charged iron oxide nanocrystals, if present), and the positively charged polylysine, covalent amide bonds were introduced to cross link the QDs (and negatively charged iron oxide nanocrystals, if present) with the polysaccharide matrix to further stabilize the glyconanospheres. The dextran residues on the surface of the nanospheres show high affinity toward the glucose binding protein-Concanavalin A (Con A). As a result, these luminescent CdSe—ZnS QD incorporated glyconanospheres are a useful tool for studying carbohydrate-protein interactions that are critical steps in bacterial and viral infection.",[Zeev Rosenzweig][Yongfen Chen][Desheng Wang],"[University of New Orleans Research and Technology Foundation, Inc.]","Priority of our U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

The method includes using microwave radiation to induce exfoliation of a semiconductor layer from a donor substrate. The donor substrate may be implanted, bonded to a carrier substrate, and heated via the microwave radiation. The implanted portion of the donor substrate may include increased damage and/or dipoles (relative to non-implanted portions of the donor substrate), which more readily absorb microwave radiation. Consequently, by using microwave radiation, an exfoliation time may be reduced to 12 seconds or less. In addition, a presented method also includes the use of focused ion beam implantation to achieve a pattern-less transfer of a semiconductor layer onto a carrier substrate.",[Douglas C.

13255567,20111229,20110320816,SYSTEMS AND METHOD FOR MALWARE DETECTION,"A system and method for distinguishing human input events from malware-generated events includes one or more central processing units (CPUs), one or more input devices and memory. The memory includes program code that when executed by the CPU causes the CPU to obtain a first set of input events from a user utilizing the input device. The first input events are used to obtain or derive a feature indicative of the user, such as a multi-dimensional feature vector as provided by a support vector machine. Second input events are then obtained, and the second input events are classified against the feature to determine if either the user or malware initiated the second input events.",[Danfeng Yao][Deian Stefan][Chehai Wu],"[Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 61/210,097, filed on Mar. 13, 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",20100313,"The Research Leading to the present invention was supported in part, by National Science Foundation Grant No. CCF-0648985.

For each event identified in traversing the program trace, a trace slice of which the identified event is a part is identified based on the parameter instance of the identified event. For each trace slice of which the identified event is a part, the identified event is added to an end of a record of the trace slice. These parametric trace slices can be used in a variety of different manners, such as for monitoring, mining, and predicting.",[Grigore Rosu][Feng Chen][Patrick O.

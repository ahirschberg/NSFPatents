11181348,20070118,20070014345,Low complexity Tomlinson-Harashima precoders,"A method to design low complexity pipelined Tomlinson-Harashima precoders and its associated circuit architectures have been described. The low complexity pipelined TH precoder design relies on the proposed low complexity precomputation based FIR filters. In the low complexity precomputation method for FIR filters, each multiplier is replaced with a multiplexer.

11487067,20070118,20070014378,System and method for MIMO equalization for DSP transceivers,"A method to efficiently deal with FEXT crosstalk in wireline communication system via MIMO equalization is presented. A MIMO-DFE based receiver architecture is developed to demonstrate the advantage over the traditional receiver design. A MIMO structure for systems with TH precoding is also developed for 10GBASE-T application. The proposed architecture overcomes the limitation of the traditional schemes and achieves a better SNR performance and lower receiver complexity. The proposed method relies on the fact that FEXT inherently contains information about the symbols transmitted from the three far end transmitters and it can be viewed as a signal rather than noise. Therefore, MIMO techniques are applied to turn FEXT into a benefit for the receiver design.

11181347,20070118,20070014380,Parallel Tomlinson-Harashima precoders,"A method to design parallel TH precoders and a circuit architecture to implement parallel TH precoders have been presented. The parallel design relies on the fact that a TH precoder can be viewed as an IIR filter with an input equal to the sum of the original input to the TH precoder and a compensation signal. The parallel design also relies on the fact that the compensation signal has finite levels. Therefore, precomputation techniques can be applied to calculate intermediate signal values for all possible values of the compensation signal.

11169076,20070118,20070014488,"Automatically and accurately conflating road vector data, street maps, and orthoimagery","Automatic conflation systems and techniques which provide vector-imagery conflation and map-imagery conflation. Vector-imagery conflation is an efficient approach that exploits knowledge from multiple data sources to identify a set of accurate control points. Vector-imagery conflation provides automatic and accurate alignment of various vector datasets and imagery, and is appropriate for GIS applications, for example, requiring alignment of vector data and imagery over large geographical regions. Map-imagery conflation utilizes common vector datasets as “glue” to automatically integrate street maps with imagery. This approach provides automatic, accurate, and intelligent images that combine the visual appeal and accuracy of imagery with the detailed attribution information often contained in such diverse maps. Both conflation approaches are applicable for GIS applications requiring, for example, alignment of vector data, raster maps, and imagery. If desired, the conflated data generated by such systems may be retrieved on-demand.

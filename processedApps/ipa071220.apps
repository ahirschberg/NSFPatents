11717934,20071220,20070290405,Polyphosphate glasses as a plasticizer for nylon,"The present invention discloses the miscibility of inorganic phosphate glass and organic polymer prepared by blending both components in the liquid phase using conventional polymer processing methods. By utilizing low Tg phosphate glasses to plasticize nylon, e.g. polyamide 6, a new class of plasticizer is introduced that allows for the creation of unique nylon polymer composites. These materials display tunable morphologies, interesting properties, and significant reduction in flammability, while easing the processing of nylon through a substantial reduction of viscosity. The addition of a low Tg phosphate glass in small amounts (less than 10% by volume) to a nylon matrix results in a drastic reduction in viscosity and a decrease in the nylon glass transition temperature and flammability, with the capability of adding a low Tg phosphate glass up to 60% by volume. The observed mechanical properties of the nylon/phosphate glass hybrid are consistent with that of plasticized polymers.

During operation, the system receives a description of the circuit design. Next, the system determines a target value for a control signal in the description and a mutant value for the control signal. The system then determines if an input sequence exists for the circuit design that stimulates the control signal to the target value and causes the effects of the target value and the effects of the mutant value to reach an observation point in the circuit such that the effects of the target value and the effects of the mutant value differ at the observation point. If such an input sequence exists, the system then simulates operation of the circuit design using the input sequence. During simulation, the system generates two sets of signal outputs for the circuit design. The first set of signal outputs is affected by the target value for the control signal, while the second set of signal outputs is affected by the mutant value for the control signal.

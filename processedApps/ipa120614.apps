Such heterogenous surface compositions and configurations, related systems and methods for sensing particle or analyte interaction therewith can selectively and/or differentially interact with a range of particles/analytes, in lieu of specific molecular sensor-analyte interactions for each particle. These interactions of various analytes or particles can differ sufficiently in strength and range between multiple analyte types or particles to effect a separation of analytes or particles mixtures, in a way that requires no sensing or detection. With incorporation of a sensing mechanism, discrimination/detection of different compounds within an analyte mixture can be accomplished.","","","This application is a divisional of and claims priority benefit from application Ser.

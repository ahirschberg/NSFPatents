A voltage-to-current (V-I) converter converts the output voltage signal into a current signal. An output stage including a current integrator integrates the current signal to generate an integrated voltage. An amplitude to time converter generates a pulse train from the integrated voltage, wherein a timing of the pulses in the pulse train represents the original time varying voltage signal. The pulse train representation permits transmission and accurate remote reconstruction of the original time varying voltage signal, such as signals generated by electrodes implanted inside a subject, including neural signals.

The methods typically are directed to refinement of statistical observed versus expected codon pair frequencies using one of several factors such as amino acid sequence homology, secondary or tertiary structural considerations, and empirical measurements. In some synthetic genes codon pairs are predicted not to cause a translational pause in the host organism, thereby providing a polynucleotide sequence encoding the desired polypeptide with desired translational kinetics properties. The methods can be performed using multiple parameter nucleotide sequence optimization methods, such as branch-and-bound methods for nucleotide sequence refinement.

An quadratic timing model is used to represent each delay element along a circuit path, wherein each element's delay has a first-order relationship to local variations and a second-order relationship to global variations. Propagation of the modeled delays through the circuit is efficiently done via straightforward ADD operations where an input propagates through another element in a circuit path, and via a MAX operation (or an approximation thereof) where two or more inputs merge at an intersection. The inputs to the MAX operator can be tested for gaussianity, and can be processed by the MAX operation (or its approximation) if they are substantially gaussian. Otherwise, they may be stored in a tuple for processing at later points along the circuit path.",[Lizheng Zhang][Yuhen Hu][Chun-ping Chen],"","",20060525,This invention was made with United States government support awarded by the following agencies:National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant No(s).: 0093309,"","","",""

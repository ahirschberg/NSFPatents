12755578,20100729,20100187106,"ULTRA-SENSITIVE, PORTABLE CAPILLARY SENSOR","A portable, lightweight, rugged, easy-to-operate biosensor useful for rapidly detecting cells, viruses, antibodies, and other proteins. A capillary tube has a capture antibody immobilized on its interior surface. The specific capture antibody is selected based upon a desired target analyte to be detected. A sample potentially containing the target antigen is introduced into the capillary tube. Thereafter, a second antibody labeled with a fluorescent dye is introduced. Upon excitation by electromagnetic energy, typically supplied by a laser, the fluorescence of the sample is captured and analyzed. The apparatus is extremely compact and rugged making it ideal for field use. In addition, accurate results may be obtained by relatively unskilled operators directly from a self-contained readout. Optionally, an external device (e.g., a computer) may be connected to the apparatus via an optional interface. The analysis time provided by the biosensor system of the invention is shorter than has heretofore been possible.",[Omowunmi SADIK][Jason KARASINSKI],[Research Foundation of State   University of New York],"The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

12709072,20100729,20100190244,"RIBOSWITCHES, METHODS FOR THEIR USE, AND COMPOSITIONS FOR USE WITH RIBOSWITCHES","It has been discovered that certain natural mRNAs serve as metabolite-sensitive genetic switches wherein the RNA directly binds a small organic molecule. This binding process changes the conformation of the mRNA, which causes a change in gene expression by a variety of different mechanisms. Modified versions of these natural “riboswitches” (created by using various nucleic acid engineering strategies) can be employed as designer genetic switches that are controlled by specific effector compounds. Such effector compounds that activate a riboswitch are referred to herein as trigger molecules. The natural switches are targets for antibiotics and other small molecule therapies. In addition, the architecture of riboswitches allows actual pieces of the natural switches to be used to construct new non-immunogenic genetic control elements, for example the aptamer (molecular recognition) domain can be swapped with other non-natural aptamers (or otherwise modified) such that the new recognition domain causes genetic modulation with user-defined effector compounds. The changed switches become part of a therapy regimen—turning on, or off, or regulating protein synthesis. Newly constructed genetic regulation networks can be applied in such areas as living biosensors, metabolic engineering of organisms, and in advanced forms of gene therapy treatments.",[RONALD R.

11835818,20080103,20080000949,Method of Joining Using Reactive Multilayer Foils With Enhanced Control of Molten Joining Materials,"In accordance with the invention, bodies of materials are joined by disposing between them a reactive multilayer foil and one or more layers of meltable joining material such as braze or solder. The bodies are pressed together against the foil and joining material, and the foil is ignited to melt the joining material. The pressing is near the critical pressure and typically produces a joint having a strength of at least 70-85% the maximum strength producible at practical maximum pressures. Thus for example, reactively formed stainless steel soldered joints that were heretofore made at an applied pressure of about 100 MPa can be made with substantially the same strength at a critical applied pressure of about 10 kPa. Advantages of the process include minimization of braze or solder extrusion and reduced equipment and processing costs, especially in the joining of large bodies.

This electric field induced biaxiality (EFIB) mode is provided using any dielectric orthogonal nematic, smectic or columnar bent-core liquid crystal phase. The nature of the switching is dielectric (not piezoelectric) and does not involve variation of layer spacing variation, so as to be mechanically much more stable than prior systems.

Such processes involve the derivatization of multi- and single-wall carbon nanotubes, including small diameter (ca. 0.7 nm) single-wall carbon nanotubes, with diazonium species. The method allows the chemical attachment of a variety of organic compounds to the side and ends of carbon nanotubes. These chemically modified nanotubes have applications in polymer composite materials, molecular electronic applications, and sensor devices. The methods of derivatization include electrochemical induced reactions, thermally induced reactions (via in-situ generation of diazonium compounds or preformed diazonium compounds), and photochemically induced reactions. The derivatization causes significant changes in the spectroscopic properties of the nanotubes. The estimated degree of functionality is ca. 1 out of every 20 to 30 carbons in a nanotube bearing a functionality moiety. Such electrochemical reduction processes can be adapted to apply site-selective chemical functionalization of nanotubes. Moreover, when modified with suitable chemical groups, the derivatized nanotubes are chemically compatible with a polymer matrix, allowing transfer of the properties of the nanotubes (such as, mechanical strength or electrical conductivity) to the properties of the composite material as a whole.

New hydrides with direct Si—Ge bonds derived from the family of compounds (HGe)SiH(x=1-4) are used to grow uniform, relayed and highly planar films with low defect densities at unprecedented low temperatures between about 300-450° C., circumventing entirely the need of thick compositionally graded buffer layer and lift off technologies. At about 500-700° C., SiGequantum dots are grown with narrow size distribution, defect-free microstructures and highly homogeneous elemental content at the atomic level. The method provides precise control of morphology, composition, structure and strain via the incorporation of the entire Si/Ge framework of the gaseous precursor into the film.

This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene. Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization.

The actuation of the valve is based on the principle that flexible polymer walls of a liquid channel can be pressed together by the aid of a permanent magnet and a small metal bar. In the presence of a small NdFeB magnet lying below the channel of interest, the metal bar is pulled downward simultaneously pushing the thin layer of PDMS down thereby closing the channel stopping any flow of fluid. The operation of the valve is dependent on the thickness of the PDMS layer, the height of the channel, the gap between the chip and the magnet and the strength of the magnet. The microfluidic channels are completely closed to fluid flows commonly used in microfluidic applications. The valve allows for fabrication of a “thin chip” that allows for detection of chromophoric species within the microchannel via an external fiber optics detection system. C18-Modified reverse phase silica particles are packed into the microchannel using a temporary taper created by the magnetic valve and separations using both pressure and electrochromatographic driven methods is detailed.",[Frank A.

A fluidization chamber is provided with a fluidizing medium (e.g., a fluidizing gas) directed in a first fluidizing direction, e.g., upward into and through a bed containing a volume of nanoparticles and/or nanopowders. A second source of air/gas flow is provided with respect to the fluidization chamber, the secondary air/gas flow generally being oppositely (or substantially oppositely) directed relative to the fluidizing medium. Turbulence created by the secondary gas flow, e.g., a jet from a micro-jet nozzle, is advantageously effective to aerate the agglomerates and the shear generated by the jet is advantageously effective to break apart nanoagglomerates and/or reduce the tendency for nanoagglomerates to form or reform. A downwardly directed source of secondary gas flow located near the main gas distributor leads to full fluidization of the entire amount of powder in the column. In addition, the oppositely directed fluid flow facilitates powder circulation within the fluidization chamber, thereby enhancing fluidization results. Use of oppositely directed fluid flow is believed to transition a bed that is exhibiting agglomerate bubbling fluidization (ABF) behavior into a bed that exhibits agglomerate particulate fluidization (APF) behavior",[Robert Pfeffer][Jose A.

The substrate comprises a wafer layer and may further include an adhesion layer deposited on the wafer layer. An anodic alumina template is formed on the substrate. When a rigid substrate such as Si is used, the resulting anodic alumina film is more tractable, easily grown on extensive areas in a uniform manner, and manipulated without danger of cracking. The substrate can be manipulated to obtain free-standing alumina templates of high optical quality and substantially flat surfaces. PAA films can also be grown this way on patterned and non-planar surfaces. Furthermore, under certain conditions the resulting PAA is missing the barrier layer (partially or completely) and the bottom of the pores can be readily accessed electrically. The resultant film can be used as a template for forming an array of nanowires wherein the nanowires are deposited electrochemically into the pores of the template. By patterning the electrically conducting adhesion layer, pores in different areas of the template can be addressed independently, and can be filled electrochemically by different materials. Single-stage and multi-stage nanowire-based thermoelectric devices, consisting of both n-type and p-type nanowires, can be assembled on a silicon substrate by this method.",[Oded Rabin][Paul R.

With no surface modification, one may form a bilayer supported on the glass capillary extending across the nanopore orifice. Changing the surface properties from that of bare glass to a moderately hydrophobic surface produces a lipid monolayer above the glass and spontaneously yields a bilayer across the nanopore orifice, effectively corralling a single protein ion channel in the lipid bilayer region spanning nanopore orifice. The bilayer structure over the modified nanopore is such that current can only flow through the protein ion channel. The protein ion channel is able to diffuse in the bilayer above the pore opening, but cannot leave this area to enter the lipid monolayer. The bilayer formed across the nanopore orifice exhibits high electrical breakdown voltage, is stable to mechanical vibrations, and is long lived. Resistance through the protein channel can be measured electrically and is exploited for stochastic single-molecule detection.

The architecture and design methodology can be used in logic circuits, gate arrays, FPGAs, cryptographic processors, etc. In one embodiment, the implementation details of how to create a secure encryption module can be hidden from the designer. The designer is thus, able to write the code for the design of DPA-resistant logic circuits using the same design techniques used for conventional logic circuits. Contrary to other complicated DPA-blocking techniques, the designer does not need specialized knowledge and understanding of the methodology. In one embodiment, the automated design flow generates a secure design from a Verilog or VHDL netlist.

12091069,20080918,20080228446,"Method and Apparatus for Signal Detection, Classification and Estimation from Compressive Measurements","The recently introduced theory of Compressive Sensing (CS) enables a new method for signal recovery from incomplete information (a reduced set of “compressive” linear measurements), based on the assumption that the signal is sparse in some dictionary. Such compressive measurement schemes are desirable in practice for reducing the costs of signal acquisition, storage, and processing. However, the current CS framework considers only a certain task (signal recovery) and only in a certain model setting (sparsity).We show that compressive measurements are in fact information scalable, allowing one to answer a broad spectrum of questions about a signal when provided only with a reduced set of compressive measurements. These questions range from complete signal recovery at one extreme down to a simple binary detection decision at the other. (Questions in between include, for example, estimation and classification.) We provide techniques such as a “compressive matched filter” for answering several of these questions given the available measurements, often without needing to first reconstruct the signal. In many cases, these techniques can succeed with far fewer measurements than would be required for full signal recovery, and such techniques can also be computationally more efficient. Based on additional mathematical insight, we discuss information scalable algorithms in several model settings, including sparsity (as in CS), but also in parametric or manifold-based settings and in model-free settings for generic statements of detection, classification, and estimation problems.",[Richard G Baraniuk][Marco F.

This reactive joining method provides very localized heating to the components and rapid cooling across the joint. The rapid cooling results in a very fine microstructure of the solder or braze material. The scale of the fine microstructure of the solder or braze material is dependant on cooling rate of the reactive joints which varies with geometries and properties of the foils and components. The microstructure of the solder or braze layer of the joints formed by melting solder in a furnace is much coarser due to the slow cooling rate. Reactive joints with finer solder or braze microstructure show higher shear strength compared with those made by conventional furnace joining with much coarser solder or braze microstructure.

12053920,20081225,20080318992,METHOD OF USING A PKC INHIBITOR TO REVERSE PREFRONTAL CORTICAL DECLINES,"Aging is associated with deficiencies in the prefrontal cortex, including working memory impairment, and compromised integrity of neuronal dendrites. The role of Protein Kinase C(PKC) in age-related prefrontal cortical impairments had not been previously determined. The inventors provides evidence that PKC activity is associated with prefrontal cortical dysfunction in aging. The inventors provide methods of reversing the effects of prefrontal cortical decline, improving cognition, and improving working memory in aged subjects by providing a phenanthridinium alkaloid or closely related compound to the subject. The inventors found chelerythrine reversed working memory impairments in aged rats and enhanced working memory in aged rhesus monkeys. Improvement correlated with age, with older monkeys demonstrating a greater degree of improvement following PKC inhibition. The inventors findings indicate that PKC is dysregulated in aged subjects and that PKC inhibitors may be used to treatment improve cognition in the elderly.",[Amy F. T.

13550988,20130124,20130020197,LED-BASED SCREENER FOR PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL MATERIALS DISCOVERY,"An LED-based materials analysis apparatus that measures the photoelectrochemical response of materials to illumination. The apparatus uses an array of light sources such as a plurality of LEDs that provide light of desired wavelengths to illuminate one or more samples of materials of interest that are immersed in an electrolyte. A measurement circuit is connected between a transparent conductor attached to each sample of interest and a counter electrode. In some measurements, a third, standard electrode may be connected to the measurement circuit. A pulsing circuit that operates the LEDs causes each sample to be tested according to a predetermined sequence. Data is collected using a programmable computer operating under the control of instructions recorded on a machine readable medium. The data is analyzed and is available to be displayed to a user, recorded in a database, or communicated to another apparatus or process.",[Jay R. Winkler][Gates R.

The first and second fluid flow paths at least partially in communication with the channel. A light emitting device is positioned adjacent to the channel. At least one first fluid source is in communication with the first fluid path such that a first fluid is moveable along the first fluid path and at least one second fluid source in communication with the second fluid path such that a second fluid is moveable along the second fluid path. The fluid paths are configured so the first fluid and second fluid move through the channel to define an adjustable liquid gradient refractive index distribution in the channel. Adjustment of the liquid gradient refractive index distribution permits a change of liquid lens focal distance or an angular adjustment of light.,[Tony J.

The process comprises placing the nanostructures in a liquid composition comprising an immiscible combination of aqueous phase and an organic phase. The mixture is mixed for a period of time sufficient to form an emulsion and then allowed to stand undisturbed so that the phases are allowed to separate. As a result the nanostructure materials locate at the interface of the forming phases and are uniformly dispersed along that interface. A film of the nanostructure materials will then form on a substrate intersecting the interface, said substrate having been placed in the mixture before the phases are allowed to settle and separate.",[Julio M.

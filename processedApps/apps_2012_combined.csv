This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene. Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization.

This selection scheme uses spatial correlation, channel reciprocal condition number, delay spread and average Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) information to select the antenna radiation pattern at the receiver. Using this approach, it is possible to achieve capacity gains in a multi-element reconfigurable antenna system without modifying the data frame of a conventional wireless communication system. The capacity gain achievable with this configuration selection approach is calculated through numerical simulations using reconfigurable circular patch antennas at the receiver of a MIMO system that employs minimum mean square error receivers for channel estimation. Channel capacity and Bit Error Rate (BER) results show the improvement offered relative to a conventional antenna selection technique for reconfigurable MIMO systems.","",[DREXEL UNIVERSITY],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

Cancer cells upregulate glucose uptake and metabolism for maintaining accelerated growth and proliferation rates. Specifically blocking these processes is likely to provide new insights to the role of glucose transport and metabolism in tumorigenesis, as well as in apoptosis. As solid tumors outgrow the surrounding vasculature, they encounter microenvironments with a limited supply of nutrients leading to a glucose deprived environment in some regions of the tumor. Cancer cells living in the glucose deprived environment undergo changes to prevent glucose deprivation-induced apoptosis. Knowing how cancer cells evade apoptosis induction is also likely to yield valuable information and knowledge of how to overcome the resistance to apoptosis induction in cancer cells. Disclosed herein are novel anticancer compounds that inhibit basal glucose transport, resulting in tumor suppression and new methods for the study of glucose deprivation in animal cancer research.","",[OHIO UNIVERSITY],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/317,062, filed Mar. 24, 2010; the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.",20110324,This work was sponsored in part by the National Science Foundation through a Partnership for Innovation Grant (HER-0227907).

A method was developed which provides phosphonium-based, pyridinium-based, and imidazolium-based IL-mediated advanced sol-gel organic-inorganic hybrid materials for capillary microextraction. Scanning electron microscopy results demonstrate that ILs can serve as porogenic agents in sol-gel reactions. IL-mediated sol-gel coatings prepared with silanol-terminated polymers provided up to 28 times higher extractions compared to analogous sol-gel coatings prepared without any IL in the sol solution. This study shows that IL-generated porous morphology alone is not enough to provide effective extraction media: careful choice of the organic polymer and the precursor with close sol-gel reactivity must be made to ensure effective chemical bonding of the organic polymer to the created sol-gel material to be able to provide the desired sorbent characteristics.","",[UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA],"This application is a continuation of prior filed International Application, Serial Number PCT US2010 035797 filed May 21, 2010, which claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/180,274 filed May 21, 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference into this disclosure.",20111121,This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DGE-0221681 awarded by the National Science Foundation and Grant No. DE-AC05-000R22750 awarded by the Department of Homeland Security.

The key to improving the quality of radiosurgery is to increase the dose falloff rate from high dose regions inside the tumor to low dose regions of nearby healthy tissues and structures. Dynamic photon painting (DPP) further increases dose falloff rate by treating a target by moving a beam source along a dynamic trajectory, where the speed, direction and even dose rate of the beam source change constantly during irradiation. DPP creates dose gradient that rivals proton Bragg Peak and outperforms Gamma Knife® radiosurgery.","",[STC.UNM],"",20100930,This invention was made with government support under NSF CBET-0755054.

13388596,20120823,20120211084,MULTIPLE EMULSIONS CREATED USING JETTING AND OTHER TECHNIQUES,"The present invention generally relates to emulsions, and more particularly, to multiple emulsions. In one aspect, multiple emulsions are formed by urging a fluid into a channel, e.g., by causing the fluid to enter the channel as a “jet.” Side channels can be used to encapsulate the fluid with a surrounding fluid. In some cases, multiple fluids may flow through a channel collinearly before multiple emulsion droplets are formed. The fluidic channels may also, in certain embodiments, include varying degrees of hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity. As examples, the fluidic channel may be relatively hydrophilic upstream of an intersection (or other region within the channel) and relatively hydrophobic downstream of the intersection, or vice versa. In some cases, the average cross-sectional dimension may change, e.g., at an intersection. For instance, the average cross-sectional dimension may increase at the intersection. Surprisingly, a relatively small increase in dimension, in combination with a change in hydrophilicity of the fluidic channel, may delay droplet formation of a stream of collinearly-flowing multiple fluids under certain flow conditions; accordingly, the point at which multiple emulsion droplets are formed can be readily controlled within the fluidic channel. In some cases, the multiple droplet may be formed from the collinear flow of fluids at (or near) a single location within the fluidic channel. In addition, unexpectedly, systems such as those described herein may be used to encapsulate fluids in single or multiple emulsions that are difficult or impossible to encapsulate using other techniques, such as fluids with low surface tension, viscous fluids, or viscoelastic fluids. Other aspects of the invention are generally directed to methods of making and using such systems, kits involving such systems, emulsions created using such systems, or the like.","",[President and Fellows of Harvard College],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

In one embodiment, a piezoelectric actuator includes a substrate, a first electrode positioned on the substrate, a piezoelectric thin film positioned on the first electrode, and a second electrode positioned on the piezoelectric thin film. The displacement capability of the actuator is enhanced by reducing the tensile stresses of the piezoelectric thin film. In some embodiments, a constant DC voltage applied to the piezoelectric actuator generates compressive in-plane stresses, which counteract the tensile in-plane stresses. As a result, the overall tensile stresses in the actuator are reduced, and the actuator displacement is improved.","",[University of Washington through its Center for Commercialization],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 61/466,375, filed Mar. 22, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",20120322,This invention was made with govenrment support under grant number CMMI-0826501 awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

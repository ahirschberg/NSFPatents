12874855,20101230,20100331672,METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MOTILITY CONTRAST IMAGING,A system for motility contrast imaging a biological target within tissue comprising a CCD array; an illumination source for generating an incoming beam; a first beam splitter for receiving the incoming beam and producing an object beam and a reference beam; a second beam splitter for illuminating a multitude of biological targets with the object beam and for directing backscattered object beams towards the CCD array; a computer-controlled delay stage for zero-path-matching the reference beam to the backscattered object beams; a reference beam that intersects the backscattered object beams at an angle to produce a series of interference fringes that modulate Fourier-domain information; and a computer for receiving a time series of Fourier-domain information. The interference fringes between the backscattered object beam and the reference beam are recorded by the CCD array and passed to the computer which constructs a digital hologram at successive times.,[David D.

12665893,20101230,20100333223,CARBOHYDRATE BINDING PLANT HYDROLASES WHICH ALTER PLANT CELL WALLS,"The present invention discloses a transgenic plant cell which includes a nucleic acid construct. The nucleic acid construct contains a nucleic acid molecule encoding a plant endo-1,4-β-xylanase and/or a plant endo-1,4-β-glucanase, where the plant endo-1,4-β-xylanase and/or the plant endo-1,4-β-glucanase each have a modular carbohydrate binding domain, or multiple modular carbohydrate binding domains. The nucleic acid construct also includes a plant promoter and a plant termination sequence, where the plant promoter and the plant termination sequence are operably coupled to the nucleic acid molecule and at least one of the plant promoter or the plant termination sequence is heterologous to the nucleic acid molecule. The present invention also relates to methods of producing transgenic plants, polysaccharide depolymerizing the transgenic plants and non-transgenic plants, and identifying plants capable of undergoing enhanced polysaccharide depolymerization.",[Jocelyn Rose][Carmen Catala][Breeanna Urbanowicz],"[CORNELL RESEARCH FOUNDATION, INC]","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

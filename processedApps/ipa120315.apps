Radiation from the sample is directed onto a detector to diagnose or monitor the sample.","",[The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System],"This application is a divisional of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

13228947,20120315,20120065614,POLYIONIC TRANSITIONAL METAL PHOSPHORESCENT COMPLEX/POLYMER HYBRID SYSTEMS FOR BIOIMAGING AND SENSING APPLICATIONS,"A new technique to stabilize transition metal phosphors in a wide variety of stimuli-sensitive polymers and gels is disclosed herein. Other than stabilization in stimuli sensitive/biocompatible matrix some of these transition metal based phosphors are also shown to act as phosphorescent crosslinkers that physically or chemically crosslink polymeric chains to form micro/nanoparticles. The microspheres/nanospheres of the present invention show decreased size and photoluminescence enhancement with particularly high sensitization at physiological pH and temperature. The so formed phosphorescent micro/nanospheres are useful for biological or environmental applications including biological labeling, imaging, and optical sensing. The techniques in the present invention enable usage of imaging agents and sensors at very low concentrations and also minimize or eliminate the usage of toxic chemical crosslinkers typically used to synthesize polymeric micro/nanoparticles.","",[UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS],"This application is a non-provisional application of U.S. provisional patent application 61/381,928 filed on Sep. 10, 2010 and entitled &#x201C;Polyionic Transitional Metal Phosphorescent Complex/Polymer Hybrid Systems for Bioimaging and Sensing Applications&#x201D; which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",20110909,This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Grant Nos.

12882892,20120315,20120066690,System and Method Providing Run-Time Parallelization of Computer Software Using Data Associated Tokens,"A system and method of parallelizing programs assigns write tokens and read tokens to data objects accessed by computational operations. During run time, the write sets and read sets for computational operations are resolved and the computational operations executed only after they have obtained the necessary tokens for data objects corresponding to the resolved write and read sets. A data object may have unlimited read tokens but only a single write token and the write token may be released only if no read tokens are outstanding. Data objects provide a wait list which serves as an ordered queue for computational operations waiting for tokens.","","","",20100915,This invention was made with United States government support under grant number 0702313 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

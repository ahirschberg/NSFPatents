One of the cathodes is interposed between the anode and other cathode, and it includes a central opening which permits a microdischarge to occur between the anode and each cathode in response to applied voltage pulses from the drive circuit. Changes in relative current between the two cathodes are indicative of changes in ambient pressure in the microdischarge chamber. In other embodiments, a sealed chamber can be used with one of the electrodes acting as a diaphragm which deflects based on external pressure and changes its inter-electrode spacing, thereby altering the relative cathode currents.",[Yogesh Gianchandani][Scott Wright],[THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/183,056, filed Jun. 1, 2009, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",20100528,"This invention was made with government support under grants EEC0233187, EC9986866, and ECS0734962 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

The nanoparticles can be metal, metal alloy, metal mixture, intermetallic, metal-carbon, metal-ceramic, semiconductor-carbon, semiconductor-ceramic, insulator-carbon or insulator-ceramic nanoparticles, or combinations thereof. A block copolymer/ligand-stabilized nanoparticle solution is cast, resulting in the formation of a metal-rich (or semiconductor-rich or insulator-rich) mesostructured nanoparticle-block copolymer hybrid. The hybrid is heated to an elevated temperature, resulting in the formation of an ordered porous nanocomposite mesostructure. A nonmetal component (e.g., carbon or ceramic) is then removed to produce an ordered mesostructure with ordered and large uniform pores.","[Scott Warren][Ulrich Wiesner][Francis J.

13015333,20110602,20110131688,REGULATING THE ETHYLENE RESPONSE OF A PLANT BY MODULATION OF F-BOX PROTEINS,"The relationship between F-box proteins and proteins involved in the ethylene response in plants is described. In particular, F-box proteins may bind to proteins involved in the ethylene response and target them for degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The transcription factor EIN3 is a key transcription factor mediating ethylene-regulated gene expression and morphological responses. EIN3 is degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway mediated by F-box proteins EBF1 and EBF2. The link between F-box proteins and the ethylene response is a key step in modulating or regulating the response of a plant to ethylene. Described herein are transgenic plants having an altered sensitivity to ethylene, and methods for making transgenic plant having an altered sensitivity to ethylene by modulating the level of activity of F-box proteins. Methods of altering the ethylene response in a plant by modulating the activity or expression of an F-box protein are described. Also described are methods of identifying compounds that modulate the ethylene response in plants by modulating the level of F-box protein expression or activity.",[Hongwei Guo][Joseph R.

14064778,20140220,20140052686,"METHOD, SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT FOR RECONSTRUCTING FORMAL DESCRIPTIVE MODELS OF PROCESSES FROM FUNCTIONAL/MODAL DATA USING SUITABLE ONTOLOGY","A method, system and software arrangement in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention are provided to extract descriptive narrative from numerical experimental data augmented with ontological controlled vocabulary. One exemplary application of such system, method and software arrangement is in organizing gene-expression time course data in terms of biological processes that may be activated and deactivated as the biological system responds to its normal or perturbed environment. The present invention may also have biological applications to drug-or-vaccine discovery, understanding behavior of a cell in an altered diseased state (e.g., cancer, neuro-degeneration or auto-immune disease, etc.), genetically modifying a natural wild-type organism, genetic-engineering, etc. Other exemplary applications may include understanding neural behavior, market behavior of a population of users interacting on the Internet, etc.",[Bhubaneswar Mishra][Marco Antoniotti][Naren Ramakrishnan],[New York University],"The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

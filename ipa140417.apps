The spherical high dose volume created by the Gamma Knife unit will be viewed as a 3D spherical “paintbrush”, and treatment planning is reduced to finding the best route of this “paintbrush” to “paint” a 3D tumor volume. Under the dose-painting concept, Gamma Knife radiosurgery becomes dynamic, where the patient is moving continuously under the robotic positioning system.",[Shuang Luan][Nathan Swanson][Lijun Ma],[STC.UNM],"This application in a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser.

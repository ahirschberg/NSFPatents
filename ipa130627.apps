The method to develop SPA is based on the funneled energy landscape theory and employs affinity and specificity of biomolecular interactions. The quantified specificity of the native protein-ligand complex, which discriminates against “non-native” binding modes, and the affinity prediction are simultaneously optimized during the development. SPA is obtained by maximizing the specificity and affinity prediction of a large training set of “native” protein-ligand complexes with known structures and affinities. SPA can be employed to discriminate drugs from the diversity set, or to discriminate selective drugs from non-selective drugs. The remarkable performance of SPA makes it promising to be implemented in the docking software and widely applied in virtual screening for seeking the lead compounds.",[Zhiqiang Yan][Jin Wang],"","This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/579,891 filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Dec. 23, 2011.",20121220,This invention was made with government support under grant number MCB0947767 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

An example method includes receiving a set of moment and force input data from one or more identified topographies. The example method includes using a neural network to receive input from a training data set based on the first set of moment and force input data from the one or more identified topographies. Network weights to be used by the neural network to produce the training data set are modified via an evolutionary algorithm that tests vectors of candidate network weights. The example method includes receiving a moment and force input from a test object surface and reconstructing the surface topology based on the neural network outputs.",[Mitra J. Hartmann][Joseph H.

The captured data is provided to a streaming interface of a streaming service that encapsulates the captured data in streaming packets. The streaming interface provides the streaming packets to a streaming gateway of the streaming service that processes the streaming packets and transmits the streaming packets to a streaming gateway at the destination location. The streaming gateways manage the correlated streaming of the multiple data streams. Various processing of the data streams can be performed by the streaming gateways, including various user-defined and system-defined processing.",[Klara Nahrstedt][Pooja Argarwal][Raoul Vicente Rivas Toledano][Wanmin Wu][Md Ahsan Arefin][Zixia Huang],[The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois],"This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/503,312, filed Jun. 30, 2011, entitled &#x201C;SAS Kernel: Streaming as a Service Kernel for Correlated Multi-streaming&#x201D;, to Pooja Agarwal, et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",20120629,"This invention was made with government support under contract numbers NeTSE 1012194, NeTTS 0964081, CSR 0834480, and CSR 0720702 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

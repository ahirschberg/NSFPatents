One method includes using a genetic algorithm to determine a structure of a thermally-operated actuator. Another method includes receiving a three-dimensional model of a device, a design-rule set, and parameter ranges. Layout data are produced for devices having various combinations of parameter values in the parameter ranges.",[Jason V.

In the method, an indicator of an interaction by a user with a user interface window presented in a display of a computing device is received. The indicator indicates that a test model definition is created. A mapping window includes a first column and a second column. An event identifier is received in the first column and text mapped to the event identifier is received in the second column. The event identifier defines a transition included in the test model definition and the text defines code implementing a function of a system under test associated with the transition in the mapping window. A code window is presented in the display. Helper code text is received. The helper code text defines second code to generate executable code from the code implementing the function of the system under test. Executable test code is generated using the code implementing the function of the system under test and the second code.",[Dianxiang Xu],[],"",20120618,This invention was made with government support under CNS 0855106 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

07364675,20080429,Self-folding polymer microparticles,10700715,20040191321,20040930,A method for forming three-dimensional polymeric particulate microstructures through self-folding of thin-film microparticles. Self-folding of two-dimensional polymeric precursors produces various three-dimensional particulate microstructures. Dumpling-like microstructures with oil cores and polymer coats are prepared by an interfacial-tension driven self-folding method. Roll-like and bowl-shaped hydrogel microstructures are fabricated by self-folding induced by differential volume shrinkage. Curled microstructures are produced by self-folding that is the result of a two-polymer or bilayer method wherein one of the polymers is a volume changeable polymer.,[Jingjiao Guan][Derek J.

07364882,20080429,Enzymatic reduction of a nitrile containing compound to the corresponding amine,11235933,"","","A new class of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of a nitrile containing compound to the corresponding amine (such as a primary amine) are disclosed. Such enzymes are referred to herein as nitrile oxido-reductases. Methods of using the enzymes to reduce a nitrile to a amine, for example in vitro or in vivo, are provided. Such methods provide the first biocatalysis method for reducing nitrites to amines, and provides an alternative to currently used methods, which generally utilize harsh reaction conditions and the production of hazardous waste. While the hydrolysis of nitrites to amides and carboxylic acids via biocatalysis has found extensive use in industry, the lack of a known nitrile oxido-reductase has precluded the application of biocatalysis to nitrile reduction.",[Dirk Iwata-Reuyl][Val√©rie de Crecy-Lagard][Steven G.

Each of the clusters is then parameterized with texture coordinates, and texture is assigned to each of the clusters using the texture coordinates to result in a texture patch. The texture patches are then blended together.

07366645,20080429,"Method of recognition of human motion, vector sequences and speech",10427882,20030208289,20031106,"A method for recognition of an input human motion as being the most similar to one model human motion out of a collection of stored model human motions. In the preferred method, both the input and the model human motions are represented by vector sequences that are derived from samples of angular poses of body parts. The input and model motions are sampled at substantially different rates. A special optimization algorithm that employs sequencing constraints and dynamic programming, is used for finding the optimal input-model matching scores. When only partial body pose information is available, candidate matching vector pairs for the optimization are found by indexing into a set of hash tables, where each table pertains to a sub-set of body parts. The invention also includes methods for recognition of vector sequences and for speech recognition.",[Jezekiel Ben-Arie],[],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/378,316 filed May 6, 2002.

07730813,20100608,Variable tuned holder for machine tools,11571788,20080298912,20081204,"A variable tuned holder for machine tools that attaches to a machine tool to act in a manner similar to a dynamic absorber while the machine tool is used during machining. The natural frequency of the holder may be matched to the natural frequency of the machine tool as the tool is in use to reduce the amplitude of vibration at the cutting end of tool with a workpiece. The present invention is designed to provide an impedance match between the machine tool and the holder such that the cutting energy may escape and/or be dissipated. The flexible holder may be used as one part of an overall system. The system may be designed to be used with tools of different shapes and/or lengths. As the shape and/or length of the machine tool changes, the system may be easily modified to change the natural frequency of the flexible holder to enable the dynamic absorber effect of the flexible holder to occur. The flexible holder may be included in a kit that may be used with a wide range of lengths and/or shapes of machine tools.","[Tony L. Schmitz][Lonnie A. Houck, III][Brian P. Mann][Kevin S.

07733479,20100608,Charged carbon nanotubes for use as sensors,11443341,20070116628,20070524,"The invention relates to charged single-wall carbon nanotubes and their use in sensing and monitoring devices. The charged single-wall carbon nanotubes, have been found to have spectral shifts in certain regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The charged single wall nanotubes are very sensitive to environmental perturbations and the nanotube's optical properties will be affected by these perturbations. Accordingly, the charged single wall carbon nanotubes can be used as sensors for a wide variety of applications, such as salt concentrations and pH, signal generators, measuring length of DNA molecules, as well as optical tags for biological detection and mapping of malignant cell activity. Optimal sensor devices are achieved in the present invention when the charged single-wall carbon nanotube carries a linear charge density close to that of DNA. The invention further describes an optical pH sensor comprising at least one charged carbon nanotube in solution.",[Chwen-Yang Shew][Godfrey Gumbs][Takafumi Iwaki],"","This application claims the priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. section 119 of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/685,770 entitled &#x201C;Use of Charged Carbon Nanotubes as an Optical Probe of Salt Concentration in Solutions and Related Sensors&#x201D; filed Jun. 1, 2005, which is in its entirety herein incorporated by reference.",20060531,This invention was partially sponsored by the National Science Foundation Grant No. PHY99-07949 and the National Institutes of Health Grant No. 4137308-04.

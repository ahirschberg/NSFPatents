07387027,20080617,Characterization of materials with optically shaped acoustic waveforms,11186401,20060027021,20060209,"A method for characterizing one or more properties of a sample using acoustic waveforms is disclosed, and comprises directing a sequence of at least three optical pulses to the sample to generate an acoustic response in the sample at a frequency corresponding to the pulse sequence, varying the timing of one or more of the pulses in the sequence to vary the frequency of the acoustic response in the sample, and measuring the strength of the acoustic response as a function of the varied frequency to determine information about the sample.",[Jaime D. Choi][Benjamin Paxton][Thomas Feurer][Masashi Yamaguchi][Keith A. Nelson],[Massachusetts Institute of Technology],"This application claims priority to U.S. Application Ser. No. 60/590,684 entitled &#x201C;Characterization of Materials with Optically Shaped Acoustic Waveforms&#x201D;, filed on Jul. 23, 2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",20050721,This invention was made with Government support under NSF CHE-0212375 and DOE DE-FG02-00ER15087.

07387846,20080617,Electrolytic deposition of coatings for prosthetic metals and alloys,11254710,20060099456,20060511,An article coated with an electrolytically deposited bio-compatible composite layer useful as an internal prosthetic device is disclosed. The bio-compatible composite coating that is electrolytically deposited onto the article comprises hydroxyapatite and chitosan. The introduction of chitosan into the crystal matrix of brushite/hydroxyapatite significantly improves the adhesive and chemical and mechanical stability properties of the coating.,[Jody G. Redepenning],[Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska],"This application is a Divisional of Ser. No. 10/034,805 filed Dec. 27, 2001 now U.S. Pat.

07387888,20080617,Coronamycins,11064486,20050260182,20051124,"The present invention relates to isolated strains of a spp. which are endophytes of dicotyledonous plants and to methods for selecting such strains. The present invention also relates to a biologically active compound called coronamycin obtained from endophytic Streptomycetes isolated from higher plants. The present invention further relates to compositions of such compounds and to methods of protecting plants against attack by a plant pathogen and methods of inhibiting bacterial growth, fungal growth, viral infection, growth of parasitic organisms, and cancer cell growth with such compositions.",[Gary A. Strobel][Debbie S. Yaver][Uvidelio F. Castillo][David Ezra],[Montana State University][Novozymes Biotech Inc.],"This application claims priority to Provisional Application 60/546,964, filed Feb. 24, 2004, which is hereby specifically incorporated by reference in its entirety.",20050224,"This invention was partially made with government support under Vaadia-BARD post doctoral award No. FI-321-2001 from the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund and with funds from the United States National Science Foundation, grant No. 0244206.

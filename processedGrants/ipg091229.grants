07637960,20091229,Short and thin silicon cantilever with tip and fabrication thereof,11599726,20070125160,20070607,"Thin and short cantilevers possess both a low force constant and a high resonance frequency, thus are highly desirable for atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging and force measurement. According to some embodiments, the invention provides small silicon (Si) cantilevers integrated with a Si tip, for example fabricated from SOI wafers that are used for reducing the variation of thickness of the cantilevers. In one example, the fabrication process provided SOI chips containing 40 silicon cantilevers integrating with an ultra-sharp Si tip. The resolution of images obtained with these tips was much higher than those obtained with the commercial tips, while the force constants were much less, that is, more suitable for imaging soft samples. The availability of such SOI chips greatly facilitates large scale modification of the surfaces of the silicon cantilever tips with a monolayer of oligo(ethylene glycol) derivatives that resist the non-specific interactions with proteins, rendering them most suitable for imaging and measurement of biological samples.",[Chengzhi Cai][Chi-Ming Yam][Guoting Qin][Steven Pei][Qingkai Yu],[University of Houston],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/736,924, filed Nov. 15, 2005.

07639739,20091229,Technique to enable efficient adaptive streaming and transcoding of video and other signals,10286364,20030099298,20030529,"A method is described for efficiently determining total end-to-end distortion of a pre-compressed data stream, such as video streams or other media streams, at the time of delivery over a lossy-network, and for providing adaptive error-resilient delivery schemes based on distortion estimates. The methods can be utilized with single or multilayer packet streams and are particularly well suited for video streams. By way of example, distortion estimates are performed by generating side-information at the time of data stream compression, wherein the side-information is used in conjunction with information about the network status to determine an estimated distortion for the group of packets when the data stream is transported over the network to a destination end. This estimation may be utilized within described resiliency techniques in which the error correction mechanism is selected in response to the estimated distortion, which may be additionally refined in reference to cost factors.",[Kenneth Rose][Rui Zhang][Shankar Regunathan],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims priority from U.S. provisional application Ser.

07609220,20091027,Channelized log-periodic antenna with matched coupling,11430524,20060262023,20061123,A log-periodic antenna coupled to a channelizer is described in which matched scale constants for the antenna and the channelizer are used to achieve substantially identical coupling over each fractional bandwidth channel. Embodiments for simultaneous dual polarization operation are described as well as embodiments suited for planar lithographic fabrication.,[Gregory Engargiola][Adrian Lee],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims priority pursuant to 35 USC &#xA7; 119 from provisional patent application Ser.

07609392,20091027,Harmonically matched diffraction grating pair,11770553,20080002209,20080103,"A method and device realize shallow gratings-based planar beam splitter/combiner. Non-trivial phase shifts between different ports of resulting interferometers are used to acquire full-field phase measurements. The non-trivial phase shifts between different ports of the planar beam splitter/combiner can be adjusted by simply shearing one grating with respect to the second grating. The two shallow diffraction gratings are harmonically-related and can be recorded on a single substrate for compact interferometric based schemes. During the recording process, the two gratings are aligned such that the grating planes and the grating vectors are parallel to that of each other. The relative phase of the recording beams controls the shearing between the recorded harmonically-related shallow phase gratings. The relative shearing of the two gratings defines the non-trivial phase shift between different ports of the compact planar beam splitter/combiner.",[Zahid Yaqoob][Jigang Wu][Marinko Sarunic][Changhuei Yang],[California Institute of Technology],"This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C.

07609782,20091027,Space-time coded transmissions within a wireless communication network,11682664,20080037685,20080214,"Techniques are described for space-time block coding for single-carrier block transmissions over frequency selective multipath fading channels. Techniques are described that achieve a maximum diversity of order NN(L+1) in rich scattering environments, where N(N) is the number of transmit (receive) antennas, and L is the order of the finite impulse response (FIR) channels. The techniques may include parsing a stream of information-bearing symbols to form blocks of K symbols, precoding the symbols to form blocks having J symbols, and collecting consecutive Nblocks. The techniques may further include applying a permutation matrix to the Nblocks, generating a space-time block coded matrix having Nrows that are communicated through a wireless communication medium. The receiver complexity is comparable to single antenna transmissions, and the exact Viterbi's algorithm can be applied for maximum-likelihood (ML) optimal decoding.",[Georgios B.

Greater than 2×10soft x-ray laser pulses were obtained using a single target. Similar results were obtained at 13.2 nm for Ni-like Cd using a cadmium-coated target. Uninterrupted operation of laser-pumped soft x-ray lasers at a repetition rates of about 10 Hz for periods of several hours enables the generation of pulsed, high average power soft x-rays for applications. Other embodiments of the renewable laser target are described.",[Jorge J.

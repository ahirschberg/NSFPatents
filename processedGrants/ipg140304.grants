A method for secure communication includes: encoding a message with an NS ECC to produce an encoded message carrying no message bits in the clear; and transmitting the encoded message over a main channel (). The NS ECC characteristics result in an eavesdropper channel error probability under a security threshold () and a main channel error probability over a reliability threshold (), whenever an eavesdropper () listening on an eavesdropper channel () is more than distance Z () from the transmitter. Unreliable bits in the encoded bits render the eavesdropper unable to reliably decode messages on the main channel.",[Steven William McLaughlin][Demijan Klinc][Jeongseok Ha],[Georgia Tech Research Corporation][Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)],"This application is a co-pending application which claims priority to PCT Application No. PCT/US2009/59974, filed, 8 Oct. 2009, entitled &#x201C;Secure Communication Using Non-Systematic Error Control Codes&#x201D; which claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61/103,951, filed on 9 Oct. 2008 each of these applications being incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.",20091008,"This invention was made with Government support under Agreement/Contract Number CCF-0634952, awarded by National Science Foundation.

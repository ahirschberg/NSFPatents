New methods based on this discovery include removing viruses from liquids such as blood or plasma, removing viruses from pharmaceuticals, concentrating and/or purifying viruses, e.g., for use in gene therapy, and producing recombinant viruses in new bioreactors. The invention also includes new methods of therapy or adjunct therapy for viral infections, in which a patient's blood or plasma is filtered through the membranes to remove viruses to reduce the viral load. The invention also includes new bioreactors and viral filters containing the membranes.",[William Lee][Jeffrey R. Morgan][Martin L.

07160531,20070109,Process for the continuous production of aligned carbon nanotubes,10141423,"","","Novel methods and apparati for continuous production of aligned carbon nanotubes are disclosed. In one aspect, the method comprises dispersion of a metal catalyst in a liquid hydrocarbon to form a feed solution, and volatilizing the feed solution in a reactor through which a substrate is continuously passed to allow growth of nanotubes thereon. In another aspect, the apparatus comprises a reactor, a tube-within-a-tube injector, and a conveyor belt for passing a substrate through the reactor. The present invention further discloses a method for restricting the external diameter of carbon nanotubes produced thereby comprising passing the feed solution through injector tubing of a specified diameter, followed by passing the feed solution through an inert, porous medium. The method and apparati of this invention provide a means for producing aligned carbon nanotubes of a particular external diameter which is suitable for large scale production in an industrial setting.",[David N.

07160575,20070109,Conducting polymer,10771752,"","","Measurement in the frequency range 3 mHz–106 Hz of the dielectric characteristics of emeraldine base polyaniline dissolved in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and cast into bulk free-standing polymer films shows features similar to those reported by others and which are a result of microphase separation into reduced and oxidized repeat units. However, upon confinement into the cylindrical pores, of average diameter 20 nm, of a porous membrane such features of microphase separation do not occur. The microphase separation observed in the bulk polymer is suppressed by strong pinning of the charge carriers due to interactions of the polymer with pore walls together with constrained chain packing and a non-uniform rate of evaporation of the NMP solvent from the pores. This enhances the bulk conductivity after doping by reducing the internal intra-chain disorder introduced by microphase separation.",[Nicholas J. Pinto][Fouad M.

The microfluidic matrix device offers a solution to the “world-to-chip” interface problem by accomplishing two important goals simultaneously: an economy of scale in reagent consumption is achieved, while simultaneously minimizing pipetting steps. Nindependent assays can be performed with only 2N+1 pipetting steps, using a single aliquot of enzyme amortized over all reactors. The chip reduces labor relative to conventional fluid handling techniques by using an order of magnitude less pipetting steps, and reduces cost by consuming two to three orders of magnitude less reagents per reaction. A PCR format has immediate applications in medical diagnosis and gene testing. Beyond PCR, the microfluidic matrix chip provides a universal and flexible platform for biological and chemical assays requiring parsimonious use of precious reagents and highly automated processing.",[Jian Liu][Carl L.

07414549,20080819,Wyner-Ziv coding based on TCQ and LDPC codes,11499601,"","","An encoder employs a trellis coded quantization (TCQ) unit and a compression unit. The TCQ uses a set of polynomials that have been selected to maximize granular gain. The TCQ unit operates on a block of samples from a source. The compression unit compresses bit planes of the TCQ output, using parity check matrices of corresponding LDPC codes, to obtain corresponding syndromes. The parity check matrices are selected so their compression performance approaches close to the limit for Slepian-Wolf coding. A decoder employs a decoding unit and an estimation unit. The decoding unit decodes the syndromes using side information to produce an estimate for the TCQ output. The side information is correlated with the source. The estimation unit estimates the block of source samples using the estimated TCQ output and the side information.

Instances of each of the subshapes are individually located in the design shape and then reconstructed to form an instance of the entire shape. The basis for the hierarchy of subshapes can be specified by the designer or based on the default parameter relations that come from architectural and engineering knowledge. The levels of the hierarchy are defined so that the most constrained lines of a shape are those lines that the designer intended exactly. These most constrained lines have specified parametric relations to other line segments and those relations, if altered, will compromise the designer's intentions. Conversely, the lowest level of the hierarchy, which contains the least constrained line segments, only implies a specific connectivity between line segments, necessitating a vaster search. The parametric recognition of curved line shapes used a two-step approach that first performs shape matching with an equivalent straight-line shape then checks those transformations for matching with the actual curved lines. This approach has advantages characteristic polygons as well as emergent shapes.",[Jay P.

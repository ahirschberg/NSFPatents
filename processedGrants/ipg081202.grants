07458661,20081202,Method and apparatus for promoting the complete transfer of liquid drops from a nozzle,11275668,20060164490,20060727,"A printhead device for transferring liquid droplets from a nozzle includes a liquid source coupled to a nozzle via a microchannel. The nozzle is formed from an orifice having an inner circumferential surface, wherein at least a portion of the inner circumferential surface is serrated. Liquid droplets are transported from the source to the nozzle using a liquid droplet driver (e.g., employing a plurality of driving electrodes). Transfer of droplets to another surface can be accomplished by contacting a bulging droplet in the nozzle with a printing surface. The surface and/or nozzle are then moved relative to one another to effectuate complete transfer of the liquid drop from the nozzle.",[Chang-Jin Kim][Uichong Brandon Yi],[The Regents of the University of California],"This Application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/647,130 filed on Jan. 25, 2005.

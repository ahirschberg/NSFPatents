One embodiment of such a method comprises providing a storage apparatus having a substrate and a nanostructure mat on at least a portion of a side of the substrate. The nanostructure mat comprises a plurality of nanostructures having a surface ionization state which causes more than one layer of hydrogen to adsorb onto the nanostructures. The method can also include exposing the nanostructure mat to hydrogen such that more than one layer of hydrogen adsorbs onto the nanostructures.,[Grant Norton][David McIIRoy],"[Washington State University Research Foundation][Idaho Research Foundation, Inc.]","The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/876,646, filed on Dec. 22, 2006, and the present application is a continuation-in-part of International Application No. PCT/US06/024435, filed on Jun. 23, 2006, and entitled Method for Manufacturing and Coating of Nanostructured Components, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/744,733 filed on Apr. 12, 2006 and 60/693,683 filed on Jun. 24, 2005, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.",20071220,"The invention was funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation under Idaho EPSToR grant EPS0132626.

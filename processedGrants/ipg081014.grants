The design eliminates the need for a mechanical membrane, such as a polyelectrolyte membrane (PEM) in a fuel cell, by providing a flow channel in which laminar flow regimes exist in two fluids flowing in mutual contact to form a “virtual interface” in the flow channel. In the flow cell, diffusion at the interface is the only mode of mass transport between the two fluids. In a fuel cell embodiment, a planar design provides to large contact areas between the two streams, which are fuel and oxidant streams, and between each stream and a respective electrode. In some embodiments, silicon microchannels, of fixed length and variable width and height, have been used to generate power using formic acid as fuel and oxygen as oxidant.

07436175,20081014,Practical pulse synthesis via the discrete inverse scattering transform,10538361,20060113994,20060601,"The discrete inverse scattering (DIST) approach is used to design selective RF pulses. As in SLR, a hard pulse approximation is used to actually design the pulse. Unlike SLR, the pulse is designed using the full inverse scattering data (the reflection coefficient and the bound states) rather than the flip angle profile. The reflection coefficient is approximated in order to obtain a pulse with a prescribed rephasing time. In contrast to the SLR approach, direct control on the phase of the magnetization profile is retained throughout the design process. Explicit recursive algorithms are provided for computing the hard pulse from the inverse scattering data. These algorithms are essentially discretizations of the Marchenko equations. When bound states are present, both the left and right Marchenko equations are used in order to improve the numerical stability of the algorithm. The DIST algorithm is used in preferred applications to generate pulses for use in magnetic resonance imaging, although it has applications in other two-level quantum systems such as quantum computing and spintronics.",[Charles L Epstein][Jeremy Magland],[The Trustees of The University of Pennsylvania],"This application is the National Stage of International Application No. PCT/US2003/039714, filed December 12, 2003, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional Application No. 60/433,407, filed December 13, 2002, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",20031212,The present invention was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

The optical mask has been designed to cause the optical transfer function to remain essentially constant within some range from the in-focus position. Signal processing of the resulting intermediate image undoes the optical transfer modifying effects of the mask, resulting in an in-focus image over an increased depth of field.

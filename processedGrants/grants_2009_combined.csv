Instances of each of the subshapes are individually located in the design shape and then reconstructed to form an instance of the entire shape. The basis for the hierarchy of subshapes can be specified by the designer or based on the default parameter relations that come from architectural and engineering knowledge. The levels of the hierarchy are defined so that the most constrained lines of a shape are those lines that the designer intended exactly. These most constrained lines have specified parametric relations to other line segments and those relations, if altered, will compromise the designer's intentions. Conversely, the lowest level of the hierarchy, which contains the least constrained line segments, only implies a specific connectivity between line segments, necessitating a vaster search. The parametric recognition of curved line shapes uses a two-step approach that first performs shape matching with an equivalent straight-line shape then checks those transformations for matching with the actual curved lines.

In an embodiment, a data structure called BOB (binary tree on binary tree) for dynamic router tables in which the rule filters are nonintersecting ranges and in which ties are broken by selecting the highest-priority rule that matches a destination address is disclosed. Prefix filters are a special case of nonintersecting ranges and the commonly used longest-prefix tie breaker is a special case of the highest-priority tie breaker. When an n-rule router table is represented using BOB, the highest-priority rule that matches a destination address may be found in O(logn) time; a new rule maybe inserted and an old one deleted in O(log n) time. For the case when all rule filters are prefixes, the data structure PBOB (prefix BOB) permits highest-priority matching as well as rule insertion and deletion in O(W) time, where W is the length of the longest prefix, each. When all rule filters are prefixes and longest-prefix matching is to be done, the data structures LMPBOB (longest matching-prefix BOB) permits longest-prefix matching in O(W) time; rule insertion and deletion each take O(log n) time.

According to some embodiments, the invention provides small silicon (Si) cantilevers integrated with a Si tip, for example fabricated from SOI wafers that are used for reducing the variation of thickness of the cantilevers. In one example, the fabrication process provided SOI chips containing 40 silicon cantilevers integrating with an ultra-sharp Si tip. The resolution of images obtained with these tips was much higher than those obtained with the commercial tips, while the force constants were much less, that is, more suitable for imaging soft samples. The availability of such SOI chips greatly facilitates large scale modification of the surfaces of the silicon cantilever tips with a monolayer of oligo(ethylene glycol) derivatives that resist the non-specific interactions with proteins, rendering them most suitable for imaging and measurement of biological samples.",[Chengzhi Cai][Chi-Ming Yam][Guoting Qin][Steven Pei][Qingkai Yu],[University of Houston],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/736,924, filed Nov. 15, 2005.

07639739,20091229,Technique to enable efficient adaptive streaming and transcoding of video and other signals,10286364,20030099298,20030529,"A method is described for efficiently determining total end-to-end distortion of a pre-compressed data stream, such as video streams or other media streams, at the time of delivery over a lossy-network, and for providing adaptive error-resilient delivery schemes based on distortion estimates. The methods can be utilized with single or multilayer packet streams and are particularly well suited for video streams. By way of example, distortion estimates are performed by generating side-information at the time of data stream compression, wherein the side-information is used in conjunction with information about the network status to determine an estimated distortion for the group of packets when the data stream is transported over the network to a destination end. This estimation may be utilized within described resiliency techniques in which the error correction mechanism is selected in response to the estimated distortion, which may be additionally refined in reference to cost factors.",[Kenneth Rose][Rui Zhang][Shankar Regunathan],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims priority from U.S. provisional application Ser.

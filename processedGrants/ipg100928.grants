07802426,20100928,System and method for rapid isothermal gas expansion and compression for energy storage,12481235,20090301089,20091210,The invention relates to systems and methods for rapidly and isothermally expanding gas in a cylinder. The cylinder is used in a staged hydraulic-pneumatic energy conversion system and includes a gas chamber (pneumatic side) and a fluid chamber (hydraulic side) and a piston or other mechanism that separates the gas chamber and fluid chamber while allowing the transfer of force/pressure between each opposing chamber. The gas chamber of the cylinder includes ports that are coupled to a heat transfer subassembly that circulates gas from the pneumatic side and exchanges its heat with a counter flow of ambient temperature fluid from a reservoir or other source.,[Benjamin R.

07803542,20100928,"Signal-on architecture for electronic, oligonucleotide-based detectors",11564674,20070154909,20070705,"The invention provides a general “signal-on” architecture for oligonucleotide-based detectors that leads to order of magnitude increases in signal gain and sensitivity as compared to prior art detectors. The detectors of the invention rely on base pairing between two oligonucleotide strands, the sensor strand and the blocker strand. In the ‘off’ position of the detector, i.e., in the absence of target, the blocker strand and sensor strand are base-paired. As shown in FIG. , the formation of comparatively rigid, duplex DNA prevents the redox moiety from approaching the electrode surface, thereby suppressing Faradaic currents. When target is added to the system, the target displaces the blocker strand, binds to the sensor strand, liberating the end of the redox-labeled oligonucleotide to produce a flexible element. This, in turn, allows the redox moiety to collide with the electrode surface, producing a readily detectable Faradaic current.",[Yi Xiao][Arica Lubin][Kevin Plaxco],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser.

The resulting snapshots provide key information about the spatial distribution of the aerosol introduced by direct and indirect injection devices: 1) a direct injection high efficiency nebulizer (DIHEN); 2) a large-bore DIHEN (LB-DIHEN); and 3) a PFA microflow nebulizer with a PFA Scott-type spray chamber. Moreover, particle image velocimetry (PIV) is used to study the in-situ behavior of the aerosol before interaction with, for example, plasma, while the individual surviving droplets are explored by particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). Further, the velocity distribution of the surviving droplets demonstrates the importance of the initial droplet velocities in complete desolvation of the aerosol for optimum analytical performance in ICP spectrometries. These new observations are important in the design of the next-generation direct injection devices for lower sample consumption, higher sensitivity, lower noise levels, suppressed matrix effects, and for developing smart spectrometers.

The bridge can then be balanced by addition of capacitance in parallel with the parasitic capacitance of a respective portion of the power supply circuit or dividing the split inductor such that a ratio of inductances of respective portions of the split inductor approximates a ratio of parasitic capacitances of the respective power supply circuit portions which may be measured or otherwise empirically determined. CM noise reduction of up to 40 db can be achieved without symmetric circuit design, addition of circuit elements or complex filtering having added cost, space requirements and power losses. Further, such a reduction in common mode noise allows simple EMI filtering arrangements to be employed further reducing cost and space requirements for the power supply circuit.",[Shuo Wang][Fred Lee][Pengju Kong],"[Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties, Inc.]","",20060913,This invention was made in connection with National Science Foundation Contract EEC-9731677.

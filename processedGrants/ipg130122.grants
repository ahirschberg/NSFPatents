08357308,20130122,Ion etching of growing InP nanocrystals using microwave,12201589,"","","High quantum yield InP nanocrystals are used in the bio-technology, bio-medical, and photovoltaic, specifically IV, III-V and III-VI nanocrystal technological applications. InP nanocrystals typically require post-generation HF treatment. Combining microwave methodologies with the presence of a fluorinated ionic liquid allows Fluorine ion etching without the hazards accompanying HF. Growing the InP nanocrystals in the presence of the ionic liquid allows in-situ etching to be achieved. The optimization of the PL QY is achieved by balancing growth and etching rates in the reaction.",[Geoffrey F. Strouse][Derek D.

According to an example embodiment of the present invention, a digital imaging arrangement implements microlenses to direct light to photosensors that detect the light and generate data corresponding to the detected light. The generated data is used to compute an output image, where each output image pixel value corresponds to a selective weighting and summation of a subset of the detected photosensor values. The weighting is a function of characteristics of the imaging arrangement. In some applications, the weighting reduces the contribution of data from photosensors that contribute higher amounts of optical aberration to the corresponding output image pixel.",[Yi-Ren Ng][Patrick M.

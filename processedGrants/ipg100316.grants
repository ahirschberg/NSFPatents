07676903,20100316,Microelectromechanical slow-wave phase shifter method of use,11782821,"","","/The present invention provides a method of use for a monolithic device utilizing cascaded, switchable slow-wave CPW sections that are integrated along the length of a planar transmission line. The purpose of the switchable slow-wave CPW sections element is to enable control of the propagation constant along the transmission line while maintaining a quasi-constant characteristic impedance. The method can be used to produce true time delay phase shifting components in which large amounts of time delay can be achieved without significant variation in the effective characteristic impedance of the transmission line, and thus also the input/output return loss of the component. Additionally, for a particular value of return loss, greater time delay per unit length can be achieved in comparison to tunable capacitance-only delay components.",[Thomas Weller][Balaji Lakshminarayanan],[University of South Florida],"This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser.

Lipids and pore forming templates are dissolved into a first solution. The solvent is removed thereby creating a lipid bilayer with pore forming templates dispersed throughout. The bilayer is hydrated and monomers and crosslinkers are added to create a second solution. A nanothin film with pore forming templates is created through polymerization of said second solution. The pore forming templates are dissolved into a third solution by addition of a chemical in which the pore forming template is soluble, but the lipid bilayer is insoluble.

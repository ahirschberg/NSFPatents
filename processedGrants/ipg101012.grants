07810704,20101012,Method for fabricating large dimension bonds using reactive multilayer joining,12103484,20080299410,20081204,"A method for joining component bodies of material over bonding regions of large dimensions by disposing a plurality of substantially contiguous sheets of reactive composite materials between the bodies and adjacent sheets of fusible material. The contiguous sheets of the reactive composite material are operatively connected by an ignitable bridging material so that an igniting reaction in one sheet will cause an igniting reaction in the other. An application of uniform pressure and an ignition of one or more of the contiguous sheets of reactive composite material causes an exothermic thermal reaction to propagate through the bonding region, fusing any adjacent sheets of fusible material and forming a bond between the component bodies.",[Alan Duckham][Jesse E.

07811543,20101012,Controlled synthesis of nanoparticles using continuous liquid-flow aerosol method,12287530,20100028249,20100204,"A method and apparatus for producing surface stabilized nanometer-sized particles includes the steps of mixing reactants, a surface-stabilizing surfactant, and a high boiling point liquid to form a mixture, continuously passing the mixture through an ultrasonic spray nozzle to form a mist of droplets of the mixture, injecting the mist directly into a furnace to cause a reaction between species of the mixture, and collecting the nanometer-sized products. The ultrasonic nozzle is positioned directly at one end of the heating furnace, preferably the top end, for travel of the droplets through the furnace.

A cylindrically-focused second light beam interrogates a target that is optically interactive with a frequency-dispersed excitation (first light) pulse, whereupon the second light beam is frequency-dispersed at right angle orientation to its line of focus, so that the horizontal dimension encodes the spatial location of the second light pulse and the first light frequency, while the vertical dimension encodes the second light frequency. Differential spectra of the first and second light pulses result in a 2D frequency-frequency surface equivalent to double-resonance spectroscopy. Because the first light frequency is spatially encoded in the sample, an entire surface can be acquired in a single interaction of the first and second light pulses.",[Matthew F.

In one embodiment, a tethered capsule with a scanning optical fiber provides the images, although other types of endoscopic cameras can instead be used. A surface model of the lumen and camera pose estimates for each image or frame are required for this task. Camera pose parameters, which define camera alignment, are determined for six degrees-of-freedom. The size of each frame projected as a strip on the surface model depends on the longitudinal movement of the camera.

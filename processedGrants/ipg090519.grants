The porosity of the cell growth matrix may be modified by the selection of particles of appropriate diameter. Further, the surface of colloidal crystals can be easily modified to accommodate many organic species including biomolecules. Layer-by-layer materials are used for tissue engineering to control cell development by using sequential layering of bioactive species wherein the number and order of LBL layers deposited between layers containing a particular protein are controlled. LBL may also be used for timed release of bioactive species. Increased control differentiation factors release and control of cell attachments to the scaffold are achieved to better mimic natural tissue development.",[Nicholas A.

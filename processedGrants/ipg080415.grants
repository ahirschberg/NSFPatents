07357836,20080415,Crystalline membranes,10794483,20050014371,20050120,"In certain aspects, the invention features methods for forming crystalline membranes (e.g., a membrane of a framework material, such as a zeolite) by inducing secondary growth in a layer of oriented seed crystals. The rate of growth of the seed crystals in the plane of the substrate is controlled to be comparable to the rate of growth out of the plane. As a result, a crystalline membrane can form a substantially continuous layer including grains of uniform crystallographic orientation that extend through the depth of the layer.",[Michael Tsapatsis][Zhiping Lai],[University of Massachusetts],"This application claims priority from Provisional Patent Application No. 60/452,375, entitled &#x201C;CRYSTALLINE MEMBRANES,&#x201D; filed on Mar. 6, 2003, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference.",20040305,"This invention was made with Government support under grant numbers CTS-0091406 and CTS-0103010 awarded by the National Science Foundation, and grant number NAG8-1697 awarded by NASA.

07358318,20080415,"Organo-ceramic composite materials, their use as adsorbents, and methods of making the same",09573304,"","","The present invention relates to an organo-ceramic composite material useful for the extraction of metal ions from solution. The organo-ceramic composite material is formed according to a sol gel synthesis scheme by reacting a functional precursor silane and its homopolymers with either (i) a mixture of a cross-linking silane and its homopolymers or (ii) the cross-linking silane, under conditions effective to yield the composite material of the present invention. Further aspects of the present invention relate to methods of removing a metal ion from a water stream and recovering a metal ion from a water stream, both of which include contacting a water stream containing a metal ion with an organo-ceramic composite material of the present invention under conditions effective to remove the metal ion from the water stream.",[Lawrence L. Tavlarides][Nandu V. Deorkar][Jun-Sig Lee],[Syracuse University],"The present application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

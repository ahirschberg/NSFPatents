In its principle, the temporal order of base additions during the polymerization reaction is measured on a molecule of nucleic acid, i.e. the activity of a nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme on the template nucleic acid molecule to be sequenced is followed in real time. The sequence is deduced by identifying which base is being incorporated into the growing complementary strand of the target nucleic acid by the catalytic activity of the nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme at each step in the sequence of base additions. A polymerase on the target nucleic acid molecule complex is provided in a position suitable to move along the target nucleic acid molecule and extend the oligonucleotide primer at an active site. A plurality of labelled types of nucleotide analogs are provided proximate to the active site, with each distinguishable type of nucleotide analog being complementary to a different nucleotide in the target nucleic acid sequence. The growing nucleic acid strand is extended by using the polymerase to add a nucleotide analog to the nucleic acid strand at the active site, where the nucleotide analog being added is complementary to the nucleotide of the target nucleic acid at the active site. The nucleotide analog added to the oligonucleotide primer as a result of the polymerizing step is identified. The steps of providing labelled nucleotide analogs, polymerizing the growing nucleic acid strand, and identifying the added nucleotide analog are repeated so that the nucleic acid strand is further extended and the sequence of the target nucleic acid is determined.",[Jonas Korlach][Watt W.

The TCQ uses a set of polynomials that have been selected to maximize granular gain. The TCQ unit operates on a block of samples from a source. The compression unit compresses bit planes of the TCQ output, using parity check matrices of corresponding LDPC codes, to obtain corresponding syndromes. The parity check matrices are selected so their compression performance approaches close to the limit for Slepian-Wolf coding. A decoder employs a decoding unit and an estimation unit. The decoding unit decodes the syndromes using side information to produce an estimate for the TCQ output. The side information is correlated with the source.

The basis for the hierarchy of subshapes can be specified by the designer or based on the default parameter relations that come from architectural and engineering knowledge. The levels of the hierarchy are defined so that the most constrained lines of a shape are those lines that the designer intended exactly. These most constrained lines have specified parametric relations to other line segments and those relations, if altered, will compromise the designer's intentions. Conversely, the lowest level of the hierarchy, which contains the least constrained line segments, only implies a specific connectivity between line segments, necessitating a vaster search.

Because of the unique arrangement of wires, these crystalline networks defined as “nanowebs”, “nanowire networks”, and/or “two-dimensional nanowires”. Nanowebs contain wire densities on the order of 10/cm. A possible mechanism for the fast self-assembly of crystalline metal oxide nanowires involves multiple nucleation and coalescence via oxidation-reduction reactions at the molecular level. The preferential growth of nanowires parallel to the substrate enables them to coalesce into regular polygonal networks. The individual segments of the polygonal network consist of both nanowires and nanotubules of β-gallium oxide. The synthesis of highly crystalline noncatalytic low melting metals such as β-gallium oxide tubes, nanowires, and nanopaintbrushes is accomplished using molten gallium and microwave plasma containing a mixture of monoatomic oxygen and hydrogen. Gallium oxide nanowires were 20-100 nm thick and tens to hundreds of microns long. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the nanowires to be highly crystalline and devoid of any structural defects. Results showed that multiple nucleation and growth of gallium oxide nanostructures can occur directly out of molten gallium exposed to appropriate composition of hydrogen and oxygen in the gas phase. The method of producing nanowebs is extendible to other low melting metals and their oxides such as for example: zinc oxide, tin oxide, aluminum oxide, bismuth oxide, and titanium dioxide.",[Mahendra Kumar Sunkara][Shashank Sharma][Burtron H.

The apparatus includes a plurality of three-dimensional (3D) memory units; at least one pixel bus for providing global horizontal communication; a plurality of rendering pipelines; at least one geometry bus; and a control unit. The apparatus includes a block processor having a circular ray integration pipeline for processing voxel data and ray data. Rays are generally processed in image order thus permitting great flexibility (e.g., perspective projection, global illumination). The block processor includes a splatting unit and a scattering unit. A method for casting shadows and performing global illumination in relation to light sources includes sweeping a two dimensional array of rays through the volume can also be implemented with the apparatus. A method for approximating a perspective projection includes using parallel projection.",[Arie E.

Further, a “super-unified” space-time code construction is developed that incorporates multi-radii AM-PSK codes with the Lu-Kumar unified codes. The multi-radii space-time codes achieve the rate-diversity tradeoff—that is, the codes transmits information at the maximum rate possible for the given signaling constellation and the achieved transmit diversity level.","[Arthur R.

07472359,20081230,Behavioral transformations for hardware synthesis and code optimization based on Taylor Expansion Diagrams,11292493,20060156260,20060713,"A systematic method and system for behavioral transformations for hardware synthesis and code optimization in software compilation based on Taylor Expansion Diagrams. The system can be integrated with any suitable architectural synthesis system. It can also be built into a compiler tool for general purpose processor or into a specific target compiler. For hardware synthesis, an arithmetic expression of the computation is extracted from the behavioral-level HDL design or directly from its matrix representation, and represented in canonical data structure, called Taylor Expansion Diagram. In architectural synthesis, factorization, common sub-expression extraction and decomposition of the resulting Taylor Expansion Diagram is performed, producing an optimized data flow graph, from which the structural HDL design is obtained using standard architectural synthesis. For software compilation and code optimization, common sub-expression extraction and factorization serve as pre-compilation optimization tasks performed according to the target architecture to generate a new code for the compiler.",[Maciej Ciesielski][Serkan Askar][Emmanuel Boutillon][Jeremie Guillot],[University of Massachusetts],"This application claims priority of provisional application Ser.

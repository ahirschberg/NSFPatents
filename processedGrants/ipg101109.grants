07828735,20101109,Methods for providing diagnostic information using endocardial surface data for a patient's heart,11801457,20080077032,20080327,"Methods for providing diagnostic information using endocardial surface data for a patient's heart are described herein. In some embodiments, endocardial surface data for the left ventricle of a heart is received. The endocardial surface data represents the endocardial surface of the left ventricle at multiple times over a heartbeat and is obtained using a volumetric imaging application. A representation in prolate spheroidal coordinates of the endocardial surface of the left ventricle at least a portion of the multiple times is generated using the endocardial surface data. The prolate spheroidal coordinates include a longitudinal angular coordinate μ, a circumferential angular coordinate θ, and a coordinate λ as a function of longitudinal angular coordinate μ and circumferential angular coordinate θ. A measure that provides diagnostic information related to the left ventricle is computed based at least on part on the value of coordinate λ.",[Jeffrey W. Holmes][Kevin D. Costa][Susan L.

07829140,20101109,Method of forming iron oxide core metal shell nanoparticles,11391883,"","","A method of forming mono-disperse iron-oxide core metal shell nanoparticles is disclosed. Particle size of the oxide core seeds is controlled and capped seeds are formed. The capping layer is desorbed by a thermally activated process and metal such as gold is chemically deposited on the core seeds in situ. This process can be repeated to produce multi-metal or different metal shells. A second capping layer is applied on the core/shell composite nanoparticles. In another step, the particles are sized by centrifuging to obtain a tightly controlled and narrow particle size distribution. The water-dispersibility of the particles is achieved by a thiol exchange reaction on the gold shell of the core/shell nanoparticles or by deposition of gold on ferritin-derived iron oxide cores in aqueous solution. Mono and multilayer thin films are assembled on different substrates using the core/shell particles and linking molecules.",[Chuan-Jian Zhong][Lingyan Wang][Jin Luo],[The Research Foundation of the State University of New York],"",20060329,This invention was made with government support under CHE0349040 awarded by National Science Foundation.

In one embodiment, a silicon wafer is cleaned and reacted with stabilized pirhana etch to provide an oxide surface. The surface is reacted with the trichlorosilyl end of alkyltrichlorosilanes to prepare self assembling monomers (SAMs). The alkyltrichlorosilanes have the general formula R1-R—SiCl, where R1 is —OH, —NH, —COOH, —SH, COOCH, —CN, and R is a conjugated hydrocarbon, such as (CH2)where n is in the range of 3 to 18. The functionalized end of the SAM can optionally modified chemically as appropriate, and is then reacted with metal-bearing species such as tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium, Ti[N(CH)], (TDMAT) to provide a titanium nitride layer.",[James R.

07829155,20101109,Nanothin polymer coatings containing thiol and methods of use thereof,11871669,"","","The present invention provides a new monomer and methods of using the monomer to fabricate robust polymer surface coatings with controlled thicknesses between 1 and 5 nanometers. The coatings are composed of a new material containing polymerized monomers of 4-vinylbenzenepropanethiol. The polymer surface coating may be applied to metal and silicon. The method includes exposing a metal substrate to a solution of the monomer in hexanes in order to deposit a monolayer of the monomer onto the metal surface. The substrate is then irradiated with ultraviolet radiation in order to graft a thin polymer coating onto the surface. The procedure can be repeated in order to control the thickness of the coating between about 1 nm and 5 nm. Alternatively, thermally initiated polymerization or deposition of partially oligomerized monomers onto the surface provides nanothin coatings with identical performance. The coating provides complete surface coverage, is extremely robust, and exhibits excellent insulating and anti-corrosive properties.",[Evgueni Pinkhassik][Larry Todd Banner][Benjamin T.

Intervals are defined for the packet flow. Some of the intervals are selected as group A intervals while other intervals are selected as group B intervals. Group A and group B intervals are paired and assigned to watermark bits. A first or second value may be encoded by increasing the relative packet time between packets in either the group A (for the first bit value) or group B (for the second bit value) interval(s) of the interval pair(s) assigned to the watermark bits that are to represent the first or second bit value and the beginning of the same group interval(s).

07323136,20080129,Containerless mixing of metals and polymers with fullerenes and nanofibers to produce reinforced advanced materials,10182081,"","","The present invention relates to fullerene, nanotube, or nanofiber filled metals and polymers. This invention stems from a cross-disciplinary combination of electromagnetic and acoustic processing and property enhancement of materials through fullerene or nanofiber additives. Containerless processing (CP) in the form of electromagnetic field enduced and/or acoustic mixing leads to controlled dispersion of fullerenes, nanotubes, or nanofibers in various matrices. The invention provides methods of mixing that highly disperse and align the fullerenes, nanotubes, or nanofibers within the matrices of metals and polymers. The invention provides new compositions of matter and multifunctional materials based on processing, composition, and degree of in situ processing.",[Enrique V.

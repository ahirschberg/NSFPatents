07658340,20100209,System and method for nanoparticle and nanoagglomerate fluidization,11605176,20070108320,20070517,"With the coupling of an external field and aeration (or a flow of another gas), nanoparticles can be smoothly and vigorously fluidized. A magnetic force and/or pre-treatment may be employed with the fluidizing gas and, when coupled with a fluidizing medium, provide excellent means for achieving homogenous nanofluidization. The magnetic force interacts with non-fluidizing magnetic particles and helps to break channels as well as provide enough energy to disrupt the strong interparticle forces, thereby establishing an advantageous agglomerate size distribution. Enhanced fluidization is reflected by improved performance-related attributes. The fluidized nanoparticles may be coated, surface-treated and/or surface-modified in the fluidized state. In addition, the fluidized nanoparticles may participate in a reaction, either as a reactant or a catalyst, while in the fluidized state.",[Robert Pfeffer][Caroline H. Nam][Rajesh N.

Vector-imagery conflation is an efficient approach that exploits knowledge from multiple data sources to identify a set of accurate control points. Vector-imagery conflation provides automatic and accurate alignment of various vector datasets and imagery, and is appropriate for GIS applications, for example, requiring alignment of vector data and imagery over large geographical regions. Map-imagery conflation utilizes common vector datasets as “glue” to automatically integrate street maps with imagery. This approach provides automatic, accurate, and intelligent images that combine the visual appeal and accuracy of imagery with the detailed attribution information often contained in such diverse maps. Both conflation approaches are applicable for GIS applications requiring, for example, alignment of vector data, raster maps, and imagery. If desired, the conflated data generated by such systems may be retrieved on-demand.",[Ching-Chien Chen][Craig A.

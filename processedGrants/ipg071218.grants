07309644,20071218,System and method of fabrication and application of thin-films with continuously graded or discrete physical property parameters to functionally broadband monolithic microelectronic optoelectronic/sensor/actuator device arrays,10998149,20060115588,20060601,"A system and method are provided to fabricate thin-films having different physical property parameters or having physical property parameters that continuously change across functionally broadband monolithic device arrays. The fabrication method deposits the thin-film including layers on a substrate of a monolithic chip. The method defines a desired gradient profile of each layer forming the thin-film, each gradient profile including a desired thinnest profile and a desired thickest profile. The method further aligns an aperture of a mask over the substrate to form the thin-film and calculates a shutter speed for the specified gradient profile of each layer across the desired area of the substrate, and deposits each layer on the substrate, through the aperture, as the aperture of the shutter moves at the calculated shutter speed from the desired thinnest profile of each layer to the desired thickest profile of each layer.",[Ichiro Takeuchi][Wei Yang][Kao-Shuo Chang][Ratnakar D.

07309842,20071218,Shielded monolithic microplasma source for prevention of continuous thin film formation,10907024,"","","A monolithic microplasma source includes a dielectric substrate having an outer surface that is exposed to a time varying electric field. A gap layer is positioned on an inner surface of the dielectric substrate. A shield including a slit is positioned on the gap layer. A relief structure is formed in at least one of the gap layer and the dielectric substrate. The dimensions of the gap layer, the slit in the shield, and the relief structure are chosen so as to prevent a formation of a continuous film across the relief structure. A chamber containing a gas is positioned adjacent to the shield so that the gas is ionized to form a microplasma when an electric field is induced in the chamber by the incident time varying electric field.",[Frank C.

07309986,20071218,Methods and apparatus for magnetic resonance imaging in inhomogeneous fields,11385338,20060226837,20061012,"Methods for providing practical magnetic resonance imaging systems that utilize non-homogeneous background fields, B, as well as, possibly non-linear, gradient fields G, Gto make non-invasive measurements to determine, among other things, a spin density function. Two types of non-homogeneous background fields are considered: background fields Bin which the function |B| does not have a critical point within the field of view, and background fields Bsuch that the function |B| has a single critical point within the field of view. In the first case, an MR-imaging device may be constructed by using the permanent gradient in the background field, B, as a slice select gradient, so long as particular criteria are met. In the second case, magnets may be constructed so that |B| has an isolated non-zero local minimum. Using selective excitation, one can excite only the spins lying in a small neighborhood of this local minimum.",[Charles L.

07310363,20071218,Integrated wavelength tunable single and two-stage all-optical wavelength converter,10469789,"","",A semiconductor tunable laser () and an interferometer () coupled to the tunable laser () are monolithically fabricated in a semiconductor heterostructure. The laser also comprises a buried ridge stripe waveguide laser. The interferometer () has a semiconductor optical amplifier () coupled in each arm. A cross-gain semiconductor optical amplifier converter is coupled to the interferometer (). The semiconductor optical amplifier () coupled in each arm is biased so that an optical path length difference between the two arms is in antiphase which results in destructive interference. The output of the tunable laser () is coupled to a coupler. A semiconductor optical amplifier () is used as a gain controller for the semiconductor optical amplifiers in the interferometer () to allow wavelength conversion over a larger range of input signal powers. The heterostructure substrate comprises a low bandgap waveguide layer and thinner multi-quantum well active regions disposed above the low bandgap waveguide layer. The heterostructure substrate has nonabsorbing passive elements formed therein by selectively removing the quantum wells regions above the waveguide layer to allow formation of active and passive sections in the waveguide layer without having to perform a butt joint regrowth. The invention is also characterized as a method of fabricating an integrated optical device as disclosed above in the heterostructure substrate.,[Thomas Gordon Beck Mason][Gregory Fish][Daniel J Blumenthal],[The Regents of the University of California],"The present application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

07234343,20070626,Method and apparatus for evanescent filed measuring of particle-solid separation,10889331,20060005615,20060112,"Evanescent wave scattering by a scanning probe in a scanning probe microscope is utilized to determine and monitor separation between a scanning probe and a sample. A laser light is totally internally reflected at the interface between a more optically dense (incident) medium and less optically dense (transmitting) medium, exciting a decaying evanescent field in the less optically dense medium. A scanning probe, such as a colloidal probe, is dipped into the evanescent field, which scatters off the scanning probe. The portion of the scattered field propagates back into the incident medium and is then detected by a detector. A dependency between the intensity of the scattered evanescent field and the separation between the probe and the incident medium was measured and used in determining the separation. This dependency of intensity is used to prepare images or maps of interfaces. A particular application of determining the separation between the probe and the sample in an atomic force microscope is disclosed.",[William Ducker][John Walz][Spencer Clark],"[Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties, Inc.]","This application claims the benefit of an earlier filing date of U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

The compounds generally include a bridge of pi-conjugated bonds connecting electron donating groups or electron accepting groups. The bridge may be substituted with a variety of substituents as well. Solubility, lipophilicity, absorption maxima and other characteristics of the compounds may be tailored by changing the electron donating groups or electron accepting groups, the substituents attached to or the length of the pi-conjugated bridge. Numerous photophysical and photochemical methods are enabled by converting these compounds to electronically excited states upon simultaneous absorption of at least two photons of radiation.

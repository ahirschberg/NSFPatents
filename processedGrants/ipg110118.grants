07872977,20110118,Multi-criteria optimization for relaying in multi-hop wireless ad hoc and sensor networks,12132860,20090016224,20090115,A generalized multi-parameter mapping function aggregates decision criteria into a single virtual criterion to rank the potential relay candidates. Optimal rules for next hop relay as applicable to both transmitter-side selection and receiver-side election based forwarding schemes are also provided. Examples of network performance based on two optimization criteria include one-hop progress (greediness) and packet success rate (link quality). A suitable mapping function trades off the greediness for link quality. Simulation information is provided that indicates that the implementation according to the mapping function outperforms the reported transmitter-side link-aware forwarding schemes.,[Swades De][Komlan Egoh],[New Jersey Institute of Technology],"The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/941,754 entitled &#x201C;Multi-Criteria Optimization for Relaying in Multihop Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks&#x201D; filed on Jun. 4, 2007, and incorporated herein by reference.",20080604,The present application includes research supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 0435250.

07873727,20110118,System and method for evaluating streaming multimedia quality,12048029,20090234940,20090917,"A system and computer program for evaluating in real-time streaming multimedia quality. The system including a multimedia server connected to a multimedia source and a remote client in communication with the multimedia server over a network. The multimedia server is configured to receive multimedia content from the multimedia source and to transmit the multimedia content as a multimedia stream. The multimedia stream includes a plurality of audio frames and a plurality of video frames. The remote client is configured to establish a multimedia session with the multimedia server, receive the multimedia stream via the multimedia session, monitor the media quality of the multimedia stream, and passively compute a subjective quality of the multimedia stream.",[Sourav Pal][Sumantra Kundu][Kalyan Basu][Sajal Das],"[Board of Regents, The University of Texas Systems]","",20080313,This invention was developed with U.S. Government support under Grant No. IIS-0326505 awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

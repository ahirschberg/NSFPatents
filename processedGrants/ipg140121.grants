08631759,20140121,System and method for depositing thin layers on non-planar substrates by stamping,12697357,20100189837,20100729,"An elastomeric stamp is used to deposit material on a non-planar substrate. A vacuum mold is used to deform the elastomeric stamp and pressure is applied to transfer material from the stamp to the substrate. By decreasing the vacuum applied by the vacuum mold, the elasticity of the stamp may be used to apply this pressure. Pressure also may be applied by applying a force to the substrate and/or the stamp. The use of an elastomeric stamp allows for patterned layers to be deposited on a non-planar substrate with reduced chance of damage to the patterned layer.",[Stephen Forrest][Xin Xu][Xiangfei Qi][Marcelo Davanco],[The Trustees Of Princeton University][The Regents Of The University Of Michigan],"This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser.

The nanotechnology-enabled copper-loaded, silica nanoformulation (CuSiNP/NG) design is a “revolutionary re-invention” of Cu for safe application because it provides a formulation with maximum abundance of ionic Cu, provides sustained and optimal Cu ion release for long-term disease protection, better adherence to plant surfaces and structural surfaces due to gel-based nanostructure of CuSiNG, thus avoiding multiple spray applications and reducing the amount of Cu used in comparison to existing Cu compounds without compromising antibacterial activity. Thus, the silica-based nanoformulation releases copper in non-toxic quantities to the environment and the silica matrix provides an environmentally safe host material with a flexible design that is optimized to provide specific antifungal and antibacterial remediation using infrequent applications.",[Swadeshmukul Santra],"[University of Central Florida Research Foundation, Inc.]","This application is a Divisional of copending U.S. patent application entitled &#x201C;Silica-Based Antibacterial and Antifungal Nanoformulation&#x201D;, filed on Dec. 10, 2008 and assigned Ser.

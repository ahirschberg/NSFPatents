The method involves providing a gel precursor solution or a pre-formed gel in a sealed vessel with the gel or gel precursor at least partially filling the internal volume of the vessel and the sealed vessel being positioned between opposed plates of a hot press; heating and applying a restraining force to the sealed vessel via the hot press plates (where the restraining force is sufficient to minimize substantial venting of the vessel); and then controllably releasing the applied restraining force under conditions effective to form the aerogel. A preferred device for practicing the method is in the form of a hot press having upper and lower press plates, and a mold positioned between the upper and lower plates. Doped aerogel monoliths and their use as chemical sensors are also described.",[Ben M. Gauthier][Ann M. Anderson][Smitesh Bakrania][Mary K. Mahony][Ronald B.

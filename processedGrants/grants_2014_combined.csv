One obstacle to materializing this prospect arises from high viscosity of ILs significantly slowing down sol-gel reactions. A method was developed which provides phosphonium-based, pyridinium-based, and imidazolium-based IL-mediated advanced sol-gel organic-inorganic hybrid materials for capillary microextraction. Scanning electron microscopy results demonstrate that ILs can serve as porogenic agents in sol-gel reactions. IL-mediated sol-gel coatings prepared with silanol-terminated polymers provided up to 28 times higher extractions compared to analogous sol-gel coatings prepared without any IL in the sol solution.

Diamantane is a nanosized hydrocarbon molecule with a 14 carbon atom diamond cubic framework that is terminated by hydrogen atoms. Following the cryomilling of the Al powders and diamantane cages, the average grain size characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The as-cryomilled grain sized was found to be of the order of 22 nm, essentially the same as that for Al cryomilled without diamantane. To determine thermal stability, the powders were sealed in glass tubes in an Ar atmosphere to avoid oxidation and contamination and annealed at different temperatures between 423 and 773K for different holding times. Following these treatments, the grain size of cryomilled Al+1% diamantane was consistently less than that for cryomilled Al by about a factor of two. Preliminary investigations indicate that the grain growth exponent n decreased with increasing temperature, reaching a value of approximately 35 at 423 K. Such a high value of n suggests the operation of strong pinning forces on boundaries during annealing treatment. The thermal stability data were found to be consistent with Burke's model based on drag forces exerted by dispersion particles.",[James C. Earthman][Farghalli A. Mohamed][Rahul K.

Thus, reduced dyes can accumulate in cells and/or tissue to amplify the signal. Once inside the cell or tissue, the reduced dye is reoxidized upon reaction with ROS, and the oxidized dye again becomes membrane impermeable, trapping the dye within the cell.

Noise squeezing occurs through the phase-sensitive amplification process and suppresses one of two quadrature components in input noise.

The model is applicable to relational data with various structures. Under this model, a spectral relational clustering algorithm is provided to cluster multiple types of interrelated data objects simultaneously. The algorithm iteratively embeds each type of data objects into low dimensional spaces and benefits from the interactions among the hidden structures of different types of data objects.",[Bo Long][Zhongfei Zhang],[The Research Foundation for the State University of New York],"The present application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

The database may be associated with a plurality of locks. The plurality of transactions may include a first transaction, a second transaction, and a third transaction. A logical serialization sequence for executing the transactions may be identified. The logical serialization sequence may indicate that (1) the first transaction is to be executed before the second transaction based on all locks that are required by the first transaction being available; (2) the second transaction is to be executed after the first transaction has completed execution based on the second transaction requiring a lock that is required by the first transaction; and (3) the third transaction is to be executed before or during execution of the first transaction based on all locks required by the third transaction being different than the locks required by the first transaction.",[Alexander Thomson][Daniel J.

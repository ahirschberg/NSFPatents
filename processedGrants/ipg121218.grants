08333112,20121218,Frequency tuning of disc resonator gyroscopes via resonator mass perturbation based on an identified model,12481247,20090301193,20091210,Techniques for reducing the frequency split between the Coriolis-coupled modes in disc resonator gyroscopes (DRGs) by perturbing the mass distribution on the disc resonator based on an identified model are disclosed. A model-identification method of tuning a resonator comprises perturbing the mass and measuring a frequency response matrix of the resonator. The frequency response matrix includes a plurality of inputs and a plurality of outputs and the resonator has a plurality of coupled resonance modes. A reduced structural mechanics matrix model of the resonator in sensor and actuator coordinates is identified from the measured frequency response matrix and analyzed to determine generalized eigenvectors of the structural mechanics model and their variations due to selected mass perturbations which is then estimated to improve degeneracy of the plurality of coupled resonance modes based on the generalized eigenvectors of the mass and the stiffness.,"",[The Boeing Company],"This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) of the following U.S. Provisional Patent Application, which is incorporated by reference herein:U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

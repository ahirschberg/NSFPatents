A subset of groups from which sample ballots will be chosen is identified. An identifier is printed on each ballot in the subset. Each ballot has a different identifier than every other ballot in its group. A check is performed to determine whether the identifiers were printed correctly on the ballots. If so, a machine re-count of ballots in each group in the subset is performed and the results are compared to the initial tally of ballots associated with the group. If there is a mismatch, a further investigation is triggered. If there is a match, manual verification is performed on sample ballots from each group. The audit may begin prior to completion of voting from all precincts by estimating the number of samples that will be necessary.",[Edward W. Felten][Joseph A. Calendrino][J.

Transparent conductive composites (TCCs) combine with gold nanoparticles in a conducting polymer matrix to create a conductive, flexible, and electrochromic material. Hybrid, nanostructured surfaces constructed from TCCs are decorated with conjugated conductive oligomer wires. Selective binding of the target to the oligomer alters the electron charge mobility in the TCC, affecting the redox state. The binding event is identified by measuring the conductivity of the TCC and/or through color changes of the TCC. Conjugated oligomers that are functionalized with thiol groups at one end and nitro-derivative receptors at the other provide the bases for selectivity and sensing. The thiol group anchors the oligomer to the metal sites on the TCC surface and the receptor starts the charge transfer mechanism when targeted with the appropriate molecule.",[Norma A Alcantar][Julie Harmon],[University of South Florida],"This application is a Non-Provisional Application of co-pending U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/154,809 filed Feb. 24, 2009; which is incorporated herein by reference.",20100224,This invention was made with government support under CBET0808053 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

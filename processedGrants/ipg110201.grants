Methods in accordance with the present invention comprise growing a Group-III nitride thin-film material while applying an ion flux and preferably while the substrate is stationary or non-rotating substrate. The ion flux is preferably applied as an ion beam at a glancing angle of incidence. Growth under these conditions creates a nanoscale surface corrugation having a characteristic features size, such as can be measured as a wavelength or surface roughness. After the surface corrugation is created, and preferably in the same growth reactor, the substrate is rotated in an ion flux which cause the surface corrugation to be reduced. The result of forming a surface corrugation and then subsequently reducing or removing the surface corrugation is the formation of a nanosculpted region and polished transition region that effectively filter dislocations.

In this process the aryl halide is reacted with an alkyllithium species or is reacted with a metal to replace the aryl-bromine bond with an aryl-lithium or aryl-metal bond, respectively. It has further been discovered that other functionalized carbon nanotubes, after deprotonation with a deprotonation agent, can similarly be utilized in anionic polymerization processes to form polymer-carbon nanotube materials. Additionally or alternatively, a ring opening polymerization process can be performed. The resultant materials can be used by themselves due to their enhanced strength and reinforcement ability when compared to their unbound polymer analogs. Additionally, these materials can also be blended with pre-formed polymers to establish compatibility and enhanced dispersion of nanotubes in otherwise hard to disperse matrices resulting in significantly improved material properties. The resultant polymer-carbon nanotube materials can also be used in drug delivery processes due to their improved dispersion ability and biodegradability, and can also be used for scaffolding to promote cellular growth of tissue.",[James M.

07449738,20081111,Strain-engineered ferroelectric thin films,10977335,20060091434,20060504,"A strained thin film structure includes a substrate layer formed of a crystalline scandate material having a top surface, and a strained layer of crystalline ferroelectric epitaxially grown with respect to the crystalline substrate layer so as to be in a strained state and at a thickness below which dislocations begin to occur in the crystalline ferroelectric layer. An intermediate layer may be grown between the top surface of the substrate layer and the ferroelectric layer wherein the intermediate layer carries the lattice structure of the underlying substrate layer. The properties of the ferroelectric film are greatly enhanced as compared to the bulk ferroelectric material, and such films are suitable for use in applications including ferroelectric memories.",[Chang-Beom Eom][Kyung-Jin Choi][Darrell G.

The architecture (i) detects user-supplied inputs to the page content on the computer's internet browser, (ii) generates a verification request at the mobile device when user-supplied inputs are so-detected, and (iii) transmits the user-supplied inputs from the mobile device as an internet communication only when the verification request is confirmed by the user at the mobile device. The architecture also processes each new page loaded at the mobile device to perform removal and/or obfuscation of selected information associated with the new page in order to generate a modified page. The computer's internet browser is updated to the modified page.",[Chuan Yue][Haining Wang],[College of William and Mary],"",20100928,This invention was made with government support under Grant No. CNS0916022 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

The apparatus may further comprise a feedback controller communicatively coupled to the optical detector and a semiconductive circuit element abutting the cantilever. In response to detecting movement of the optical beam reflected from the cantilever, the feedback controller may apply a voltage to the semiconductive circuit element, which may reduce deflection of the cantilever. The voltage applied by the feedback controller may indicate a strength of the interfacial force between the sample substance and the optical fiber probe.",[Byung Kim],[Boise State University],"",20100409,The U.S. Government may have rights in this invention pursuant to the terms of Grant No. 0852886 awarded by the National Science Foundation.,"","","",""

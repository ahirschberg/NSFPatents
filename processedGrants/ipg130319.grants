The measurements may be performed on three facial areas of sympathetic importance, that is, periorbital, supraorbital, and maxillary. Because the imaging measurements are thermal in nature and comprise multiple components of variable frequency (i.e., blood flow, sweat gland activation, and breathing), wavelets are used as the image analysis framework. The image analysis may be grounded on GSR signals.",[Ioannis Pavlidis],[University of Houston System],"This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/975,073 filed Sep. 25, 2007, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.",20080925,Research leading to the present invention was supported in part by the federal government under a grant from the National Science Foundation (Grant No. ISS-0741581).

Techniques for automated segmentation convert imaging intensity to a signed distance function (SDF), and a voxel structure imposes a uniform sampling grid. Essential properties of the SDF are used to construct upper and lower bounds on the allowed variation in signed distance in 1, 2, and 3 (or more) dimensions. The bounds are combined to produce interval-valued extensions of the SDF, including a tight global extension and more computationally efficient local bounds that provide useful criteria for root exclusion/isolation, enabling modeling of the objects and other applications.",[Duane Storti][Mark Ganter],[University of Washington],"This application is a continuation-in-part of a patent application, &#x201C;Three Dimensional Modeling of Objects,&#x201D; Ser.

A plurality of polynucleotides each encoding a polypeptide sequence is constructed. A frequency that a sequence element is used in a first polynucleotide is different than in a second polynucleotide. Each polynucleotide is expressed in an expression system to obtain an expression property value thereby constructing a dataset that contains, for each respective polynucleotide, sequence element occurrence in the respective polynucleotide and the measured expression property value of the respective polynucleotide. A model is computed that describes variation in the measured expression property values as a function of a plurality of variables and weights. From the model, a property that affects expression of polynucleotides in the expression system is determined, where the property is an effect that the frequency of occurrence of one or more sequence elements has on the expression property of polynucleotides in the expression system.",[Mark Welch][Claes Gustafsson],"[DNA Twopointo, Inc.]","This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/131,238, filed Jun. 6, 2008.

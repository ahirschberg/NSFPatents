07554021,20090630,Composition and method for self-assembly and mineralization of peptide amphiphiles,10534097,20060149036,20060706,"The present invention is directed to a composition useful for making homogeneously mineralized self assembled peptide-amphiphile nanofibers and nanofiber gels. The composition is generally a solution comprised of a positively or negatively charged peptide-amphiphile and a like signed ion from the mineral. Mixing this solution with a second solution containing a dissolved counter-ion of the mineral and/or a second oppositely charged peptide amphiphile, results in the rapid self assembly of the peptide-amphiphiles into a nanofiber gel and templated mineralization of the ions. Templated mineralization of the initially dissolved mineral cations and anions in the mixture occurs with preferential orientation of the mineral crystals along the fiber surfaces within the nanofiber gel. One advantage of the present invention is that it results in homogenous growth of the mineral throughout the nanofiber gel. Another advantage of the present invention is that the nanofiber gel formation and mineralization reactions occur in a single mixing step and under substantially neutral or physiological pH conditions. These homogeneous nanostructured composite materials are useful for medical applications especially the regeneration of damaged bone in mammals. This invention is directed to the synthesis of peptide-amphiphiles with more than one amphiphilic moment and to supramolecular compositions comprised of such multi-dimensional peptide-amphiphiles.

Cancellation of parasitic capacitance is provided for differential mode and common mode split windings where the split windings may be either inductively coupled or not. Forming the split windings as a bifilar winding to increase coupling coefficient further improves performance and allows cancellation (as distinct from parasitic capacitance reduction) and avoidance of resonance in circuits in which an inductor is not permitted in the ground return path.,[Shuo Wang][Fred C.

Due to the optical fiber based construction of the switching device it is suitable for optical fiber networks The on-off function of the switch is useful for isolation and connection of node(s) from a fiber optical network without having to turn off a laser.

Each path has at least one magneto-optic Faraday rotator (MOFR) controlled by a field. When the field is present, the polarization of the optical beam changes, thereby turning the switch on or off depending on the initial polarization of the beam. A beam coupler couples the orthogonal polarized paths at the output of the all-fiber magneto-optic switch. The MOFR is a bismuth substituted iron garnet.

This method demonstrates the ability to acquire information on molecular dynamics, couplings and structure in a simple apparatus. Multi-dimensional methods can be used for diagnostic and analytical measurements in the biological, biomedical, and chemical fields.",[Lauren DeFlores][Andrei Tokmakoff],[Massachusetts Institute of Technology],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/967,889, filed Sep. 7, 2007, which is incorporated by reference herein.",20080908,This invention was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (CHE-0616575) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DE-FG02-99ER14988).

The semi-supervised learning problem is approached by developing semiparametric regularization, which attempts to discover the marginal distribution of the data to learn the parametric function through exploiting the geometric distribution of the data. This learned parametric function can then be incorporated into the supervised learning on the available labeled data as the prior knowledge. A semi-supervised learning approach is provided which incorporates the unlabeled data into the supervised learning by a parametric function learned from the whole data including the labeled and unlabeled data. The parametric function reflects the geometric structure of the marginal distribution of the data. Furthermore, the proposed approach which naturally extends to the out-of-sample data is an inductive learning method in nature.",[Zhen Guo][Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang],[The Research Foundation of State University of New York],"",20090810,"This invention was made with government support under contract IIS0535162 awarded by NSF, contract FA8750-05-2-0284 awarded by AFRL and contract FA9550-06-1-0327 awarded by USAF/AFOSR.

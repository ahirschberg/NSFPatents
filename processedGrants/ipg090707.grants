07555941,20090707,Scanner for probe microscopy,11899309,20080078240,20080403,"A scanner for probe microscopy that avoids low resonance frequencies and accounts better for piezo nonlinearities. The x, y and z axes of a linear stack scanner are partially decoupled from each other while maintaining all mechanical joints stiff in the direction of actuation. The scanning probe microscope comprises a probe, a housing, at least two actuators, each coupled to the housing, and a support coupled to the housing and to at least a first of the actuators at a position spaced from the point at which the actuator is coupled to the housing. The support constrains the motion of the first actuator along a first axis while permitting translation along a second axis. The actuators are preferably orthogonally arranged linear stacks of flat piezos, preferably in push-pull configuration. The support can take different forms in different embodiments of the invention. In a particular embodiment, the scanner is a 2D scanner having a support frame with x and y axes, and a member for supporting an object to be moved such as a sample for a probe, the scanner comprising a flexure and flexure coupled cross-conformed piezos arranged along x and y axes. Expansion of the piezos is measured by at least two strain gauges disposed to measure the differential motion of at least two opposed actuators. The strain gauges are preferably arranged to compensate for ambient temperature changes, and preferably two or more strain gauges of identical type are disposed on each actuator to magnify the strain signal.",[Paul K.

Large area fabrication of nano-structured interconnects is demonstrated at a very fine pitch. This technology can be used for pushing the limits of current flip chip bonding in terms of pitch, number of I/Os, superior combination of electrical and mechanical properties as well as reworkability. Sol-gel and electroless processes were developed to demonstrate film bonding interfaces between metallic pads and nano interconnects.

These structures can be used as IC-package interconnects that can lead to reliable, low-cost and high-performance nano wafer-level packaging. High-aspect-ratio low CTE polyimide structures with low stress, high toughness and strength were fabricated using plasma etching. The dry etching process was tuned to yield a wall angle above 80 degrees leading to an aspect ratio higher than 4. The etching process also leads to roughened sidewalls for selective electroless plating on the sidewalls of the polymer structures. These fabricated structures show reduction in the stresses at the interfaces and superior reliability as IC-package nano interconnects. Metal-coated polymer structures from MEMS fabrication techniques can provide low-cost high-performance solutions for wafer-level-packaging.

The vacant p-orbital of the boron atoms conjugate with the pi-conjugated orbital system of the aromatic or unsaturated monomer units extending the pi-conjugation length of the polymer across the boron atoms. The pi-conjugated organoboron polymers are electron-deficient and, therefore, exhibit n-type semiconducting properties, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence. The invention provides thin-film organic polymer electronic devices, such as organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), organic diodes, organic photodiodes, organic thin-film transistors (TFTs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), printable or flexible electronics, such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, electronic papers, and printed circuit elements, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), and energy storage devices employing the pi-conjugated organoboron polymers.

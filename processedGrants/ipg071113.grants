The devices and filters include a vibrating polysilicon micromechanical “hollow-disk” ring resonators obtained by removing quadrants of material from solid disk resonators, but purposely leaving intact beams or spokes of material with quarter-wavelength dimensions to non-intrusively support the resonators. The use of notched support attachments closer to actual extensional ring nodal points further raises the Q. Vibrating micromechanical hollow-disk ring filters including mechanically coupled resonators with resonator Q's greater than 10,000 achieve filter Q's on the order of thousands via a low-velocity coupling scheme. A longitudinally mechanical spring is utilized to attach the notched-type, low-velocity coupling locations of the resonators in order to achieve a extremely narrow passband.",[Clark T.-C.

The systems and methods include pixel by pixel motion estimation and compensation and efficient quantization of residual errors. The present invention applies block estimation of the residual error produced by motion compensation. The block estimation is applied by a local decoder to generate synthesized blocks of video data. The block estimation approximated uses a set of predetermined motion estimation errors that are stored as error vectors in a codebook. The codebook is included in an encoder of the present invention and converts an error vector for each block to an error vector index. The error vector index, which introduces minimal transmission burden, is then sent from the encoder to a target decoder. A receiving decoder also includes a copy of the codebook and converts the error vector index to its associated error vector for reconstruction of video data.",[Jiandong Shen][Wai-Yip Chan],"[Cisco Technology, Inc.]","This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) from co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/231,085 filed Sep. 8, 2000, naming Jiandong Shen et al. as inventors, and titled &#x201C;Code Excited Pel-Recursive Motion Compensation Video Encoding&#x201D;, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.",20010831,This application was made in part with government support under Grant number MIP-9502629 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

07296163,20071113,System and methods for encrypted execution of computer programs,09759402,20020041680,20020411,"The invention provides a method for encrypting a program for execution on a remote host computer on a network, such that correct execution by the remote host computer is ensured, and such that the remote host computer remains unaware of the computations or data associated with execution. Results from the computations at the remote host computer are transmitted to a control computer, on the network, which decodes the results to useful data representative as output from the program. In a first step of the method, the program is encoded as a unitary matrix multiplication, U, of i dimensions by j dimensions. Uis the set of unitary matrices of size n, forms a non-commutative group under matrix multiplication, and has a unique group-invariant Haar measure probability distribution; Uis thus an element of U. In a second step, an input data string to the program is encoded as a vector bof n dimensions. The first and second steps can be performed in either order. In a third step, two independent identically distributed unitary matrices X, Yare generated from the Haar distribution over U. Preferably, X, Yare randomly generated. In a fourth step, U′ is computed as XUY* and sent to the remote host over the network. In a fifth step, b′ is computed as Yb and sent to the remote host over the network. The fourth and fifth steps can be performed in either order. In a sixth step, the remote host computes the product of XUY* and Yb and sends the result to the control computer on the network. In a seventh step, the control computer computes X*XUb to determine the multiplication of Ub, the desired output of the program.",[George Cybenko],[The Trustees of Dartmouth College],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/181,363, filed Feb. 8, 2000, entitled System and Methods for Executed Program Encryption, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.",20010112,"The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent holder to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of Contract No. F30602-98-2 -0107, awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Contract No. F49620-97-1-0382, awarded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Contract No. ATM-9873138 awarded by the National Science Foundation, and Contract No. CCR-98113744 awarded by the National Science Foundation.","","","",""

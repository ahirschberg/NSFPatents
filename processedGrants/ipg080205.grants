The nanocrystal can be a dependable and accurate indicator of temperature. The intensity of emission of the nanocrystal varies with temperature and can be highly sensitive to surface temperature. The nanocrystals can be processed with a binder to form a matrix, which can be varied by altering the chemical nature of the surface of the nanocrystal. A nanocrystal with a compatibilizing outer layer can be incorporated into a coating formulation and retain its temperature sensitive emissive properties.",[Moungi G. Bawendi][Vikram C.

A tip can be used to pattern a structure which can initiate polymerization. The structure can be then exposed to monomer to induce polymerization at the structure. Alternatively, a tip can be used to pattern a surface with a monomer in which the surface is treated with polymerization catalyst so that polymerization occurs at the patterning site. Ring-opening metathesis polymerization can be carried out with use of the tip to control the polymerization. The tip can be a sharp tip as used in for example an atomic force microscope tip. Norbornene types of monomers can be used. Biological macromolecules can be also prepared.",[Chad A.

The composite proton exchange membrane comprises a proton exchange membrane which has been modified by replacing membrane protons in desired areas of the membrane with a cationic polymer. The cationic polymer is preferably formed by introducing a quaternary salt monomer into the membrane and then effecting the polymerization of the monomer. The modified areas of the proton exchange membrane exhibit increased strength, reduced water and gas permeability, reduced proton conductivity and reduced acidity. Accordingly, by modifying the periphery of the membrane, one can obtain an integral sealing edge for the membrane, and by modifying certain interior regions of the membrane, one can divide the membrane into a plurality of sealed segments.",[Robert C.

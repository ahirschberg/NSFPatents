Capacitor plates in a MEMS device of the invention are carried on cantilevered opposing micro-scale plates separated by a micro-scale gap under an unstrained condition. At least one of the micro-scale plates may be attached to a substrate or forms a substrate, which may be part of a monitored system. When a load is applied to the substrate, distal ends of the opposing cantilevered micro-scale plates become further separated, resulting in a change of capacitance. The change of capacitance is proportional to a load and therefore is an indication of the strain. Electrodes may be integrated into the strain sensor to provide a connection to measurement circuitry, for example. Sensors of the invention also provide for telemetric communication using radio frequency (RF) energy and can be interrogated without a power supply to the sensor.",[Kevin Walsh][Mark Crain][William Hnat][Douglas Jackson][Ji-Tzuoh Lin][John Naber],"","",20040924,This invention was made with government assistance provided by the National Science Foundation under Contract No. BES-0097521.

When modified with suitable chemical groups using diazonium chemistry, the nanotubes can be made chemically compatible with a polymer matrix, allowing transfer of the properties of the nanotubes (such as mechanical strength) to the properties of the composite material as a whole. To achieve this, the derivatized (modified) carbon nanotubes are physically blended with the polymeric material, and/or, if desired, allowed to react at ambient or elevated temperature. These methods can be utilized to append functionalities to the nanotubes that will further covalently bond to the host polymer matrix, or directly between two tubes themselves. Furthermore, the nanotubes can be used as a generator of polymer growth, wherein the nanotubes are derivatized with a functional group that is an active part of a polymerization process, which would also result in a composite material in which the carbon nanotubes are chemically involved.",[James M.

07304607,20071204,Microwave self-phasing antenna arrays for secure data transmission and satellite network crosslinks,11296240,20060238414,20061026,"A high-directivity transponder system uses a dual system of a retrodirective array transmitting a data signal peak toward an interrogator source, and a self-null-steering array transmitting a null toward the interrogator source and a jamming signal elsewhere, resulting in high S/N reception at the interrogator source and avoidance of interception. Integrating modulators would allow each array to transmit different data while the spectra of the transmitted signals are identical, thus disabling interception. The system enables secure point-to-point communications and can be used for short-distance wireless data transmission systems such as wireless LAN and RFID servers. One mobile may send a broadcast interrogator signal, causing the other mobile devices to send a reply signal back to the interrogating mobile device only in the direction of the interrogating mobile device, such that each of the other mobile devices identifies its position to only the interrogating mobile device in response to its broadcast interrogator signal. As another aspect, self-steering signal transmission is employed for randomly oriented satellites using circularly polarized, two-dimensional retrodirective arrays. Quadruple subharmonic mixing is used as an effective means of achieving phase conjugation when a high-frequency LO is not feasible or inapplicable. These features may be used for small-satellite communications, secure tactical communications, search and rescue, enemy location fixing and tracking, UAV command and control, forest fire detection, marine-based tracking, and many other applications requiring secure communications with high signal directivity.",[Ryan Y.

RE041693,20100914,Magnetic switching of charge separation lifetimes in artificial photosynthetic reaction centers,11565506,"","","Excitation of a triad artificial photosynthetic reaction center consisting of a porphyrin (P) convalently linked to a fullerene electron acceptor (C) and a carotenoid secondary donor (C) leads to the formation of a long-lived C-P-Ccharge-separated state via photoinduced electron transfer. This reaction occurs in a frozen organic glass down to at least 8 K. At 77 K, charge recombination of C*-P-Coccurs on the μs time scale, and yields solely the carotenoid triplet state. In the presence of a small (20 mT) static magnetic field, the lifetime of the charge-separated state is increased by 50%. This is ascribed to the effect of the magnetic field on interconversion of the singlet and triplet biradicals. At zero field, the initially formed singlet biradical state is in equilibrium with the three triplet biradical sublevels, and all four states have comparable populations. Decay to the carotenoid triplet only occurs from the three triplet sublevels. In the presence of the field, the S and Tstates are still rapidly interconverting, but the Tand Tstates are isolated from the other two due to the electronic Zeeman interaction, and are not significantly populated. Under these conditions, recombination to the triplet occurs only from T, and the lifetime of the charge-separated state increases. This effect can be used as the basis for a magnetically controlled optical or optoelectronic switch (e.g. AND gate).","[John D. Gust, Jr.][Ana L.

This binding process changes the conformation of the mRNA, which causes a change in gene expression by a variety of different mechanisms. Modified versions of these natural “riboswitches” (created by using various nucleic acid engineering strategies) can be employed as designer genetic switches that are controlled by specific effector compounds. Such effector compounds that activate a riboswitch are referred to herein as trigger molecules. The natural switches are targets for antibiotics and other small molecule therapies. In addition, the architecture of riboswitches allows actual pieces of the natural switches to be used to construct new non-immunogenic genetic control elements, for example the aptamer (molecular recognition) domain can be swapped with other non-natural aptamers (or otherwise modified) such that the new recognition domain causes genetic modulation with user-defined effector compounds.

Most specifically, this invention discloses and claims processes for amplifying nucleic acid analogs containing non-standard nucleobases using polymerase chain reactions, and combinations of non-standard nucleobases, analogs of standard nucleotides, and enzymes that perform this amplification. Most specifically, this invention is for the use of 2-thiothymidine triphosphate (2-thioTTP) instead of thymidine triphosphate in a six letter polymerase chain reaction that includes 2′-deoxyadenosine triphosphate, 2′-deoxyguanosine triphosphate, 2′-deoxycytidine triphosphate, 2′-deoxy-iso-guanosine triphosphate, and 2′-deoxy-iso-cytidine triphosphate, as well as their forms that contain side chain modifications. Because of the size and hydrogen bonding properties of the sulfur unit in 2-thioT, 2-thioT does not mispair effectively with the minor tautomer of isoG. This permits the PCR amplification of a six letter artificially expanded genetic information system, we examined the relative rates of misincorporation of 2-thioTTP and TTP opposite isoG using affinity electrophoresis with a fidelity-per-round of ca. 98%. The analogous PCR employing TTP has a fidelity-per-round of only ca. 93%.

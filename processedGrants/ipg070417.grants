07205585,20070417,Organic photosensitive optoelectronic device with an exciton blocking layer,11350008,20070045661,20070301,An organic photosensitive optoelectronic device having a plurality of cells disposed between a first electrode and a second electrode. Each cell includes a photoconductive organic hole transport layer adjacent to a photoconductive organic electron transport layer. A metal or metal substitute is disposed between each of the cells. At least one exciton blocking layer is disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode.,[Stephen R.

07206470,20070417,Planar lightwave circuit waveguide bends and beamsplitters,10973068,20050152633,20050714,"A planar lightwave circuit has a waveguide having a bend and plurality of multiple trenches with parallel front and back interfaces. The trench and waveguide refractive indexes are different such that a refractive interface is defined between the waveguide and the trench. The trench may include a material of higher refractive index than the waveguide, such as silicon, or alternatively a material having a lower refractive index than the waveguide, such as an air void. The trench is disposed on the waveguide bend such that the front and back planar interfaces have an angle of incidence to a direction of the lightwave propagation from the waveguide. The invention also includes beamsplitters that include trenches that reflect a portion of a lightwave in a first direction and a portion of a lightwave in a second direction.",[Lixia Li][Gregory P. Nordin][Jianhua Jiang][Jennifer M. English],[University of Alabama in Huntsville],"This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

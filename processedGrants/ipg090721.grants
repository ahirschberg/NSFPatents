07563457,20090721,Nanoparticle assembled hollow spheres,10263271,20030082237,20030501,"A design strategy for constructing hierarchically structured materials using nanoparticles and synthetic biopolymers has been developed. Block copolypeptides or homopolymer polyelectrolytes are used as structure-directing agents to arrange nanoparticles (composed of metals, metal non-oxides, metal oxides, or organics) into unusual microstructures, such as spheres, “apples” and “cups.” Hollow spheres can be made wherein nanoparticles of one composition are spatially oriented completely interior or exterior to nanoparticles of a second composition. These aggregates contain nanoparticles only in the shell walls, and maintain their hollowness upon calcination. These shapes can also be fabricated into films. These robust materials are anticipated to have great promise in applications that require surface catalysis, magnetic/electronic/optic properties, transport capabilities, and combinations thereof, such as drug delivery, packaging, catalysis, and sensors.",[Jennifer Cha][Timothy J.

07564120,20090721,Electrical passivation of silicon-containing surfaces using organic layers,11219172,20060006433,20060112,"Electrical structures and devices may be formed and include an organic passivating layer that is chemically bonded to a silicon-containing semiconductor material to improve the electrical properties of electrical devices. In different embodiments, the organic passivating layer may remain within finished devices to reduce dangling bonds, improve carrier lifetimes, decrease surface recombination velocities, increase electronic efficiencies, or the like. In other embodiments, the organic passivating layer may be used as a protective sacrificial layer and reduce contact resistance or reduce resistance of doped regions. The organic passivation layer may be formed without the need for high-temperature processing.",[Nathan S. Lewis][William J.

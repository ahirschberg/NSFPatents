07547449,20090616,Method for treating a bone defect with an organic/inorganic composite,11433725,20060204581,20060914,"The subject invention concerns a composite comprising an organic fluid-swellable, fibrous matrix, such as collagen, and a mineral phase, such as calcium carbonate or phosphate mineral phase, for use as a biomimetic of bone. In another aspect, the subject invention concerns a process for making a composite involving the inclusion of acidic polymers to a supersaturated mineralizing solution, in order to induce an amorphous liquid-phase precursor to the inorganic mineral, which is then absorbed (pulled by capillary action) into the organic matrix. Advantageously, once solidified, a high mineral content can be achieved, with the inorganic mineral crystals embedded within the collagen fibers (intrafibrillarly) and oriented such that they are aligned along the long axes of the fibers of the organic matrix, thereby closely mimicking the natural structure of bone. The present invention further concerns a method of treating a patient suffering from a bone defect by applying a biomimetic composite to the bone defect site.",[Laurie B. Gower][Matthew J.

07548137,20090616,Generalized cancellation of inductor winding capacitance,11850762,20080094160,20080424,"An inductor device or filter such as an electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter which includes an inductor provides cancellation of parasitic capacitance of the inductor and extends high frequency performance of the inductor or filter by using an inductor network (a special case being split windings) and including capacitors to couple signals corresponding to those which are passed by the equivalent parallel capacitance of an inductor of a network of inductors such as in a multi-phase power supply of voltage converter to another inductor terminal, ground or an inductor in the ground return path. Cancellation of parasitic capacitance is provided for differential mode and common mode windings where the windings may be either inductively coupled or not. Forming the windings as a bifilar winding to increase coupling coefficient further improves performance and allows cancellation (as distinct from parasitic capacitance reduction) and avoidance of resonance in circuits in which an inductor is not permitted in the ground return path. Different inductance values and turns ratios of any or all inductors of the network, including multi-phase networks, may be accommodated.",[Shuo Wang][Fred C.

In some embodiments, the polymer molecules are poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and the bridging molecules are amino acids. Some embodiments of the invention provide devices comprising hydrogels, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising biologically active molecules within hydrogels. Another aspect provides methods for forming hydrogels of the invention.",[Buddy D. Ratner][Prabha D.

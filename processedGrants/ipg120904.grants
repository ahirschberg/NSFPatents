The sensor array is formed from a supporting member, in which a plurality of cavities may be formed. A series of chemically sensitive particles, in one embodiment, are positioned within the cavities. The particles may produce a signal when a receptor, coupled to the particle, interacts with the cardiovascular risk factor analyte and the particle-analyte complex is visualized using a visualization reagent. Using pattern recognition techniques, the analytes within a multi-analyte fluid may be characterized. In an embodiment, each cavity of the plurality of cavities is designed to capture and contain a specific size particle. Flexible projections may be positioned over each of the cavities to provide retention of the particles in the cavities.","","[Board of Regents, The University of Texas System]","This application claims priority to Provisional Patent Application No. 60/375,775 entitled &#x201C;METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR THE DETECTION OF CARDIAC RISK FACTORS&#x201D; filed on Apr. 26, 2002.",20030428,This invention was made with government support under GM057306 awarded by the National Institutes of Health; and under 9631394 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

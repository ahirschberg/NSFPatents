07820840,20101026,Epoxidation catalyst and process,12498942,20100010243,20100114,"Disclosed herein is a catalytic method of converting alkenes to epoxides. This method generally includes reacting alkenes with oxygen in the presence of a specific silver catalyst under conditions suitable to produce a yield of the epoxides. The specific silver catalyst is a silver nanocrystal having a plurality of surface planes, a substantial portion of which is defined by Miller indices of (100). The reaction is performed by charging a suitable reactor with this silver catalyst and then feeding the reactants to the reactor under conditions to carry out the reaction. The reaction may be performed in batch, or as a continuous process that employs a recycle of any unreacted alkenes. The specific silver catalyst has unexpectedly high selectivity for epoxide products. Consequently, this general method (and its various embodiments) will result in extraordinarily high epoxide yields heretofore unattainable.",[Suljo Linic][Phillip Christopher],[The Regents of the University of Michigan],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

The method also provides methods yielding α-substituted β-amino aldehydes and β-substituted γ-amino alcohols. The present method according to this invention allows for increased yield and easier purification using minimal chromatography or crystallization. The methods described herein are based on an aldehyde aminomethylation which involves a Mannich reaction between an aldehyde and a formaldehyde-derived N,O-acetal (iminium precursor) and a catalyst, such as, for example, L-proline or a pyrrolidine. The invention allows for large scale, commercial preparation of β-amino acids.",[Yonggui Chi][Samuel H. Gellman][William C. Pomerantz][William S. Horne][Li Guo][Emily P.

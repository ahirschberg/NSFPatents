Multiple electrodes (e.g., two or three) are disposed on or otherwise constitute an elongated object forming a tip. Exemplary electrode configurations include, but are not limited to, coaxial and triaxial arrangements. A voltage is applied across these electrodes to produce a non-uniform electromagnetic field proximate to the tip thereby creating a dielectrophoretic trap. Once trapped, a particle may be moved to desired locations via manipulation of the elongated object or the medium in which the particle is located. Multiple DEP tweezers apparatus may be arranged to form arrays of tips capable of respectively generating local electromagnetic fields confined to the tips. Such DEP arrays may be employed in nanofabrication processes involving nanolithography or nano-manipulation, as well as data storage and retrieval applications.",[Thomas Hunt][Robert Westervelt][Ania Bleszynski][Jonathan Aguilar][Keith Brown],[President and Fellows of Harvard College],"The present application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e), to U.S. provisional application Ser.

When, during a timeslot, the frequency hopping sequence would select a beacon frequency that if transmitted would violate spectrum policy that is in place during that timeslot, then, during that timeslot, a beacon is not transmitted during that timeslot. During each timeslot, a neighbor receiving node attempts to detect and decode a transmitted beacon at a frequency specified by the frequency hopping sequence that it expects a transmitting node to be using. When a receiving node successfully detects and decodes a beacon transmitted by a transmitting node, neighbor discovery between the transmitting and receiving nodes is achieved.",[Krishna Balachandran][Joseph H Kang],[Alcatel Lucent],"",20060922,This invention was made with Government support under Contract CNS 0434854 1/3 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

08023570,20110920,System and apparatus for error control codes based on layering and linear transformations,12027005,20090110106,20090430,"A powerful new class of methods for encoding digital data for reliable transmission over unreliable communication channels is described. With this method, the message bits are divided into multiple submessages and the bits in each layer are encoded using a standard error correction code to provide a plurality of subcodewords. A first linear transformation is applied to each of the subcodewords. The so-transformed subcodewords from the different submessages are then combined to form a first redundancy block to be transmitted. Additional redundancy blocks are generated by repeating this process on the same message but with jointly related nonidentical sets of linear transformations. The result is a set of codewords for each message which are then used to generate a transmitted waveform in one of several different ways, depending upon the application. For example, the codewords can be used in sequence (temporally) to form a rateless code for transmission over channels of unknown quality, in which case a receiver accumulates as many of the codewords as are necessary to successfully decode. As another example, the codewords can be spatially distributed if the channel has multiple-inputs, as would be the case in a multi-antenna system. As still another example, the codewords can be distributed over subchannels in a frequency-division multiplexing system.",[Gregory W.

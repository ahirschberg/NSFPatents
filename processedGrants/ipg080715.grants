07399579,20080715,Fabrication of metallic microstructures via exposure of photosensitive composition,10763819,20040182713,20040923,A method of forming microstructures. An article including a metal atom precursor is disproportionally exposed to electromagnetic radiation in an amount and intensity sufficient to convert some of the precursor to elemental metal. Additional conductive material may then be deposited onto the elemental metal to produce a microstructure.,[Tao Deng][Francisco Arias][Rustem F. Ismagilov][Paul J. A. Kenis][George M.

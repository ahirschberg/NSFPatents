07647848,20100119,Integrated system for simultaneous inspection and manipulation,11564678,20070227273,20071004,"A base unit for integrating an imaging device, such as an atomic force microscope, and a manipulation device, such as a nano-manipulator. The integration of the two devices permits one device to perform both imaging and manipulation simultaneously. The simultaneous execution of these two tasks increases the rate at which experiments can be conducted, thereby improving the throughput of the device. Also, the simultaneous execution of these two tasks allows imaging during manipulation, which may be desirable or beneficial in some circumstances.",[Bradley E.

07649166,20100119,Near-field nano-imager,12233273,20090095882,20090416,"An imaging device. In one embodiment, the imaging device includes a plurality of first electrode strips in parallel to each other along a first direction x, wherein each first electrode strip has an elongated body with a first surface and an opposite, second surface and a thickness n. The imaging device also includes a plurality of second electrode strips in parallel to each other along a second direction y that is substantially perpendicular to the first direction x, wherein each second electrode strip has an elongated body with a first surface and an opposite, second surface and a thickness n. The plurality of second electrode strips are positioned apart from the plurality of first electrode strips along a third direction z that is substantially perpendicular to the first direction x and the second direction y such that the plurality of first electrode strips and the plurality of second electrode strips are crossing each other accordingly to form a corresponding number of crossing points. And at each crossing point, a semiconductor component is filled between the second surface of a corresponding first electrode strip and the first surface of a corresponding second electrode strip to form an addressable pixel.",[Boyang Liu][Seng-Tiong Ho],[Northwestern University],"This application claims the benefit, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e), of U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

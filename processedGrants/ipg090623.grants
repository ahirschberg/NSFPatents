07550310,20090623,Techniques and systems for analyte detection,11439136,20060208254,20060921,"Techniques are used to detect and identify analytes. Techniques are used to fabricate and manufacture sensors to detect analytes. An analyte () is sensed by sensors () that output electrical signals in response to the analyte. The electrical signals may be preprocessed () by filtering and amplification. In one embodiment, a plurality of sensors are formed on a single integrated circuit. The sensors may have diverse compositions.",[Rodney M. Goodman][Nathan S. Lewis][Robert H. Grubbs][Jeffery Dickson][Vincent F. Koosh][Richard S. Payne],[California Institute of Technology],"This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser.

07550441,20090623,Controlled release polymer nanoparticle containing bound nucleic acid ligand for targeting,10860918,20050037075,20050217,"The present invention relates to a conjugate that includes a nucleic acid ligand bound to a controlled release polymer system, a pharmaceutical composition that contains the conjugate, and methods of treatment using the conjugate. The controlled release polymer system includes an agent such as a therapeutic, diagnostic, prognostic, or prophylactic agent. The nucleic acid ligand that is bound to the controlled release polymer system, binds selectively to a target, such as a cell surface antigen, and thereby delivers the controlled release polymer system to the target.",[Omid C.

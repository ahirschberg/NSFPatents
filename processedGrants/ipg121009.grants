A probabilistic model is presented for relational clustering, which also provides a principal framework to unify various important clustering tasks including traditional attributes-based clustering, semi-supervised clustering, co-clustering and graph clustering. The model seeks to identify cluster structures for each type of data objects and interaction patterns between different types of objects. Under this model, parametric hard and soft relational clustering algorithms are provided under a large number of exponential family distributions. The algorithms are applicable to relational data of various structures and at the same time unify a number of state-of-the-art clustering algorithms: co-clustering algorithms, the k-partite graph clustering, and semi-supervised clustering based on hidden Markov random fields.","",[The Research Foundation of State University of New York],"",20090810,"This invention was made with government support under award 11S0535162 awarded by the National Science Foundation and FA8750-05-2-0284 awarded by AFRL/IF and award FA9550-06-1-0327 awarded by USAF/AFOSR.

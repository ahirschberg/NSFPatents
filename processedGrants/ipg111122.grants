08062420,20111122,Nonlinear optical crystals and their manufacture and use,11765406,20080043787,20080221,"Described are nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals, including aluminum-borate NLO crystals, that have low concentrations of contaminants that adversely affect the NLO crystal's optical properties, such as compounds that contain transition-metal elements and/or lanthanides, other than yttrium, lanthanum, and lutetium. Some NLO crystals with low concentrations of these contaminants are capable of second harmonic generation at very short wavelengths. Also described are embodiments of a method for making these NLO crystals. Some embodiments involve growing a single NLO crystal, such as an aluminum-borate NLO crystal, from a mixture containing a solvent that is substantially free of harmful contaminants.

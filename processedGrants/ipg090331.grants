07509870,20090331,MEMS capacitive bending and axial strain sensor,11552547,20070256502,20071108,"A three-dimensional micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) capacitive bending and axial strain sensor capacitor is described. Two independent comb structures, incorporating suspended polysilicon interdigitated fingers, are fabricated simultaneously on a substrate that can displace independently of each other while attached to a substrate undergoing bending or axial deformation. A change in spacing between the interdigitated fingers will output a change in capacitance of the sensor and is the primary mode of operation of the device. On the bottom and to the end of each comb structure, a glass pad is attached to the comb structure to allow for ample surface area for affixing the sensor to a substrate. During fabrication, tethers are used to connect each comb structure to maintain equal spacing between the fingers before attachment to the substrate. After attachment, the tethers are broken to allow independent movement of each comb structure.",[Julia W.

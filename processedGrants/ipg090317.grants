The crosstalk jitter induced by adjacent data lines can be equalized by detecting one or more data or state transitions in the adjacent data lines and comparing the timing of the one or more data or state transitions to the timing of one or more data or state transitions on the communication line. The state transitions can be compared to determine a mode and corresponding level of coupling. A time delay contributed by a variable time delay positioned in series with the communication line can be varied based in part on the level of coupling.,[James Buckwalter][Seyed Ali Hajimiri],[California Institute of Technology],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/555,648, filed Mar. 22, 2004, entitled &#x201C;CROSSTALK EQUALIZER,&#x201D; and is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

07155959,20070102,Nanodisk sensor and sensor array,10782720,20040194535,20041007,"The invention provides a sensor array with different nanodisk sensors that may be fabricated by direct site-specific dip-pen nanopatterning (DPN) using precursor inks. The good flow characteristics and strong affinity of the sols to measurement electrodes enable intimate ohmic contact. The measurable, reproducible and proportionate changes in the resistance of the sensors when exposed to trace quantities of oxidative and reducing gases constitute the basis for nanodisk gas sensors. The nanodisk sensors show rapid response and ultra-fast recovery for the detection of nitrogen dioxide and acetic acid vapor. Based on the principles of pattern recognition of the olfactory system, an electronic nose that can “smell” different gaseous species is provided with the multiple nanodisk sensor array. These nanodisk sensors have gas recognition ability, instant response and rapid recovery, compact size and integration with the established microelectronics platform and are well-suited for the on-site and real-time detection of gases.",[Ming Su][Vinayak P.

07157144,20070102,Giant remnant polarization in laser ablated SrBiNbOthin films on Pt/TiO/SiO/Si  substrates,11000161,"","","SrBiNbO(SBN) thin films are deposited on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates using off-axis pulsed laser deposition technique. Off-axis laser ablation avoids plasma damaging of the surface of SBN thin films and is favorable to grow films along the polarization axis (a–b plane). SBN thin films are grown at 350° C. substrate temperature, with 5 mm away from the plasma focus, and annealed at 750° C. for 1 hour in oxygen ambient. These SBN thin films exhibited giant remnant polarization (P) of 50 μC/cmwith coercive field of 190 kV/cm. The fatigue endurance of these SBN thin films was measured at 400 kV/cm and showed minimal (&lt;20%) polarization degradation of up to 10switching cycles. The leakage current density of SBN thin films was found to be about 2×10up to an applied field of 100 kV/cm. The above-mentioned properties of off-axis deposited SBN thin films, makes it a good material for NVRAM devices.",[Ram S. Katiyar][Pijush Battacharya][Rasmi R.

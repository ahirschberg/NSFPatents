07954595,20110607,Lightweight inflatable borehole receiver unit for seismic testing,12644655,"","","A borehole receiver for seismic testing has a support frame and an inflatable membrane configured to form a single, compact unit. The inflatable membrane has at least one sensor, such as an accelerometer affixed to the membrane. The at least one accelerometer may be adhesively affixed to an interior portion of the membrane with a cyanoacrylate adhesive. A pneumatic inflation system is used to inflate the membrane with pressurized air. In use, the membrane is slipped over the support frame and secured with a pair of O-rings. Once the borehole receiver is properly positioned in the borehole, pressurized air from the pneumatic inflation system inflates the membrane such that the at least one accelerometer achieves intimate coupling with a wall of the borehole to accurately measure dynamic seismic waves.",[Michael E.

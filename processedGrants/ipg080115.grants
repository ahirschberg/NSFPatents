07318903,20080115,Photonic sensor particles and fabrication methods,10567917,20060255008,20061116,"The invention is related to optical particles (), use of optical particles in sensing applications, and methods of fabricating optical particles that can target a desired analyte. The invention is also related to the self assembly of individual optical particles. An advantage of the invention is that it includes self-assembling individual photonic crystal sensors onto a target. In an embodiment of the invention, a processed sensor structure having two generally opposing surfaces is provided, wherein each of the opposing surfaces have different surface affinities, with a first optical structure formed on one of the opposing surfaces, and a second optical structure formed on the other of the opposing surfaces. The chemically and optically asymmetric opposing surfaces will spontaneously align at an organic liquid/water interface. Changes in the optical response of at least one of the opposing surfaces indicate the presence of a particular analyte for sensing applications.",[Jamie R. Link][Michael J.

In one form, the silane gas precursor compound is cyclohexadien-2,4-ylsilane, an air-stable liquid, that can be thermolyzed in a pyrolysis process to efficiently generate high purity silane gas. The compounds of the present invention can thus serve as a “point-of-use” precursor for silane gas. ",[Dovas A. Saulys][Thomas F. Kuech][John A.

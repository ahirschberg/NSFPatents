07579146,20090825,Nucleic acid cloning,09897712,20050191623,20050901,"The present invention provides an improved system for linking nucleic acids to one another. In particular, the present invention provides techniques for producing DNA product molecules that may be easily and directly ligated to recipient molecules. The product molecules need not be cleaved with restriction enzymes in order to undergo such ligation. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the DNA product molecules are produced through iterative DNA synthesis reactions, so that the product molecules are amplified products. The invention further provides methods for directed ligation of product molecules (i.e., for selective ligation of certain molecules within a collection of molecules), and also for methods of exon shuffling, in which multiple different product molecules are produced in a single ligation reaction. Preferred embodiments of the invention involve ligation of product molecules encoding functional protein domains, particularly domains naturally found in conserved gene families. The inventive DNA manipulation system is readily integrated with other nucleic acid manipulation systems, such as ribozyme-mediated systems, and also is susceptible to automation.",[Kevin A.

07579757,20090825,Method and micro power generator for generating electrical power from low frequency vibrational energy,10597321,20080136562,20080612,"A method and a micro power generator for generating electrical power from low frequency, vibrational energy includes a frequency up-conversion process. The generator is preferably an electromagnetic, vibration-to-electrical power generator which can efficiently scavenge energy from low frequency external vibrations. The generator up-converts low frequency environmental vibrations to a much higher frequency through a mechanical frequency up-converter, and hence provides efficient energy conversion even at low frequencies. This mechanical frequency up-conversion process can be realized in a number of ways. A magnetic method is described as an example. After frequency up-conversion, voltage is induced on coils mounted on resonators by electromagnetic induction. Due to the movement of the coils on their respective resonating cantilevers with respect to the magnet, voltage is generated on the coils and energy conversion is realized.",[Haluk Kulah][Khalil Najafi],[The Regents Of The University Of Michigan],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser.

07580127,20090825,Polarization lidar for the remote detection of aerosol particle shape,11459267,"","","A polarization lidar system capable of remotely identifying characteristics of atmospheric aerosol particles by transmitting a polarized beam of light and analyzing polarization characteristics of received backscatter is disclosed. The transmitter features high pulse energy to remotely identify aerosol particles with substantially one pulse. The transmitter employs a thin film plate polarizer and a Raman wavelength shifter to achieve eye-safe, single-plane linearly polarized energy. The transmit beam and receiver field of view are coaxial. The receiver employs a telescope, a collimating lens, and a beam splitter. The beam splitter splits the received backscatter into a single-plane polarized beam whose polarization plane is parallel to the plane of transmission and a single-plane polarized beam whose polarization plane is perpendicular to the plane of transmission. Each split beam is directed through separate focusing lenses onto separate detectors. The detector signals are amplified and processed to remotely determine atmospheric aerosol particle characteristics.",[Shane Mayor][Scott Spuler],[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research],"",20060721,The present invention was made with Government support under Cooperative Agreement No. ATM-0301213 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

07580582,20090825,Methods for decoding corrupt JPEG2000 codestreams,10534620,20060056706,20060316,"The present invention provides a method for decoding corrupt codestreams for encoded digital imagery and video and, in particular, JPEG2000 codestreams with improved error resilience properties. The decoding techniques apply to a class of coding algorithms in which the data from underlying images are partitioned, typically to allow decoding of different spatial sections of the image, and the rules governing the dependencies within and perhaps between partitioned sets are known. Corrupt codestreams are decoded with improved image quality by observing the partitions imposed by the underlying algorithm (), detecting an error in a partition set (), analyzing the dependencies within and perhaps between the partitions (), determining what sections of encoded data that follow the error in the partition set can be salvaged (), and decoding those sections (). Even though there might be errors in a particular partition, portions of that partition might still be completely or partially decodable, depending on certain modes or “switches” used during the creation of the codestream.",[Michael W.

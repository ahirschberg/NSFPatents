08392000,20130305,Adaptive notch filter,12795273,20100312365,20101209,"The control of flexible systems is often difficult due to the exact frequencies of the elastic modes being hard to identify. These flexible modes may change over time, or vary between units of the same system. The variation in the modal dynamics may cause a degradation in performance or even instabilities unless compensated for by the control scheme. Controllers designed for these types of systems use notch filters for mode suppression. However variation in the parameters of the flexible modes may cause the need for wide notch filters. An adaptive scheme is proposed which uses an online estimator based on plant parameterization. The scheme may not use probe signals and may not rely on exact parameter identification of the unknown parameters. Instead it may continuously update itself to cancel the effect of the flexible modes by been able to identify the effect of the modal dynamics on the performance of the system. The adaptive notch filter can be designed narrower, adding less phase lag at lower frequencies, thereby allowing an increase in bandwidth and disturbance rejection capability. Simulation and experimental verification of the adaptive mode suppression scheme is given through the use of a laser beam pointing system. The adaptive scheme is compared to a non-adaptive scheme, and is able to decrease the standard deviation of the experimentally measured tracking error by 14% even when the flexible dynamics are unknown.",[Jason Levin][Petros Ioannou],[University of Southern California],"This application is based upon and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/184,583, entitled &#x201C;ADAPTIVE NOTCH FILTER FOR FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS,&#x201D; filed Jun. 5, 2009.

Proper elimination of this blur is challenging because the blur kernel is unknown, varies over the image as a function of object velocity, and destroys high frequencies. In the case of motions along a 1D direction (e.g. horizontal), applicants show that these challenges can be addressed using a camera that moves during the exposure. Through the analysis of motion blur as space-time integration, applicants show that a parabolic integration (corresponding to constant sensor acceleration) leads to motion blur that is not only invariant to object velocity, but preserves image frequency content nearly optimally. That is, static objects are degraded relative to their image from a static camera, but all moving objects within a given range of motions reconstruct well.

Such compressive measurement schemes are desirable in practice for reducing the costs of signal acquisition, storage, and processing. However, the current CS framework considers only a certain task (signal recovery) and only in a certain model setting (sparsity).We show that compressive measurements are in fact information scalable, allowing one to answer a broad spectrum of questions about a signal when provided only with a reduced set of compressive measurements. These questions range from complete signal recovery at one extreme down to a simple binary detection decision at the other. (Questions in between include, for example, estimation and classification.) We provide techniques such as a “compressive matched filter” for answering several of these questions given the available measurements, often without needing to first reconstruct the signal. In many cases, these techniques can succeed with far fewer measurements than would be required for full signal recovery, and such techniques can also be computationally more efficient. Based on additional mathematical insight, we discuss information scalable algorithms in several model settings, including sparsity (as in CS), but also in parametric or manifold-based settings and in model-free settings for generic statements of detection, classification, and estimation problems.",[Richard Baraniuk][Marco F.

Microfluidic systems can provide an advantageous environment for performing various reactions and analysis due to a reduction in sample and reagent quantities that are required, a reduction in the size of the operating system, and a decrease in reaction time compared to conventional systems. Unfortunately, the small size of microfluidic channels can sometimes result in difficulty in detecting a species without magnifying optics (such as a microscope or a photomultiplier). A series of tightly packed microchannels, i.e., a meandering region, or a wide channel having a dimension on the order of millimeters, can serve as a solution to this problem by creating a wide measurement area.

The algorithm progresses iteratively adding a new basis function at each step to refine the model. The placement of the basis functions is driven by a statistical hypothesis test that reveals geometric structure when it fails. At each step the added function is fit to data contained in a spatio-temporally defined local region to determine the parameters, in particular, the scale of the local model. The proposed method requires no ad hoc parameters. Thus, the number of basis functions required for an accurate fit is determined automatically by the algorithm. The approach may be applied to problems including modeling data on manifolds and the prediction of financial time-series.

The system combines computational methods to process images from two different modalities, using Active Shape Model (ASM), spline interpolation, active contours, and wavelet transform. By processing both X-ray and CT images, features which may be visible under one modality and not under the other are extracted and validates and confirms information visible in both. The X-ray component uses hierarchical approach based on directed Hough Transform to detect pelvic structures, removing the need for manual initialization. The X-ray component uses cubic spline interpolation to regulate ASM deformation during X-ray image segmentation. Key regions of the pelvis are first segmented and identified, allowing detection methods to be specialized to each structure using anatomical knowledge. The CT processing component is able to distinguish bone from other non-bone objects with similar visual characteristics, such a blood and contrast fluid, permitting detection and quantification of soft tissue hemorrhage. The CT processing component draws attention to slices where irregularities are detected, reducing the time to fully examine a pelvic CT scan.

By decoupling the frame connecting the sense system to a central anchor, x-y symmetry is preserved while enabling a fully coupled 2-DOF sense mode providing control over both the bandwidth and the amount of coupling independent of operational frequency. The robust mode corresponds to operation between the 2-DOF sense mode resonant frequencies providing a response gain and bandwidth controlled by frequency spacing. Precision mode of operation, however, relies on mode-matching the drive to the second, anti-phase sense mode resonant frequency which can be designed to provide a gain advantage over a similar 1-DOF system.",[Adam Schofield][Alexander Trusov][Andrei Shkel],[The Regents of the University of California],"",20091023,"This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. 0409923, awarded by the National Science Foundation.

In such processes, CNT seeds of a pre-selected diameter and chirality are grown to many (e.g., hundreds) times their original length. This is optionally followed by cycling some of the newly grown material back as seed material for regrowth. Thus, the present invention provides for the large-scale production of precise populations of CNTs, the precise composition of such populations capable of being optimized for a particular application (e.g., hydrogen storage). The present invention is also directed to complexes of CNTs and transition metal catalyst precurors, such complexes typically being formed en route to forming CNT seeds.","[Richard E.

Existing snapshot approaches offer no satisfactory solution to long-lived snapshots. Split snapshots are an approach that is promising because it does not disrupt the current state storage system in either the short or the long run. An unsolved problem has been how to maintain an efficient access method for long-lived split snapshots without imposing undesirable overhead on the storage system. Skippy is a new approach that inexpensively indexes long-lived snapshots in parallel with snapshot creation. An embodiment of Skippy uses append-only index data structures to optimize writes while simultaneously providing low-latency snapshot lookup.

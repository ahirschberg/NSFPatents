The current source frequency is tuned to the resonance frequency of the equivalent RLC circuit, which effectively eliminates the capacitive and inductive components of the impedance, leaving only purely resistive components. The output of the equivalent RLC circuit is connected to a high input impedance buffer amplifier and then to a phase sensitive detector, which detects the phase shift resulting from the equivalent RLC circuit. The output is filtered and a differencing amplifier is used to zero out the output signal due to the system components and the sample cell buffer solution prior to taking active readings.

These flexible modes may change over time, or vary between units of the same system. The variation in the modal dynamics may cause a degradation in performance or even instabilities unless compensated for by the control scheme. Controllers designed for these types of systems use notch filters for mode suppression. However variation in the parameters of the flexible modes may cause the need for wide notch filters. An adaptive scheme is proposed which uses an online estimator based on plant parameterization. The scheme may not use probe signals and may not rely on exact parameter identification of the unknown parameters. Instead it may continuously update itself to cancel the effect of the flexible modes by been able to identify the effect of the modal dynamics on the performance of the system. The adaptive notch filter can be designed narrower, adding less phase lag at lower frequencies, thereby allowing an increase in bandwidth and disturbance rejection capability. Simulation and experimental verification of the adaptive mode suppression scheme is given through the use of a laser beam pointing system.

Stakeholder values relevant for a software system are identified. The identified stakeholder values are quantified using a quantitative decision making approach to prioritize vulnerabilities of the software system. A structured attack graph is generated to include the quantified stakeholder values to define a scalable framework to evaluate attack scenarios. The structured attack graph includes two or more nodes. Based on the generated structured attack graph, structured attack paths are identified with each attack path representing each attack scenario.",[Yue Chen][Barry W.

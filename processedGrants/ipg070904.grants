07264314,20070904,Adrenocorticotropic hormone analogs and related methods,11260551,20060128620,20060615,"ACTH analog compounds of the present invention include compounds comprising an ACTH peptide sequence with one or more structural modifications that can have one or more of the following preferred ACTH analog biological functions: (1) reduction of corticosteroid secretion by adrenal membrane in the presence of the ACTH analog compared to unmodified ACTH, (2) reduction of corticosteroid secretion by adrenal membrane in the presence of endogenous ACTH and (3) increased MC-2R binding affinity with reduced activation of the MC-2R receptor compared to unmodified ACTH binding to the MC-2R melanocortin. The ACTH analog compounds of the present invention are therefore useful for treatment or prevention of diseases and disorders related to ACTH, ACTH receptors or corticosteroid secretion, such as premature labor and Cushing's Disease.",[Miles B.

The size distribution of the QDs is chosen to allow light of a particular color to be emitted therefrom. The light emitted from the device may be of either a pure (monochromatic) color, or a mixed (polychromatic) color, and may consist solely of light emitted from the QDs themselves, or of a mixture of light emitted from the QDs and light emitted from the primary source. The QDs desirably are composed of an undoped semiconductor such as CdSe, and may optionally be overcoated to increase photoluminescence.",[Moungi E. Bawendi][Jason Heine][Klavs F. Jensen][Jeffrey N.

Alternatively, the diquaternary ammonium salts may be adsorbed or chemically bonded to a substrate, and the metal anion complex-containing solution passed over the substrate. Preferably, the two quaternary nitrogens are spaced a distance apart that is complementary to the ionic diameter of the target metal anion complex. Typically, the platinum group metal halide anion complexes have a valence of −2 and each of the two quaternary nitrogens of the diquaternary ammonium salt have a valence of +1, such that the organo-metallic complex formed is a stable pair.",[Waheguru Pal Singh],"[Lynntech, Inc.]","This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser.

Also provided are peptide conjugates prepared from such synthons, and synthon and conjugate preparation methods including procedures for identifying optimum probe attachment sites. Biosensors are provided having functional molecules that can locate and bind to specific biomolecules within living cells. Biosensors can detect chemical and physiological changes in those biomolecules as living cells are moving, metabolizing and reacting to its environment. Methods are included for detecting GTP activation of a Rho GTPase protein using polypeptide biosensors. When the biosensor binds GTP-activated Rho GTPase protein, an environmentally sensitive dye emits a signal of a different lifetime, intensity or wavelength than when not bound. New fluorophores whose fluorescence responds to environmental changes are also provided that have improved detection and attachment properties, and that can be used in living cells, or in vitro.",[Klaus M.

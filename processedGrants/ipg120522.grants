08181540,20120522,Measurement of sliding friction-induced vibrations for biomimetic tactile sensing,12417532,20100139418,20100610,"Tactile sensors are disclosed that mimic the human fingertip and its touch receptors. The mechanical components are similar to a fingertip, with a rigid core surrounded by a weakly conductive fluid contained within an elastomeric skin. The deformable properties of the finger pad can be used as part of a transduction process. Multiple electrodes can be mounted on the surface of the rigid core and connected to impedance measuring circuitry within the core. External forces deform the fluid path around the electrodes, resulting in a distributed pattern of impedance changes containing information about those forces and the objects that applied them. Strategies are described for extracting features related to the mechanical inputs and using this information for reflexive grip control. Controlling grip force in a prosthetic having sensory feedback information is described. Pressure transducers can provide sensory feedback by measuring micro-vibrations due to sliding friction.","",[University of Southern California],"This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent application Ser.

07255192,20070814,Actuated tether,10973622,20060097682,20060511,"A self-actuating robot or vehicle tether capable of moving itself, remaining free while traversing around obstacles, and free itself is disclosed. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a valve is mounted to the tether or robot. An inflow conduit attached to or in the tether is connected to the valve. A fluid flows through the tether and the valve is opened and closed to create a waterhammer effect in the inflow conduit. The forces created on the tether from the waterhammer effect result in motion of the tether and in freeing of the tether from obstructions. Closing and opening the valve further creates pressure changes in the tether, thereby causing momentary dimensional changes in the tether. In an alternative embodiment, a plurality of valves are placed along the tether. Pulsing of the plurality of valves while a fluid flows through the tether results in the tether effectively moving itself.",[Douglas P.

07255332,20070814,System and method for dissolving gases in liquids,11137856,20050279713,20051222,"Apparatus and methods for dissolving a gas into a liquid comprises a saturation tank, a high pressure liquid pump in fluid communication with the tank, and a pressurized gas source in communication with a regulated gas head space of the saturation tank. The saturation tank comprises a pressure vessel for containing the liquid and has a regulated gas head space above the liquid, contains at least one liquid spray nozzle that permits passage of liquid into the pressure vessel, and an outlet for the liquid containing dissolved gas. Upon passing the gas-containing liquid into a second fluid, the gas is released in the form of microbubbles. The microbubbles aid in flocculation of suspended particles and promote dissolution of the gas in the second fluid. Preferred gases for use with the apparatus are oxygen, air, and ozone. Anticipated uses include treatment of rivers, streams, and ponds in natural or industrial settings, as well as smaller scale applications.",[Gregory Scott Osborn][Marty D. Matlock][Shandi S.

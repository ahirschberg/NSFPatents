07854174,20101221,MEMS capacitive bending and axial strain sensor,12393294,20090188325,20090730,"A three-dimensional micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) capacitive bending and axial strain sensor capacitor is described. Two independent comb structures, incorporating suspended polysilicon interdigitated fingers, are fabricated simultaneously on a substrate that can displace independently of each other while attached to a substrate undergoing bending or axial deformation. A change in spacing between the interdigitated fingers will output a change in capacitance of the sensor and is the primary mode of operation of the device. On the bottom and to the end of each comb structure, a glass pad is attached to the comb structure to allow for ample surface area for affixing the sensor to a substrate. During fabrication, tethers are used to connect each comb structure to maintain equal spacing between the fingers before attachment to the substrate. After attachment, the tethers are broken to allow independent movement of each comb structure.",[Julia W.

An exemplary incubator comprises an optically accessible enclosure having a plurality of fluidic ports. A heating element is disposed within the enclosure that is coupled to an external heater controller. An autoclavable microfluidic perfusion chamber is disposed within the enclosure that comprises a cell culture life support chamber, an inlet port disposed in the perfusion chamber, a collection chamber in communication with the culture chamber, an outlet port coupled to the collection pool, and a perfusing substrate. An optically transparent, gas permeable membrane is attachable to the top of the perfusion chamber. The incubators have optical accessibility, forced flow fluidic control, temperature control, are portable and modular, and are inexpensively manufactured. The incubators permit in-the-field drug testing and culturing of biological tissues.",[Jelena Vukasinovic][Ari Glezer],[Georgia Tech Research Corporation],"This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application entitled &#x201C;LOW-COST, CENTIMETER-SCALE, INTEGRATED DIAGNOSTICS INCUBATOR FOR BIOLOGICAL CULTURING&#x201D; having Ser.

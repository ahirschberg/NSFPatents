The nanoliter rheometer comprises two very thin fibers, the ends of which are in close proximity to one another and desirably parallel to one another with one fiber being moved by a drive system and the remaining fiber desirably being stationary and capable of measuring a force transferred through a nanoliter size fluid located between the two fibers ends. The transferred force can be measured either by an LCR meter or a piezoelectric crystal and recorded as by a lock-in amplifier.",[Antal Istvan Jákli][Christopher Allen Bailey],[Kent State University],"This patent application claims the benefit and priority of U.S. provisional application 61/066,184, filed Feb. 19, 2008 for BROAD-RANGE NANOLITER RHEOMETER, which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.",20090211,The U.S. Government may have certain rights in this invention under the National Science Foundation FRG under Contract No. DMS-0456221.,"","","",""
08057857,20111115,Phase separation in patterned structures,11480557,20070087172,20070419,"Novel phase-separation behavior by a mixture, including binary mixture, of patterning compounds, including alkanethiols, when deposited onto a surface, including a gold surface, using micro and nano-deposition tools such as tip and stamp methods like micro-contact printing (μCP), and Dip-Pen Nanolithography (DPN). This behavior is significantly different than that observed in the bulk. This behavior was demonstrated using three examples of compounds: 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA), 1-octadecanethiol (ODT), and CF(CF)(CH)SH (PFT). The identity of the resulting segregated structure was confirmed by lateral force microscopy (LFM), and by selective metal-organic coordination chemistry. This phenomenon is exploited to print sub-100 nm wide alkanethiol features via conventional μCP and to form sub-15 nm features using DPN printing, which is below the ultimate resolution of both these techniques. These nano-patterned materials also can serve as templates for constructing more complex architectures.",[Chad A.

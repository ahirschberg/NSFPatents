08496844,20130730,Ion etching of growing InP nanocrystals using microwave,13645876,"","","High quantum yield InP nanocrystals are used in the bio-technology, bio-medical, and photovoltaic, specifically IV, III-V and III-VI nanocrystal technological applications. InP nanocrystals typically require post-generation HF treatment. Combining microwave methodologies with the presence of a fluorinated ionic liquid allows Fluorine ion etching without the hazards accompanying HF. Growing the InP nanocrystals in the presence of the ionic liquid allows in-situ etching to be achieved. The optimization of the PL QY is achieved by balancing growth and etching rates in the reaction.",[Geoffrey F. Strouse][Derek D.

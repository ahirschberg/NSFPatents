07317540,20080108,Method of full-color optical coherence tomography,11290848,"","","Two-dimensional and three-dimensional optical coherence tomography is obtained by differential imaging of full-frame interference images using a white light source. Full-color tomographic imaging is also possible by processing the three-color channels of the interference images. A technique is described to obtain two-dimensional OCT images with full natural color representation. In a particular embodiment, the interference image is acquired using a color camera and the three-color channels are processed separately, recomposing the final image. In an additional embodiment, the interference images are acquired using separate red, blue and green light sources and the three color channels are combined to recompose the final image.",[Myung K. Kim][Lingfeng Yu],[University of South Florida],"This application is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 11/063,499 filed on Feb. 22, 2005, now U.S. Pat.

07317764,20080108,Method of signal transmission to multiple users from a multi-element array,10459900,20040253986,20041216,"A communication method is provided, in which a data vector u which contains respective signal data destined for each of a plurality of users is transmitted from multiple antennas or other transmitting elements. Prior to transmission, a perturbation vector τl is added to the data vector u, in which τ is a positive real number and each component of the vector l is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are both integers. This perturbation is beneficial for improving the total rate of data transmission.",[Bertrand M Hochwald][Christian Bruce Peel],[Lucent Technologies Inc.],"",20030611,This invention was made with Government support under Wireless Initiative Grant CCR-9979452 and Information Technology Grant CCR-0081476 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

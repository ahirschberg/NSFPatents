07393443,20080701,Methods of identifying kinetically stable proteins,10924235,20050069957,20050331,"The present invention provides a fast and efficient means for identifying kinetically stable proteins. As used herein the term “kinetically stable protein” means a protein that is trapped in a specific conformation due to an unusually high unfolding barrier that results in very slow unfolding rates. The present inventors are the first to discover the existence of a correlation between kinetic stability and SDS-induced denaturation. Thus, the invention provides methods for identifying kinetically stable proteins comprising the step of testing the proteins for resistance to denaturation by SDS. In one embodiment, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is one simple method for quickly identifying and selecting kinetically stable proteins.",[Wilfredo Colón][Marta Manning],[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/496,778, filed on Aug. 21, 2003.

07394065,20080701,Chemical probe using field-induced droplet ionization mass spectrometry,11390695,20060249672,20061109,"A method and apparatus for probing the chemistry of a single droplet are provided. The technique uses a variation of the field-induced droplet ionization (FIDI) method, in which isolated droplets undergo heterogeneous reactions between solution phase analytes and gas-phase species. Following a specified reaction time, the application of a high electric field induces FIDI in the droplet, generating fine jets of highly charged progeny droplets that can then be characterized. Sampling over a range of delay times following exposure of the droplet to gas phase reactants, the spectra yield the temporal variation of reactant and product concentrations. Following the initial mass spectrometry studies, we developed an experiment to explore the parameter space associated with FIDI in an attempt to better understand and control the technique. In an alternative embodiment of the invention switched electric fields are integrated with the technique to allow for time-resolved studies of the droplet distortion, jetting, and charged progeny droplet formation associated with FIDI.","[Ronald L.

Quasi-particle interferometry is a tool for constructing topologically protected gates. Assuming the corrections of the Moore-Read Model for ν=5/2's FQHE (Nucl. Phys. B 360, 362 (1991)) we show how to manipulate the collective state of two e/4-charge anti-dots in order to switch said collective state from one carrying trivial SU(2) charge, |1&gt;, to one carrying a fermionic SU(2) charge |∈&gt;. This is a NOT gate on the {|1&gt;, |∈&gt;} qubit and is effected by braiding of an electrically charged quasi particle a which carries an additional SU(2)-charge. Read-out is accomplished by σ-particle interferometry.",[Michael H. Freedman][Chetan V.

The shape changes include any motion that makes the surface more effective at performing its function, such as expansion, shrinkage, twisting, encircling, wiggling, swallowing or constricting. The shape-shifting surfaces include tiled arrays of polygonal cells, each cell including specifically-designed compliant flexures attached to specifically-shaped overlapping thin plates or shells. The surfaces remain stable by leveraging them during deformation to an extent that they cannot spontaneously return to the unstressed shape. Applications for such surfaces include micro-scale cellular engineering and macro-scale biomedical applications, recreational uses, national security, and environmental protection.",[Craig Perry Lusk][Paul Joseph Montalbano],[University of South Florida],"This application is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority to currently U.S. patent application Ser.

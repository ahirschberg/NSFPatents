07278298,20071009,Scanner for probe microscopy,11000589,20060112760,20060601,"A scanner for probe microscopy that avoids low resonance frequencies and accounts better for piezo nonlinearities. The x, y and z axes of a linear stack scanner are partially decoupled from each other while maintaining all mechanical joints stiff in the direction of actuation. The scanning probe microscope comprises a probe, a housing, at least two actuators, each coupled to the housing, and a support coupled to the housing and to at least a first of the actuators at a position spaced from the point at which the actuator is coupled to the housing. The support constrains the motion of the first actuator along a first axis while permitting translation along a second axis. The actuators are preferably orthogonally arranged linear stacks of flat piezos, preferably in push-pull configuration. The support can take different forms in different embodiments of the invention. In a particular embodiment, the scanner is a 2D scanner having a support frame with x and y axes, and a member for supporting an object to be moved such as a sample for a probe, the scanner comprising a flexure and flexure coupled cross-conformed piezos arranged along x and y axes. Expansion of the piezos is measured by at least two strain gauges disposed to measure the differential motion of at least two opposed actuators. The strain gauges are preferably arranged to compensate for ambient temperature changes, and preferably two or more strain gauges of identical type are disposed on each actuator to magnify the strain signal.",[Paul K.

07279534,20071009,Poly(heteroaromatic) block copolymers with electrical conductivity,10234968,20030088032,20030508,"The present invention provides block copolymers containing at least one block of a poly(heteroaromatic) polymer and at least two blocks of a non-conjugated polymer. The chemically different blocks of the copolymer are covalently bonded to each other in an alternating fashion through an appropriate linkage group. The poly(heteroaromatic) block may exist in its neutral or oxidized form, and when in the oxidized form, it associates with organic or inorganic counter-anions to balance the charge. The poly(heteroaromatic) polymer is an intrinsically conducting polymer (ICP), and when in the oxidized form it is electrically conducting. When the ICP block or blocks of the block copolymer are in the doped form, the block copolymer is electrically conducting. Preferably the conducting block copolymers have conductivities in the range 10-10S/cm.

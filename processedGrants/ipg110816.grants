07997123,20110816,Nanotipped device and method,11820328,20080131325,20080605,"A dispensing device has a cantilever comprising a plurality of thin films arranged relative to one another to define a microchannel in the cantilever and to define at least portions of a dispensing microtip proximate an end of the cantilever and communicated to the microchannel to receive material therefrom. The microchannel is communicated to a reservoir that supplies material to the microchannel. One or more reservoir-fed cantilevers may be formed on a semiconductor chip substrate. A sealing layer preferably is disposed on one of the first and second thin films and overlies outermost edges of the first and second thin films to seal the outermost edges against material leakage. Each cantilever includes an actuator, such as for example a piezoelectric actuator, to impart bending motion thereto. The microtip includes a pointed pyramidal or conical shaped microtip body and an annular shell spaced about the pointed microtip body to define a material-dispensing annulus thereabout. The working microtip may be used to dispense material onto a substrate, to probe a surface in scanning probe microscopy, to apply an electrical stimulus or record an electrical response on a surface in the presence of a local environment created around the tip by the material dispensed from the tip or to achieve other functions.",[Horacio D.

07999622,20110816,Adaptive phase noise cancellation for fractional-N phase locked loop,12352293,20100039182,20100218,"An embodiment of the invention is a circuit for adaptive phase noise cancellation for a fractional-N PLL. A preferred embodiment employs a split loop filter architecture. Two loop filter halves separately drive half-sized parallel varactors in a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and also drive a differential-input lowpass frequency selective circuit, e.g., a differential-input integrator in a least mean squared (LMS) feedback loop. The output of the differential-input lowpass frequency selective circuit controls the gain matching of a phase noise cancellation path to minimize phase noise arising from quantization error associated with the sequence of divider modulus values in the fractional-N PLL. The two varactor capacitances add together in the VCO tank, so the VCO frequency depends on the common-mode loop filter voltage and is relatively insensitive to differential-mode voltage. In contrast, the differential integrator operates on the differential-mode voltage from the two loop filter halves but attenuates their common-mode voltage.",[Ian Galton][Ashok Swaminathan],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119 from prior provisional application Ser.

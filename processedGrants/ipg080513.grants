The particles are homogeneous in size and are comprised of a nonconducting inner layer that is surrounded by an electrically conducting material. The ratio of the thickness of the nonconducting layer to the thickness of the outer conducting shell is determinative of the wavelength of maximum absorbance or scattering of the particle. Unique solution phase methods for synthesizing the particles involve linking clusters of the conducting atoms, ions, or molecules to the nonconducting inner layer by linear molecules. This step can be followed by growth of the metal onto the clusters to form a coherent conducting shell that encapsulates the core.",[Steven J. Oldenburg][Richard D. Averitt][Nancy J.

Permanent polymer micro-structures are formed from a liquid crystal with a non-uniform spatially modulated director field. The polymer structures have the shape and spatial location dictated by the non-uniform director field of the liquid crystal. The micro-structures are a backbone that restores the liquid crystal director field that existed during the polymerization process even when other factors, such as electric field, temperature, or surface anchoring, do not favor this restoration. The polymer micro-structures can be used in optical devices, such as diffraction gratings and deflecting and beam steering devices, and in micro-mechanical and micro-fluidic devices.",[Oleg D.

Specifically, the present invention is an extension of linguistic methods to the mathematical domain thereby providing recognition of the artificial language of mathematics in a way analogous to natural language recognition. Parse trees are the basic units of the mathematical language, and a linguistic model for mathematics is a method for assigning a linguistic score to each parse tree. The models are generally created by taking a large body of known text and counting the occurrence of various linguistic events such as word bigrams in that body. The raw counts are modified by smoothing and other algorithms before taking their place as probabilities in the model.",[Peter F.

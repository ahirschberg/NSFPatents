08536879,20130917,Rotating electric-field sensor,12992510,20110062968,20110317,"A compact instrument package consisting of a rotating sensor and supporting signal-processing electronics is capable of measuring two-dimensional electric-field vectors, ranging from DC to an arbitrary upper AC frequency not limited by the rotation rate, with highly improved accuracy and sensitivity when compared with previous art. In addition, contrary to previous art, the sensor can measure the electric field gradient at its location. This is achieved by the use of a combination of quadrature modulation and phase-sensitive quadrature demodulation digital signal processing in a generic rotating electric-field sensor. Ground isolated versions of the instrument can be used singly or in arrays when precise measurements of the electric fields are necessary. Either grounded or isolated versions of the instrument can operate continuously without the need for internal batteries, making it extremely attractive for a wide-range of industrial and space applications. Operational modes have been developed to distinguish the effects of ion currents and charged particles impacting the sensor from the local ambient electric field. Moreover, particular versions of the instrument can be operated in corrosive environments and conducting fluids.",[Nilton O. Renno][Steven A.

The system combines computational methods to process images from two different modalities, using Active Shape Model (ASM), spline interpolation, active contours, and wavelet transform. By processing both X-ray and CT images, features which may be visible under one modality and not under the other are extracted and validates and confirms information visible in both. The X-ray component uses hierarchical approach based on directed Hough Transform to detect pelvic structures, removing the need for manual initialization. The X-ray component uses cubic spline interpolation to regulate ASM deformation during X-ray image segmentation. Key regions of the pelvis are first segmented and identified, allowing detection methods to be specialized to each structure using anatomical knowledge. The CT processing component is able to distinguish bone from other non-bone objects with similar visual characteristics, such a blood and contrast fluid, permitting detection and quantification of soft tissue hemorrhage.

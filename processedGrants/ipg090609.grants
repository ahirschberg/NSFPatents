07543496,20090609,Capacitive bulk acoustic wave disk gyroscopes,11601956,20070220971,20070927,"Capacitive bulk acoustic wave x, y and z-axes gyroscopes implemented on (100) and (111) silicon substrates are disclosed. Exemplary gyroscopes comprise a handle substrate, a bulk acoustic wave resonator element supported by the handle substrate, and a plurality of electrodes surrounding and separated from the resonator element by very small capacitive gaps. The electrodes can excite and detect at least two degenerate bulk acoustic wave resonant modes in the resonator. Advantages include reduced size; higher Q, which improves noise and bias stability; larger bandwidth, and improved shock resistance. In addition, the high Q is maintained in atmospheric or near-atmospheric pressure which reduces the cost and complexity of the wafer-scale packaging of the gyroscope.",[Farrokh Ayazi][Houri Johari],[Georgia Tech Research Corporation],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/786,304, filed Mar. 27, 2006.",20061120,This invention was made with Government support under Agreement No. ECS-0301900 awarded by the National Science Foundation of the United States.

07544496,20090609,Process for making organic/inorganic composites,11432941,20060204580,20060914,"The subject invention concerns a composite comprising an organic fluid-swellable, fibrous matrix, such as collagen, and a mineral phase, such as calcium carbonate or phosphate mineral phase, for use as a biomimetic of bone. In another aspect, the subject invention concerns a process for making a composite involving the inclusion of acidic polymers to a supersaturated mineralizing solution, in order to induce an amorphous liquid-phase precursor to the inorganic mineral, which is then absorbed (pulled by capillary action) into the organic matrix. Advantageously, once solidified, a high mineral content can be achieved, with the inorganic mineral crystals embedded within the collagen fibers (intrafibrillarly) and oriented such that they are aligned along the long axes of the fibers of the organic matrix, thereby closely mimicking the natural structure of bone. The present invention further concerns a method of treating a patient suffering from a bone defect by applying a biomimetic composite to the bone defect site.",[Laurie B. Gower][Matthew J.

07544518,20090609,Rapid quantitative analysis of proteins or protein function in complex mixtures,10994815,20050233399,20051020,"Analytical reagents and mass spectrometry-based methods using these reagents for the rapid, and quantitative analysis of proteins or protein function in mixtures of proteins. The methods employ affinity labeled protein reactive reagents having three portions: an affinity label (A) covalently linked to a protein reactive group (PRG) through a linker group (L). The linker may be differentially isotopically labeled, e.g., by substitution of one or more atoms in the linker with a stable isotope thereof. These reagents allow for the selective isolation of peptide fragments or the products of reaction with a given protein (e.g., products of enzymatic reaction) from complex mixtures. The isolated peptide fragments or reaction products are characteristic of the presence of a protein or the presence of a protein function in those mixtures. Isolated peptides or reaction products are characterized by mass spectrometric (MS) techniques. The reagents also provide for differential isotopic labeling of the isolated peptides or reaction products which facilitates quantitative determination by mass spectrometry of the relative amounts of proteins in different samples. The methods of this invention can be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of global protein expression profiles in cells and tissues, to screen for and identify proteins whose expression level in cells, tissue or biological fluids is affected by a stimulus or by a change in condition or state of the cell, tissue or organism from which the sample originated.",[Rudolf Hans Aebersold][Michael H.

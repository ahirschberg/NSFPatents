08434524,20130507,Elastic hydraulic accumulator/reservoir system,13017118,20120192979,20120802,"The invention is a combination accumulator and reservoir which stores energy when the accumulator deforms from its original shape in response to the flow of a pressurized fluid from the reservoir. The stored energy is returned when the fluid flow is reversed and the accumulator discharges the fluid and returns to its original shape. At least one part of the novelty of the invention is that the accumulator and the fluid reservoir reside in the same housing such that the volume of each varies inversely. Accordingly, the invention is more compact and weighs less than conventional accumulators. Another feature of the invention is that fluid is located around the bladder accumulator to lubricate contact between the bladder and sides of the reservoir.",[Eric J. Barth][Alexander V. Pedchenko],[Vanderbilt University],"",20110131,"This invention was made, in part, with federal grant money under the National Science Foundation's Engineering Research Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power, grant number 0540834.

08435418,20130507,Ion etching of growing InP nanocrystals using microwave,13645855,20130043210,20130221,"High quantum yield InP nanocrystals are used in the bio-technology, bio-medical, and photovoltaic, specifically IV, III-V and III-VI nanocrystal technological applications. InP nanocrystals typically require post-generation HF treatment. Combining microwave methodologies with the presence of a fluorinated ionic liquid allows Fluorine ion etching without the hazards accompanying HF. Growing the InP nanocrystals in the presence of the ionic liquid allows in-situ etching to be achieved. The optimization of the PL QY is achieved by balancing growth and etching rates in the reaction.",[Geoffrey F. Strouse][Derek D.

08436076,20130507,Method for producing polyester nanocomposites,11845497,20080113189,20080515,A method for preparing a polyester nanocomposite is presented. The method comprises coating nanoparticles with a dicarboxylic acid. Combining the dicarboxylic acid coated nanoparticles with a coupling agent resulting in a first mixture. Then combining the first mixture with a polyester to form a polyester nanocomposite. The resulting polyester nanocomposite has among other properties a glass transition temperature greater than the polyester itself and also a crystallization temperature less than the polyester itself.,[Praveen Bhimaraj][Crayton Gregory Toney][Linda S.

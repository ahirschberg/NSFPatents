Peptides, proteins, fusion proteins, protein complexes, nucleic acids, and the like, are labeled with an acrylic moiety and attached to acrylic-functionalized glass surfaces through a copolymerization with acrylic monomer. The specific attachment of glutathione S-transferase-green fluorescent protein (GST-GFP) fusion protein was more than 7-fold greater than the nonspecific attachment of non-acrylic labeled GST-GFP. Surface-attached GST-GFP (0.32 ng/mm) was detectable by direct measurement of green fluorescent protein fluorescence and this lower detection limit was reduced to 0.080 ng/mmusing indirect antibody-based detection. The polyacrylamide-based surface attachment strategy was also used to measure the kinetics of substrate phosphorylation by the kinase c-Src which is encoded by the Rous Sarcoma virus. The surface attachment strategy is applicable to the proteomics field and addresses denaturation and dehydration problems associated with protein microarray development.",[Shawn B.

07479632,20090120,E-beam vision system for monitoring and control,11341154,"","","A method of characterizing an electron beam is described, comprising providing a system including an electron gun having a steering coil. A material having a surface is also provided. An electron beam from said electron gun is directed to said surface. The directing includes providing a first current to the steering coil to direct the electron beam to a first point on the surface and then providing a second current to the steering coil to direct the electron beam to a second point on the surface. An imaging system is mounted for viewing said surface. An image is collected based on light emitted from the surface because of the electron beam directed at the first point and the second point. A light intensity is determined at the first point and at the second point.",[Michael Alan Gevelber][Adam Scott Brewster][Brian Louis Vattiat],[Trustees of Boston University][Cyber Materials LLC],"This application claims priority of provisional application 60/648,776 filed Feb. 1, 2005, incorporated herein by reference.",20060127,This invention was made with Government support under contract number DMI-0339988 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

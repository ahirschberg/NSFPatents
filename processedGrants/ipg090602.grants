07541312,20090602,Porous carbons from carbohydrates,10955376,20050207962,20050922,"A porous carbon characterized by a volumetric pore size distribution having two peaks, a first of said peaks being between 0.5 and 1.0 nm and a second of said peaks being between 1.0 and 5.0 nm. The porous carbon may have a volumetric capacitance in an organic electrolyte of at least 40 F/cm, an average pore diameter between about 2 nm and about 30 nm, a surface area of at least 900 m/g, and/or a density of at least 0.4 g/cm. A method for making such a carbon includes a) curing a mixture comprising a carbohydrate, a dehydrating component, and a nonmetallic cationic pore-forming agent and b) carbonizing the cured carbon under conditions effective to provide a porous carbon having a surface area between about 100 m/g and about 3000 m/g.

07541412,20090602,Process for preparation of polyolefins via degenerative transfer polymerization,11698975,20070203310,20070830,"Disclosed is a method of producing a polyolefin composition comprising contacting a metallocene pre-catalyst with a substoichiometric amount of a co-catalyst; adding a first olefin monomer; and polymerizing the first monomer for a time sufficient to form the polyolefin. The method allows for the use of a minimum amount of activating co-catalyst, and allows for the production of stereoregular and non-stereoregular polyolefins. The use of configurationally stable metallocene pre-catalysts allows for the production of monomodal isotactic polyolefins having narrow polydispersity. The use of configurationally unstable metallocene pre-catalysts allows for the production of monomodal atactic polyolefins having narrow polydispersity. The method of the present invention optionally further comprises contacting the polyolefin with a second amount of said co-catalyst; adding a second olefin monomer; polymerizing said second olefin monomer to form a block-polyolefin composition. Also disclosed are monomodal diblock copolymer compositions made according to the present invention.",[Lawrence R.

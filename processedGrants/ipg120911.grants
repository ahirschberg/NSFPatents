08261668,20120911,"Propulsion vehicle which travels along a soft, porous track",13001997,20110308422,20111222,"A vehicle track including a soft porous material and a vehicle which rides on the track by skiing cm the soft porous material. The vehicle has a large ski surface that rides on the soft porous material, supporting the weight of the vehicle at high speeds. Air within the soft porous material supplies most of the lift needed to support the train, Only a small amount of the support is provided by the structure of the porous material itself when the vehicle is in motion. As a result, the friction between the soft porous material and the ski surface may also be exceedingly small. To increase the amount of lift provided by the soft porous material it can be contained within a channel having impermeable sides and bottom. If the ski surface is substantially the same width as the channel, the impermeable sides prevent the air from escaping on either side of die ski surface. Accordingly, the trapped air contributes to greatly enhanced lift force. At lower speeds the vehicle can use wheels to support some or all of its weight. These wheels can ride on rails that are part of the track. The vehicle includes a propulsion system that is independent of the wheels so that it may travel over the soft porous material without running on the wheels.","",[Research Foundation of the City University of New York],"This application is the U.S. national stage under 35 USC &#xA7;371 of International Application Number PCT/US2009/049260, filed on Jun. 30, 2009, which claims the benefit of priority under 35 USC &#xA7;119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/077,382, filed Jul. 1, 2008, which are both is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.",20090630,The U.S. Government may have certain rights to the invention based on National Science Foundation grant #0432229 and National Institutes of Health grant HL44485.,"","",20110902,PCT/US2009/049260

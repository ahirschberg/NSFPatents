In one embodiment, the oscillator is disc of material supported by a pillar of much smaller diameter than the disc. The periphery of the disc is heated to modify the resonant frequency (or equivalently the spring constant or stiffness) of the disc. Continuous control of the output phase and frequency may be achieved when the oscillator becomes synchronized with an imposed sinusoidal force of close frequency. The oscillator frequency can be detuned to produce an easily controlled phase differential between the injected signal and the oscillator feedback.

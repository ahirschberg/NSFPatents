07514219,20090407,Method for distinguishing between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma,11560410,20070264644,20071115,"The present invention is a method distinguishing between head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. In particular, a 10-gene classifier has been identified which can be used to distinguish between primary squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. These genes include CXCL13, COL6A2, SFTPB, KRT14, TSPYL5, TMP3, KLK10, MMP1, GAS1, and MYH2. A panel of one or more of these genes, or proteins encoded thereby, can be used for early diagnosis and selection of an appropriate therapeutic treatment.",[Louise C.

07514248,20090407,Process for making organic/inorganic composites,10418843,20030232071,20031218,"The subject invention concerns a composite comprising an organic fluid-swellable matrix, such as collagen, and mineral phase, such as calcium carbonate or phosphate mineral phase, for use as a biomimetic of bone. In another aspect, the subject invention concerns a process for making a composite involving the inclusion of acidic polymers to a supersaturated mineralizing solution, in order to induce an amorphous liquid-phase precursor to the inorganic mineral, which is then absorbed (pulled by capillary action) into the interstices of the organic matrix, and subsequently mineralizes via solidification and crystallization of the precursor phase.

Advantageously, once solidified, a high mineral content can be achieved, with the inorganic mineral crystals embedded within the collagen fibers (intrafibrillarly) and oriented such that they are aligned along the long axes of the fibers of the organic matrix, thereby closely mimicking the natural structure of bone.

07514764,20090407,Materials and methods for creating imaging layers,11386226,20070020749,20070125,"The present invention provides patterned features of dimensions of less than 50 nm on a substrate. According to various embodiments, the features may be “Manhattan” style structures, have high aspect ratios, and/or have atomically smooth surfaces. The patterned features are made from polymer brushes grafted to a substrate. In some embodiments, the dimensions of the features may be determined by adjusting the grafting density and/or the molecular weight of the brushes. Once the brushes are patterned, the features can be shaped and reshaped with thermal or solvent treatments to achieve the desired profiles. The chemical nature of the polymer brush is thus independent of the patterning process, which allows for optimization of the polymer brush used for specific applications. Applications include masks for pattern transfer techniques such as reactive ion etching.",[Paul F Nealey][Tushar S. Jain][Erik W.

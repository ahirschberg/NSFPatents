07276374,20071002,Enhanced plant cell transformation by addition of host genes involved in T-DNA integration,10766389,20050125855,20050609,"Adding at least one gene involved in plant host cell T-DNA integration enhances transformation by . The histone H2A gene encoded by the RAT5 gene increases transformation frequencies of plants, most likely by causing overexpression of a product needed for T-DNA integration. genetically transforms plant cells by transferring a portion of the bacterial Ti-plasmid, designated the T-DNA, to the plant, and integrating the T-DNA into the plant genome. However, not all plants are transformable by and transformation frequencies may be too low to be useful. Little is known about the T-DNA integration process, and no plant genes involved in integration have been identified prior to the present invention.",[Stanton B. Gelvin][Kirankumar S.

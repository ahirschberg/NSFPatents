08008018,20110830,Determination of fetal aneuploidies by massively parallel DNA sequencing,12393803,20090170113,20090702,"The present methods are exemplified by a process in which maternal blood containing fetal DNA is diluted to a nominal value of approximately 0.5 genome equivalent of DNA per reaction sample. Digital PCR is then be used to detect aneuploidy, such as the trisomy that causes Down Syndrome. Since aneuploidies do not present a mutational change in sequence, and are merely a change in the number of chromosomes, it has not been possible to detect them in a fetus without resorting to invasive techniques such as amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling. Digital amplification allows the detection of aneuploidy using massively parallel amplification and detection methods, examining, e.g., 10,000 genome equivalents.",[Stephen Quake][Hei-Mun Christina Fan],[The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University],"This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/764,420 filed on Feb. 2, 2006, and U.S. Utility patent application Ser.

The method comprises attaching a first end of a polymer to a first portion of the polypeptide, attaching a second end of the polymer to a second portion of the polypeptide, and altering the mechanical tension of the polymer, thereby altering the conformation of the polypeptide. The alteration of the conformation of the polypeptide may increase or decrease the binding affinity of the polypeptide for a substrate bound by the polypeptide, or alter the catalytic rate of an enzyme. Typically, the polymer is a polynucleotide or polypeptide.",[Giovanni Zocchi][Brian Choi],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/645,384, filed Jan. 20, 2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.",20060120,"This invention was made with Government support under Grant Nos. 0405632 and 1006162 awarded by the National Science Foundation, and under Grant Nos.

08008061,20110830,Trophic conversion of obligate phototrophic algae through metabolic engineering,11842898,20080138851,20080612,"Most microalgae are obligate photoautotrophs and their growth is strictly dependent on the generation of photosynthetically-derived energy. In this study it is shown that the microalga can be engineered to import glucose and grow in the dark through the introduction of genes encoding glucose transporters. Both the human and glucose transporters facilitated the uptake of glucose by , allowing the cells to metabolize exogenous organic carbon and thrive, independent of light. This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene. Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization. Finally, this work also represents critical progress toward large-scale commercial exploitation of obligate phototrophic algae through the use of microbial fermentation technology, eliminating significant limitations resulting from light-dependent growth.",[Kirk Emil Apt][F.

Silica/alumina nanolaminates were deposited on heated substrates by the reaction of an aluminum-containing compound with a silanol. The nanolaminates have very uniform thickness and excellent step coverage in holes with aspect ratios over 40:1. The films are transparent and good electrical insulators. This invention also relates to materials and processes for producing improved porous dielectric materials used in the insulation of electrical conductors in microelectronic devices, particularly through materials and processes for producing semi-porous dielectric materials wherein surface porosity is significantly reduced or removed while internal porosity is preserved to maintain a desired low-k value for the overall dielectric material.

A circuit architecture to implement echo and cancellers is also presented. The low complexity and low power design relies on the fact that a TH precoder can be viewed as an IIR filter with an input equal to the sum of the original input to the TH precoder and a compensation signal. The proposed design also relies on the fact that sum of the original input to the TH precoder and the compensation signal has finite levels, which can be represented in less bits than the original input of the echo and NEXT cancellers. An improved design by exploiting the statistics of the compensation signal is also proposed to further bring down the complexity and power consumption of these cancellers.",[Keshab K.

07201817,20070410,Magnetoelectric multilayer composites for field conversion,10940139,20050104474,20050519,"Magnetoelectric multilayer composites comprising alternate layers of a bimetal ferrite wherein one of the metals is zinc and a piezoelectric material for facilitating conversion of an electric field into a magnetic field or vice versa. The preferred composites include cobalt, nickel, or lithium zinc ferrite and PZT films which are arranged in a bilayer or in alternating layers, laminated, and sintered at high temperature. The composites are useful in sensors for detection of magnetic fields (); sensors for measuring rotation speed, linear speed, or acceleration; read-heads in storage devices by converting bits in magnetic storage devices to electrical signals; magnetoelectric media for storing information; and high frequency devices for electric field control of magnetic devices or magnetic field control of electric devices.",[Gopalan Srinivasan],[Oakland University],"This application is a Divisional of U.S. application Ser.

07202216,20070410,Drug therapy for celiac sprue,10514005,20050256054,20051117,Celiac Sprue and/or dermatitis herpetiformis are treated by interfering with HLA binding of immunogenic gluten peptides. The antigenicity of gluten oligopeptides and the ill effects caused by an immune response thereto are decreased by administration of an HLA-binding peptide inhibitor. Such inhibitors are analogs of immunogenic gluten peptides and (i) retain the to bind tightly to HLA molecules; (ii) retain the protcolytic stability of these peptides; but (iii) are unable to T cells.,[Ludvig M.

It achieves high throughput under nonuniform traffic. Its delay performance is not sensitive to traffic burstiness, switch size and packet length. Since cells belonging to the same packet are transferred to the output continuously, packet delay performance is improved and packet reassembly is simplified.",[Hung-Hsiang Jonathan Chao][Yihan Li][Shivendra S.

07203718,20070410,Apparatus and method for angle rotation,09698246,"","","An angle rotator uses a coarse stage rotation and a fine stage rotation to rotate an input complex signal in the complex plane according to an angle θ. The coarse stage rotation includes a memory device storing pre-computed cosine θand sine θvalues for fast retrieval, where θis a radian angle that corresponds to a most significant word (MSW) of the input angle θ. The fine stage rotation uses one or more error values that compensate for approximations and quantization errors associated with the coarse stage rotation. The rotator consolidates operations into a small number of reduced-size multipliers, enabling efficient multiplier implementations such as Booth encoding, yielding a smaller and faster overall circuit.","[Dengwei Fu][Arthur Torosyan][Alan N.

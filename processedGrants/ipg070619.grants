07232771,20070619,Method and apparatus for depositing charge and/or nanoparticles,10982179,20050123687,20050609,"A method and apparatus for use in depositing electrical charge and/or nanoparticles is provided. A stamping process is used in which a stamp having a flexible layer such as a flexible semiconductor layer applies a charge pattern on a substrate. Other techniques include lithographic patterning, the use of pre-patterned dissimilar materials, deposition by ions or radiation, the use of differing work functions, the use of liquid phase materials. Deposition monitoring techniques and apparatuses are also provided.",[Heiko O. Jacobs][Chad Barry],[Regents of the University of Minnesota],"The present application is based on and claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/517,327, filed Nov. 4, 2003, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",20041104,The United States government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to Agency Grant No. DMI-0217538 awarded by DMII Grant NSF.,"","","",""
07232989,20070619,Transverse optical accelerator and generalized optical vortices,11522665,20070084993,20070419,"A method and system for generating modulated optical vortices. Optical vortices can be used for a variety of applications, such as applying controlled torque or controlled force patterns to objects from a few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers in size. Numerous optical modes of optical vortices can be created to meet virtually any desired need in manipulating of objects. Furthermore, one can modify the wavefront of a beam of light in a specific way to create a new type of optical trap useful for manipulating mesoscopic materials. When the modified beam is brought to a focus, the resulting optical trap exerts forces transverse to the optical axis that can be used to transport mesoscopic matter such as nanoclusters, colloidal particles, and biological cells.",[David G. Grier][Jennifer E. Curtis],[University of Chicago],"This application is a continuation and claims priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/659,153 filed Sep. 10, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,109,473 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/451,886, filed Mar. 4, 2003, and 60/411,132, filed Sep. 16, 2002.",20060918,This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Contract No. UCHI-982/994 awarded by the National Science Foundation under Award No. DMR-9880595 and also National Science Foundation Grant under Award No. DMR-9730189.,10659153,11522665,"",""
07233423,20070619,Optical fractionation methods and apparatus,10845758,20050078343,20050414,"Static arrays of optical traps can be used to sort microscopic objects with exponential sensitivity to size. Such optical fractionation relies on competition between an externally applied force and the moving objects' differing affinities for optical gradient traps. In a reverse fractionation method, objects that are more strongly influenced by the traps tend to become kinetically locked in to the array and are systematically deflected back into an input flow. In a thermal ratcheting method, patterns are spaced to allow particle diffusion, thus providing the opportunity for forward or reverse movement through the patterns. Unlike other sorting techniques, optical fractionation can operate continuously and can be continuously optimized. The exponential sensitivity arises quite generally from the particle size dependence of the potential wells' apparent widths.",[David G. Grier],[University of Chicago],"",20040514,"This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Grants No. DMR-0304960 and DBI-0233971 awarded by the National Science Foundation, and through the MRSEC Program of the National Science Foundation under Award No. DMR-0213745. The U.S. Government also has certain rights to the invention pursuant to these contracts and awards.","","","",""

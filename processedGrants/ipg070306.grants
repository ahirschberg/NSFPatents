07187330,20070306,Differential and single ended elliptical antennas,11158905,20050280582,20051222,An antenna element includes a radiating antenna element having an elliptical shape disposed on a first surface of a substrate. A dielectric clearance region having an elliptical shape is disposed about the radiating antenna element to space the radiating antenna element from a ground plane. The clearance region is shaped such that a portion of the radiating element in which an antenna feed is disposed is proximate the ground plane. The antenna can also be provided having an elliptically shaped tuning region disposed within the radiating antenna element. The antenna is suitable for use in single-ended or differential ultra wide band (UWB) transmitting and/or receiving systems.,[Johnna Dawn Powell][Anantha Chandrakasan],[Massachusetts Institute of Technology],"This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119 of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/582,099, filed Jun. 22, 2004.",20050622,This invention was made with government support under Contract No. ANI-0335256 awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

07187441,20070306,Particle analysis system and method,09297895,"","","A system () and method are disclosed for the self-calibrating, on-line determination of size distribution f(x) and volume fraction φ of a number of particles (P) dispersed in a medium () by detecting one or more propagation characteristics of multiply scattered light from the particles (P). The multiply scattered light is re-emitted in response to exposure to a light source () configured to provide light at selected wavelengths. The determination includes calculating the isotropic scattering and absorption coefficients for the particles (P) by comparing the incident and detected light to determine a measurement corresponding to the propagation time through the scattering medium (), and iteratively estimating the size distribution f(x) and volume fraction φ as a function of the coefficients for each of the wavelengths. An estimation approach based on an expected form of the distribution and the mass of the particles is also disclosed. Furthermore, techniques to determine a particle structure factor indicative of particle-to-particle interactions which vary with particle concentration and influence light scattering at high concentrations is disclosed.",[Eva Sevick-Muraca][Joseph Pierce][Steven Richter][Rajesh Shinde][Ganesh Balgi][Jeffrey Kao][Huabei Jiang],[The Texas A&amp;M University System],"This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

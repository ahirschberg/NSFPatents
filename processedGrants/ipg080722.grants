07402319,20080722,Cell-free tissue replacement for tissue engineering,10672689,20050043819,20050224,"The present invention is a natural, cell-free tissue replacement that does not require difficult or extensive preparation made by washing tissue replacement in a solution including one or more sulfobetaines and an anionic surface-active detergent and washing the tissue replacement in serial solutions of the buffered salt to remove excess detergent. The natural, cell-free tissue replacement may be a nerve graft that supports axonal regeneration, guides the axons toward the distal nerve end and/or is immunologically tolerated. Other forms of the invention are a composition and kit prepared by the method of making a native, cell-free tissue replacement. The present invention may be modified for use in diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic applications.",[Christine Schmidt][Terry Hudson],"[Board of Regents, The University of Texas System]","This application claims priority to pending provisional patent application Ser.

07402884,20080722,Low crosstalk substrate for mixed-signal integrated circuits,11402209,20060255425,20061116,"An integrated circuit laminate with a metal substrate for use with high performance mixed signal integrated circuit applications. The metal substrate provides substantially improved crosstalk isolation, enhanced heat sinking and an easy access to a true low impedance ground. In one embodiment, the metal layer has regions with insulation filled channels or voids and a layer of insulator such as unoxidized porous silicon disposed between the metal substrate and a silicon integrated circuit layer. The laminate also has a plurality of metal walls or trenches mounted to the metal substrate and transacting the silicon and insulation layers thereby isolating noise sensitive elements from noise producing elements on the chip. In another embodiment, the laminate is mounted to a flexible base to limit the flexion of the chip.",[Ya-Hong Xie],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims priority from, and is a 35 U.S.C. &#xA7; 111(a) continuation of, co-pending PCT international application serial number PCT/US2004/041566, filed on Dec. 10, 2004, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, which designates the U.S., which claims priority from U.S. provisional application Ser.

07403008,20080722,Electron spin resonance microscope for imaging with micron resolution,11195388,20060022675,20060202,"ESR microscope systems and methods for examining specimens using both continuous wave and pulsed modes in the 9 to 60 GHz range. The ESR microscope uses an image probe comprising gradient coils in addition to conventional modulation coils (in continuous wave mode) or magnetic field bias coils (in pulse mode), and a resonator constructed from high permittivity material. The systems and methods also involves the use of sample containers that permit the precise placement of samples in relation to the image probe. The microscope uses a microstrip or thin coaxial or dielectric antenna to obtain a high coupling coefficient to the specimen being imaged. The microscope systems provide resolution at the single micron level, and permit the observation of images comprising tens to hundreds of pixels for each of two or three dimensions in a few minutes. Novel stable radicals used as the imaging media are also described.",[Aharon Blank][Curt R. Dunnam][Peter P. Borbat][Jack H.

07403509,20080722,Receiver for chip-interleaved block-spread multi-user communication systems,10841806,20050135314,20050623,"Techniques are described for performing block equalization on a received wireless communication signal formed according to interleaved chips generated from sub-blocks of symbols. For example, a one-step block equalization process is described which produces estimates of the information-bearing symbols from a wireless communication signal received from two or more transmitters in a soft handoff environment. The techniques provide improved performance in high load, soft handoff environments with low complexity, highly flexible equalization. The wireless communication signal may be a CIBS-CDMA signal in which a symbol block is divided into sub-blocks and spread by a user-specific block-spreading matrix. The CIBS signal is received through M subchannels and a de-spreading matrix is applied to produce a multi-user interference (MUI) free sub-block output for the mchannel. One-step block equalization comprises forming a single block from the m de-spread sub-blocks and performing block equalization on the single block.",[Georgios B.

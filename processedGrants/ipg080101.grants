07313948,20080101,Real time detection of loss of cantilever sensing loss,11419616,20060213261,20060928,"An approach to detect when a cantilever loses interaction with a sample, thereby detecting when a portion of an image obtained using a cantilever is spurious is presented. An observer based estimation of cantilever deflection is compared to the cantilever deflection and the resulting innovation is used to detect when the cantilever loses interaction. The loss of interaction is determined when the innovation is outside of and/or below a threshold level.",[Murti V.

A method for treating a fluid may include combining two or more separate streams into a common stream and then splitting the common stream into a new set of separate streams wherein the separate streams may possess different properties. The separate streams may be combined to produce a gradient, such as a concentration gradient or shear gradient. The apparatus of the invention may provide a network of fluidic channels that may be used to manipulate a fluid to produce, for example, a gradient or a series of solutions containing a substance at varying concentrations.",[Noo Li Jeon][Stephan K.

07314550,20080101,"Analytical separations with polyelectrolyte layers, molecular micelles, or zwitterionic polymers",10283471,20040084312,20040506,"Polymeric surfactants (molecular micelles) are disclosed for use in open tubular capillary electrochromatography or in high performance liquid chromatography. For example, fused silica capillaries are coated with thin films of charged polymers in a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM). A PEM coating may be formed in situ by alternate rinses with positive and negative polyelectrolytes. At least the innermost of the negatively charged polymer layers is a molecular micelle. Prototype embodiments have successfully separated seven benzodiazepines from one another. The run-to-run, day-to-day, week-to-week and capillary-to-capillary reproducibilities were very good, with relative standard deviation values less than 0.01. The PEM-coated capillary was very robust over at least 200 runs. Stability against high and low pH values was also observed. Using chiral polymerized micelles, chiral separations may be achieved, as was demonstrated with a separation of the enantiomers of 1,1′-binaphthyl-2,2′-dihydrogenphosphate. Alternatively, layers for use in this invention may be formed from zwitterionic polymers in lieu of separate cationic and anionic layers. Zwitterionic polymer layers may be used either with or without molecular micelles.",[Isiah M. Warner][Joseph B. Schlenoff][Constantina P.

The switching device comprises a first conducting region, a second conducting region, and a half-metal region interposed between the first conducting region and the second conducting region. The half-metal region comprises a material which, at the intrinsic Fermi level, has substantially zero available electronic states in a minority spin channel. Changing the voltage of the half-metal region with respect to the first conducting region moves its Fermi level with respect to the electron energy bands of the first conducting region, which changes the number of available electronic states in the majority spin channel, and in doing so, changes the majority-spin polarized current passing through the switching device.",[Ching Yao Fong][Meichun Qian][Lin H.

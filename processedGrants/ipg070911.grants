07267752,20070911,Rapid flow fractionation of particles combining liquid and particulate dielectrophoresis,11189123,20060108224,20060525,"Rapid, size-based, deposition of particles from liquid suspension is accomplished using a nonuniform electric field created by coplanar microelectrode strips patterned on an insulating substrate. The scheme uses the dielectrophoretic force both to distribute aqueous liquid containing particles and, simultaneously, to separate the particles. Size-based separation is found within nanoliter droplets formed along the structure after voltage removal. Bioparticles or macromolecules of similar size can also be separated based on subtle differences in dielectric property, by controlling the frequency of the AC current supplied to the electrodes.",[Michael R.

A change in the refractive index can indicate a change in the chemical composition of the fluid. The test volume has a depth comparable to or less than the wavelength of incident light. In one embodiment, an internal surface of the volume is coated with a binding partner selected to bind with a targeted molecule. When the targeted molecule binds to the binding partner, the optical properties of the system change.

07267859,20070911,Thick porous anodic alumina films and nanowire arrays grown on a solid substrate,10303653,"","","The presently disclosed invention provides for the fabrication of porous anodic alumina (PAA) films on a wide variety of substrates. The substrate comprises a wafer layer and may further include an adhesion layer deposited on the wafer layer. An anodic alumina template is formed on the substrate. When a rigid substrate such as Si is used, the resulting anodic alumina film is more tractable, easily grown on extensive areas in a uniform manner, and manipulated without danger of cracking. The substrate can be manipulated to obtain free-standing alumina templates of high optical quality and substantially flat surfaces PAA films can also be grown this way on patterned and non-planar surfaces. Furthermore, under certain conditions the resulting PAA is missing the barrier layer (partially or completely) and the bottom of the pores can be readily accessed electrically. The resultant film can be used as a template for forming an array of nanowires wherein the nanowires are deposited electrochemically into the pores of the template. By patterning the electrically conducting adhesion layer, pores in different areas of the template can be addressed independently, and can be filled electrochemically by different materials. Single-stage and multi-stage nanowire-based thermoelectric devices, consisting of both n-type and p-type nanowires, can be assembled on a silicon substrate by this method.",[Oded Rabin][Paul R.

Such a process overcomes the fundamental bandwidth-delay constraint in optics, and can generate arbitrarily small group velocities for light pulses with a given bandwidth, without the use of any coherent or resonant light-matter interactions. This is accomplished only by small refractive index modulations performed at moderate speeds and has applications ranging from quantum communications and computing to coherent all-optical memory devices. A complete time reversal and/or temporal/spectral compression and expansion operation on any electromagnetic field is accomplished using only small refractive index modulations and linear optical elements. This process does not require any nonlinear multi-photon processes such as four-wave mixing and thus can be implemented using on-chip tunable microcavity complexes in photonic crystals. The tuning process requires only small refractive index modulations, and moderate modulation speeds without requiring any high-speed electronic sampling.",[Mehmet Fatih Yanik][Shanhui Fan],[The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University],"",20041130,This invention was made with support from the United States Government under grant number NSF 0200445.

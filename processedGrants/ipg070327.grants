07194891,20070327,High-temperature gas sensors,10828096,20050229677,20051020,"A method of sensing the amount of a gas in a fluid flow includes operating an acoustic wave (AW) sensor at a first resonant frequency. The AW sensor includes a high temperature stable piezoelectric plate coupled to a first gas-absorbing layer. Also included is combining a fluid flow having a gas component with the first gas-absorbing layer at a temperature of at least about 500° C. At least one resonant frequency of the AW sensor is sensed. The amount of gas in the fluid flow is sensed by correlating the resonant frequency with the amount of gas absorbed in the first gas-absorbing layer.A sensor for sensing the amount of a gas in a fluid flow includes a first gas-absorbing layer, a high-temperature-stable piezoelectric plate coupled to the first gas-absorbing layer, and a controller coupled to the high-temperature-stable piezoelectric plate. The controller is coupled to the high-temperature stable piezoelectric plate to measure a resonant frequency in the high temperature stable piezoelectric plate correlated with an amount of gas absorbed by the first gas absorbing layer, whereby the amount of a gas in a fluid flow is sensed. The high-temperature-stable piezoelectric plate is formed of at least one material selected from the group consisting of AlN, GaN, AlGaN (0≦x≦1), GaPO, AlPO, and materials having the crystal structure of CaGaGeSiO, e.g., CaGaGeSiO, LaGaSiO, LaGaNbO, LaGaTaO, and the like.",[Harry L.

The specific targets were various molecular weight diblocks (PDMAEMA) and triblocks (PDMAEMA-b-PIB-b-PDMAEMA) with the PIB blocks in the DP=50–200(M=3,000–9,000 g/mol) range connected to blocks of PDMAEMA cations in the DP=5–20 range. The overall synthetic strategy for the preparation of these block cationomers comprised four steps: 1) Synthesis by living cationic polymerization of mono- and di-allyltelechelic polyisobutylenes, 2) End group transformation to obtain PIBs fitted with termini capable of mediating the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of DMAEMA, 3) ATRP of DMAEMA and 4) Quaternization of PDMAEMA to PDMAEMAI by CHI. Kinetic and model experiments provided guidance to develop convenient synthesis methods. The microarchitecture of PIB-PDMAEMA di- and triblock and the corresponding block cationomers were confirmed by H NMR and FTIR spectroscopy and solubility studies.",[Joseph P.

07196210,20070327,"Isoreticular metal-organic frameworks, process for forming the same, and systematic design of pore size and functionality therein, with application for gas storage",11119563,20050192175,20050901,"The ability to design and construct solid-state materials with pre-determined structures is a grand challenge in chemistry. An inventive strategy based on reticulating metal ions and organic carboxylate links into extended networks has been advanced to a point that has allowed the design of porous structures in which pore size and functionality can be varied systematically. MOF-5, a prototype of a new class of porous materials and one that is constructed from octahedral Zn—O—C clusters and benzene links, was used to demonstrate that its 3-D porous system can be functionalized with the organic groups, —Br, —NH2, —OCH, —OCH, —HC, and —HC, and its pore size expanded with the long molecular struts biphenyl, tetrahydropyrene, pyrene, and terphenyl. The ability to direct the formation of the octahedral clusters in the presence of a desired carboxylate link is an essential feature of this strategy, which resulted in the design of an isoreticular (having the same framework topology) series of sixteen well-defined materials whose crystals have open space representing up to 91.1% of the crystal volume, and homogeneous periodic pores that can be incrementally varied from 3.8 to 28.8 angstroms. Unlike the unpredictable nature of zeolite and other molecular sieve syntheses, the deliberate control exercised at the molecular level in the design of these crystals is expected to have tremendous implications on materials properties and future technologies. Indeed, data indicate that members of this series represent the first monocrystalline mesoporous organic/inorganic frameworks, and exhibit the highest capacity for methane storage (155 cm/cmat 36 atm) and the lowest densities (0.41 to 0.21 g/cm) attained to date for any crystalline material at room temperature.",[Omar M.

07708944,20100504,"Ultra-sensitive, portable capillary sensor",11451842,"","","A portable, lightweight, rugged, easy-to-operate biosensor useful for rapidly detecting cells, viruses, antibodies, and other proteins. A capillary tube has a capture antibody immobilized on its interior surface. The specific capture antibody is selected based upon a desired target analyte to be detected. A sample potentially containing the target antigen is introduced into the capillary tube. Thereafter, a second antibody labeled with a fluorescent dye is introduced. Upon excitation by electromagnetic energy, typically supplied by a laser, the fluorescence of the sample is captured and analyzed. The apparatus is extremely compact and rugged making it ideal for field use. In addition, accurate results may be obtained by relatively unskilled operators directly from a self-contained readout. Optionally, an external device (e.g., a computer) may be connected to the apparatus via an optional interface. The analysis time provided by the biosensor system of the invention is shorter than has heretofore been possible.",[Omowunmi A.

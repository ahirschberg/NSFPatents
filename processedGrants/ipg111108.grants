In accordance with one embodiment, a crystal growth architecture is separated by a permeable membrane from an adjacent well having a much larger volume. The well may be configured to contain a fluid having an identity and concentration similar to the solvent and crystallizing agent employed in crystal growth, with diffusion across the membrane stabilizing that process. Alternatively, the well may be configured to contain a fluid having an identity calculated to affect the crystallization process. In accordance with the still other embodiment, the well may be configured to contain a material such as a cryo-protectant, which is useful in protecting the crystalline material once formed.",[Carl L.

The catalytic material is made by depositing catalytic metals, such as gold or platinum, on substrate materials, such as lanthanum-doped ceria or other oxides. The catalytic metal, which comprises both crystalline and non-crystalline structures, is treated, for example with aqueous basic NaCN solution, to leach away at least some of the crystalline metallic component. The remaining noncrystalline metallic component associated with the substrate exhibits catalytic activity that is substantially similar to the catalyst as prepared. The use of the catalyst in an apparatus such as a reactor or analytic instrument is contemplated, as is the use of the catalyst in efficient, cost-effective reactions, such as removal of carbon monoxide from fuel gases, for example by performing the water gas shift reaction.",[Maria Flytzani-Stephanopoulus][Howard M.

Synthetic conditions, such as the ratio of oleylamine/tetraoctylammonium bromide as well as the doses of 1-dodecanethiol and 1,2-tetradecanediol have been optimized to ensure a formation of Pt—Cu nanocubes. Electrochemical evaluation shows that the catalytic activity of PtCunanocubes for methanol oxidation is superior, in comparison with those of spherical PtCunanocubes and Pt nanocubes with similar sizes, implying that the {100}-terminated PtCunanocubes offer a higher activity for methanol oxidation reaction than those with mixed crystallographic facets do. As another example, it was identified that PtCunanocubes is the best electrocatalyst on the basis of the maintainable electrocatalytic activity (which is even slightly superior to that of pure Pt nanocubes) and remarkable long-term stability (˜300 hours vs 3 hours for Pt nanocubes) when being performed towards formic acid oxidation reaction.",[Jiye Fang][Dan Xu],[The Research Foundation for the State University of New York],"",20101123,This invention was made with government support under DMR-0731382 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

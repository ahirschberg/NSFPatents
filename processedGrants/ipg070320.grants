07191643,20070320,Sensor system to distinguish frozen and non-frozen liquid particulates,11025214,20050268710,20051208,"A sensor system comprises a first sensor, a second sensor, and circuitry. The first sensor collects non-frozen liquid with a first collection efficiency, but does not collect frozen liquid. The second sensor collects non-frozen liquid with a second collection efficiency and also collects frozen liquid. The first collection efficiency and the second collection efficiency are substantially equivalent. The circuitry maintains the first sensor and the second sensor at a substantially constant temperature. The circuitry determines a measurement of the frozen liquid based on maintaining the first sensor and the second sensor at the substantially constant temperature. In some examples, multiple sensor systems can be used in combination to improve the accuracy of the measurement.",[Roy Martin Rasmussen][John Hallett],[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research][The Board of Regents of the University &amp; Community College Systems of Nevada on behalf of Desert Research Institute],"This patent application claims the benefit of provisional patent application 60/576,712; filed on Jun. 3, 2004; entitled &#x201C;Ice and Liquid Sensor System for an Airborne Vehicle&#x201D;; and which is hereby incorporated by reference into this patent application.",20041222,The Invention was made with Government support under Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) 63406630414 awarded by the National Science Foundation and under Agreement No. 98-C-00031 awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration.

The microvalve device further includes a thermal expansion actuator that drives movement of the valve face from a first position to a second position relative to the flow passage, and a capacitor that holds the valve face in the second position. The microvalve may also include an insulating layer disposed on portions of the semiconductor-based valve housing, and a capacitance sensor for monitoring a capacitance level to determine when the valve face reaches the second position. Once the sensor indicates that the second position has been reached, power is no longer applied to the thermal expansion actuator such that power is only substantially consumed during the transition from the first position to the second position.

Representative aging genes include, but are not limited to lin-4, lin-14, let-7, lin-28, egl-35 and lin-42. Methods for identifying modulators of aging genes and targets of aging genes are also provided. The disclosed compositions are useful as diagnostics. These can be used in assays to compare genes in normal individuals, with those who are aging well or who demonstrate early senescence, and with those who have age-related disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. The genes can be used to study the pathways and mechanisms involved in aging and age-related disorders. These genes can be used as drug targets, or in drug design, to develop drugs that can inhibit one or more characteristics of senescence or age-related disorders. These compositions should be effective therapies for treating or slowing the effects of one or more symptoms or characteristics of age-related disorders resulting from activation or over-expression of aging genes. Compositions that alter the expression of particular aging genes affecting the insulin-like signal pathway are described. Suitable compositions described herein include, inhibitory nucleic acids and small molecules, in particular miRNA.",[Frank J. Slack][Michelle M.

The shape is optimized using an implicit dimensional reduction rather than an explicit geometric replacement by discarding data of a 3D discretization that has little or no bearing on the performance of the component to a simulated event. The reduced dataset is then collapsed onto a lower dimension projection that is applied over a force vector that is representative of the simulated event to determine the behavior of the component to the simulated event. Optimization tools may then be used to modify the physical attributes of the component and performance of the component once again simulated until an optimized component is determined.,[Krishnan Suresh][Kavous Jorabchi][Josh Danczyk],[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation],"",20081212,"This invention was made with United States government support awarded by the following agencies: NSF 0726635, 0745398.

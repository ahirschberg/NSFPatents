07924057,20110412,Logic system for DPA resistance and/or side channel attack resistance,10586846,20080224727,20080918,"DPA-resistant logic circuits and routing are described. An architecture and methodology are suitable for integration in a common automated EDA design tool flow. The architecture and design methodology can be used in logic circuits, gate arrays, FPGAs, cryptographic processors, etc. In one embodiment, the implementation details of how to create a secure encryption module can be hidden from the designer. The designer is thus, able to write the code for the design of DPA-resistant logic circuits using the same design techniques used for conventional logic circuits. Contrary to other complicated DPA -blocking techniques, the designer does not need specialized knowledge and understanding of the methodology. In one embodiment, the automated design flow generates a secure design from a Verilog or VHDL netlist. The resulting encryption module has a relatively constant power consumption that does not depend on the input signals and is thus relatively independent of which logic operations are performed.",[Ingrid Verbauwhede][Kris J.

07925711,20110412,Centralized adaptive network memory engine,11957411,"","","There is a constant battle to break even between continuing improvements in DRAM capacities and the growing memory demands of large-memory high-performance applications. Performance of such applications degrades quickly once the system hits the physical memory limit and starts swapping to the local disk. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of Anemone—an Adaptive Network Memory Engine—that virtualizes the collective unused memory of multiple machines across a gigabit Ethernet LAN, without requiring any modifications to the either the large memory applications or the Linux kernel. We have implemented a working prototype of Anemone and evaluated it using real-world unmodified applications such as ray-tracing and large in-memory sorting. Our results with the Anemone prototype show that unmodified single-process applications execute 2 to 3 times faster and multiple concurrent processes execute 6 to 7.7 times faster, when compared to disk based paging. The Anemone prototype reduces page-fault latencies by a factor of 19.6—from an average of 9.8 ms with disk based paging to 500 μs with Anemone. Most importantly, Anemone provides a virtualized low-latency access to potentially “unlimited” network memory resources.",[Kartik Gopalan][Michael Hines][Jian Wang],[The Research Foundation of State University of New York],"The present application claims benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/870,320, filed Dec. 15, 2006, the entirety of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.",20071215,This invention was developed in part under National Science Foundation Grant No. 0509131.,"","","",""

08372046,20130212,Drug delivery device with in-plane bandpass regulation check valve in heat-shrink packaging,12709188,20100217209,20100826,A drug delivery device may include a drug reservoir configured to contain and controllably deliver a fluidic drug. A tube may be configured to deliver the fluid from the drug reservoir through a lumen in the tube to another location. A valve wholly within the lumen of the tube may regulate the flow of the fluid through the tube without substantially diverting the direction in which the fluid flows through the tube. The valve may contain only a single member which moves during operation of the valve. The valve may be configured to regulate the flow of fluid in a bandpass manner by allowing fluid to flow through the valve only when the pressure of the fluid is above a minimum and below a maximum. The valve may be held in place within the tube solely by frictional force between the valve and a wall of the tube.,[Ellis Meng][Ronalee Lo Mann],[University of Southern California],"This application is based upon and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/154,314, entitled &#x201C;I-PBRCVH-SPDD,&#x201D; filed Feb. 20, 2009, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/266,978, entitled &#x201C;EBFDD,&#x201D; filed Dec. 4, 2009, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/266,977, entitled &#x201C;R-DRURNA NDVMEMS-BP,&#x201D; filed Dec. 4, 2009.This application is also related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/154,327, entitled &#x201C;MEMS EBA,&#x201D; filed Feb. 20, 2009,and U.S. patent application Ser.

The oxygen sensitive luminescence of functionalized fullerenes is used for numerous applications including oxygen detection; irradiation induced healing of polymeric materials; and phosphors for optical location and display applications. The degradation of the functionalized fullerenes allows for the detection of oxygen by diminished luminescence when the fullerenes are exposed to an irradiation source, such as a laser beam, in the presence of oxygen. The luminescence from a portion of a surface of a material with functionalized fullerenes allows for the location of the surface containing a functionalized fullerene target in the absence of oxygen or to heat the object in the area irradiated that is exposed to oxygen. The localized heating can be used to repair defects to a material containing the functionalized fullerenes.

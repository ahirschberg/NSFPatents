In one aspect, the present invention provides systems and methods for preparing high flux, fouling resistant nanofiltration membranes whose pore size can be readily tuned. In some cases, microphase separation of a graft copolymer comprising a backbone comprising polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and hydrophilic side-chains is used. In some cases, nanochannels of tunable width are formed, which may give the membrane permselective properties and/or anti-fouling character. In some cases, a copolymer may be used as an additive in the immersion precipitation casting of ultrafiltration or microfiltration membranes. In certain instances, the additive can segregate to the membrane exterior and/or pore surfaces, e.g., due to favorable interactions between the hydrophilic side chains and the surrounding environment, which may create a surface that resists fouling, e.g., by biological molecules.",[Anne M.

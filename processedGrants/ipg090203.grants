07485282,20090203,Method for the preparation of metal oxides in nanometric particle form,11087841,20050272592,20051208,"A process is described for the synthesis of metal oxides in a nanometric particle form that cannot be easily obtained by conventional bulk synthesis techniques. The method makes use of Colloid Occluded Carbons (COC) and Colloid Imprinted Carbons (CIC) as reagents and as templating agents for the preparation of metal oxides in nanometric particle form. The nanometric particles are suitable useful in the field of chemical catalysis, particularly for petroleum refining when in porous form, and as sensors, optical wave guides, and coatings.",[Thomas J.

In its principle, the temporal order of base additions during the polymerization reaction is measured on a molecule of nucleic acid, i.e. the activity of a nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme on the template nucleic acid molecule to be sequenced is followed in real time. The sequence is deduced by identifying which base is being incorporated into the growing complementary strand of the target nucleic acid by the catalytic activity of the nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme at each step in the sequence of base additions. A polymerase on the target nucleic acid molecule complex is provided in a position suitable to move along the target nucleic acid molecule and extend the oligonucleotide primer at an active site. A plurality of labelled types of nucleotide analogs are provided proximate to the active site, with each distinguishable type of nucleotide analog being complementary to a different nucleotide in the target nucleic acid sequence. The growing nucleic acid strand is extended by using the polymerase to add a nucleotide analog to the nucleic acid strand at the active site, where the nucleotide analog being added is complementary to the nucleotide of the target nucleic acid at the active site. The nucleotide analog added to the oligonucleotide primer as a result of the polymerizing step is identified. The steps of providing labelled nucleotide analogs, polymerizing the growing nucleic acid strand, and identifying the added nucleotide analog are repeated so that the nucleic acid strand is further extended and the sequence of the target nucleic acid is determined.",[Jonas Korlach][Watt W.

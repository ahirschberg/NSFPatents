08017755,20110913,RNA-based transcriptional regulators,10852626,20050070016,20050331,RNA molecules have been shown to play a variety of functional roles in biological processes. RNA sequences can adopt 3-D conformations able to regulate transcription. RNA-based transcriptional regulators when recruited to a DNA template act to promote or suppress the transcription of nearby genes. The regulators are thought to act by mimicing the activation domains of protein transcriptional activators. These RNA-based transcriptional regulators may be engineered to regulate transcription based on the binding of a ligand such as a small molecule. RNA sequences of the regulators may be evolved to produce regulators with a greater degree of transcriptional activation or suppression. The RNA-based system of the present invention is useful in studying biological processes and in altering biological process in a therapeutic context.,[David R. Liu][Allen R. Buskirk][Polina D.

08018121,20110913,Integrated thickness shear mode (TSM) sensor and surface acoustic wave (SAW) device for simultaneous sensing and removal of analytes,12483456,"","","Provided is a sensor which integrates a pair of substantially unidirectional surface acoustic wave (SAW) interdigital transducers (IDTs) and a thickness shear mode (TSM) electrode. The sensor provides simultaneous sensing and removal of material from the sensor's surface. The sensing aspect is accomplished through the use of the TSM electrode that is designed to operate between 2 and 100 MHz. The removal of material is accomplished using substantially unidirectional IDTs aligned on the substrate to produce acoustic waves, such as Rayleigh waves, across the entire TSM sensor active area. When liquid is added over the acoustic waves, acoustic streaming occurs, which dislodges material from the sensor's surface. The acoustic waves are designed to operate at a significantly different frequency than the sensor to prevent interference between the two.",[Stefan Cular],[University of South Florida],"This application claims priority to co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/060,966, filed Jun. 12, 2008.",20090612,This invention was made with Government support under Contract Number W81XWH-05-1-0585 awarded by the United States Army and Grant Number DGE-0221681 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

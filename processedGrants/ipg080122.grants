07321854,20080122,Prosody based audio/visual co-analysis for co-verbal gesture recognition,10666460,20040056907,20040325,"The present method incorporates audio and visual cues from human gesticulation for automatic recognition. The methodology articulates a framework for co-analyzing gestures and prosodic elements of a person's speech. The methodology can be applied to a wide range of algorithms involving analysis of gesticulating individuals. The examples of interactive technology applications can range from information kiosks to personal computers. The video analysis of human activity provides a basis for the development of automated surveillance technologies in public places such as airports, shopping malls, and sporting events.",[Rajeev Sharma][Mohammed Yeasin][Sanshzar Kettebekov],[The Penn State Research Foundation],"This application is based on and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/413,998, filed Sep. 19, 2002, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.",20030919,"This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation pursuant to CAREER Grant IIS-97-33644 and Grant No. NSF IIS-0081935.

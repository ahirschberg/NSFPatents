07713352,20100511,Synthesis of fibers of inorganic materials using low-melting metals,11521084,20070095276,20070503,"A process is provided to produce bulk quantities of nanowires in a variety of semiconductor materials. Thin films and droplets of low-melting metals such as gallium, indium, bismuth, and aluminum are used to dissolve and to produce nanowires. The dissolution of solutes can be achieved by using a solid source of solute and low-melting metal, or using a vapor phase source of solute and low-melting metal. The resulting nanowires range in size from 1 nanometer up to 1 micron in diameter and lengths ranging from 1 nanometer to several hundred nanometers or microns. This process does not require the use of metals such as gold and iron in the form of clusters whose size determines the resulting nanowire size. In addition, the process allows for a lower growth temperature, better control over size and size distribution, and better control over the composition and purity of the nanowire produced therefrom.",[Mahendra Kumar Sunkara][Shashank Sharma][Hari Chandrasekaran][Hongwei Li][Sreeram Vaddiraju],"[University of Louisville Research Foundation, Inc.]","This application is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. application Ser.

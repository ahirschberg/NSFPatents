The composition is generally a solution comprised of a positively or negatively charged peptide-amphiphile and a like signed ion from the mineral. Mixing this solution with a second solution containing a dissolved counter-ion of the mineral and/or a second oppositely charged peptide amphiphile, results in the rapid self assembly of the peptide-amphiphiles into a nanofiber gel and templated mineralization of the ions. Templated mineralization of the initially dissolved mineral cations and anions in the mixture occurs with preferential orientation of the mineral crystals along the fiber surfaces within the nanofiber gel. One advantage of the present invention is that it results in homogenous growth of the mineral throughout the nanofiber gel. Another advantage of the present invention is that the nanofiber gel formation and mineralization reactions occur in a single mixing step and under substantially neutral or physiological pH conditions. These homogeneous nanostructured composite materials are useful for medical applications especially the regeneration of damaged bone in mammals. This invention is directed to the synthesis of peptide-amphiphiles with more than one amphiphilic moment and to supramolecular compositions comprised of such multi-dimensional peptide-amphiphiles.

The mechanical components are similar to a fingertip, with a rigid core surrounded by a weakly conductive fluid contained within an elastomeric skin. The deformable properties of the finger pad can be used as part of a transduction process. Multiple electrodes can be mounted on the surface of the rigid core and connected to impedance measuring circuitry within the core. External forces deform the fluid path around the electrodes, resulting in a distributed pattern of impedance changes containing information about those forces and the objects that applied them. Strategies are described for extracting features related to the mechanical inputs and using this information for reflexive grip control. Controlling grip force in a prosthetic having sensory feedback information is described. Pressure transducers can provide sensory feedback by measuring micro-vibrations due to sliding friction.","",[University of Southern California],"This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent application Ser.

This step is then repeated one or more times, but transmitting from a different transmitting element in each repetition of the step, until each element being calibrated has received at least one transmission. Then, the first distance is changed to a second distance, and the steps are repeated one or more times to gather additional measurements. These measurements allow the determination from the received signals of two separate element mutual coupling ratios, one ratio for one subset of the elements being calibrated and the other for a second subset comprising the remaining elements being calibrated. Next, at least four additional transmissions and receptions are made via two transmissions each from two transmitting elements comprising one element of each subset, and the reception of transmissions from each of these two transmitting elements by each of two receiving elements, the two receiving elements being different elements than the two transmitting elements. From these last measurements a complex calibration ratio for all of the elements being calibrated with respect to a single element is determined. For calibration in the transmit mode, this same procedure is followed, but the transmissions become receptions and the receptions become transmissions.","",[University of Massachusetts],"",20101215,This invention was made with government support under grant number EEC-0313747 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

The sensor may take on a complex patterned shape to enhance the sensitivity and flexibility of the sensor structure. When the sensor is interrogated with a time-varying magnetic field, the sensor will mechanically vibrate and generate a magnetic flux which is maximum at a resonant characteristic determined by the mass load on the sensor and the viscosity of the fluid surrounding the sensor. By correlating the measured resonant characteristic to the mass load and viscosity, the pathological state in and around the stent can be determined.","",[The Regents of The University of Michigan],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/057,778, filed May 30, 2008, the entirety of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.",20090601,This invention was made with government support under grants EEC0744962and EEC9986866 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

After the interface's shape and position are modeled by parameters, an explicit model of object points as measurement is established taking account of refraction happening at the interface. Efficiency and convergence are assured by using measurement of object points to acquire initial estimates for refraction angles at the interface. Then, an optimization method is performed to get the optimized value of interface parameters. Last, based on the resulting interface parameters, 3-dimensional positions of object points in all the subsequent measurement could be reconstructed accurately. Therefore, the distortion induced by refraction in the measurement is corrected. Numerical simulations of the proposed calibration process confirm that it is both robust and accurate for a range of experimental conditions, even in the presence of Gaussian noise in the measurement.","",[University of South Carolina],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/190,846 filed Sep. 3, 2008, entitled &#x201C;ROBUST STEREO CALIBRATION METHOD FOR ACCURATE DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION MEASUREMENTS&#x201D; and having the same inventors as present, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.",20090903,"Certain aspects of the presently disclosed technology were developed with funding from the National Science Foundation through grant CMS-0556362.

Then, the system acquires a person image associated with a behavior camera track, determines the pose of the person image based on its floor position, and corrects the pose of the person image. The system also acquires person images from face camera images associated with a face camera track, and combines the images with corrected person images from the previous step to form pairwise person images. The pairwise person image is fed to the trained pose-dependent pairwise person verification machines according to the pose of the person images, to compute the appearance match scores between the pair of person images. Finally, the combination of the appearance match scores and the spatiotemporal match scores of the pair of person images determines whether or not the person images belong to the same person.","",[VideoMining Corporation],"",20090421,The invention was made partially with U.S. Government support under Grant No. 0548734 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

Provided herein is an analysis of this problem to show that there is an optimal number of coded data packets, in terms of mean completion time, to be sent before stopping to listen. This number depends on the latency, probabilities of packet erasure and ACK erasure, and the number of degrees of freedom that the receiver requires to decode the data. This scheme is optimal in terms of the mean time to complete the transmission of a fixed number of data packets. It is shown that its performance is very close to that of a full-duplex system, while transmitting a different number of coded packets can cause large degradation in performance, especially if latency is high. Also described herein is the throughput performance of the novel system and technique along with a comparison to existing half-duplex Go-back-N and Selective Repeat ARQ schemes.

Performance of such applications degrades quickly once the system hits the physical memory limit and starts swapping to the local disk. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of Anemone—an Adaptive Network Memory Engine—that virtualizes the collective unused memory of multiple machines across a gigabit Ethernet LAN, without requiring any modifications to the either the large memory applications or the Linux kernel. We have implemented a working prototype of Anemone and evaluated it using real-world unmodified applications such as ray-tracing and large in-memory sorting. Our results with the Anemone prototype show that unmodified single-process applications execute 2 to 3 times faster and multiple concurrent processes execute 6 to 7.7 times faster, when compared to disk based paging. The Anemone prototype reduces page-fault latencies by a factor of 19.6—from an average of 9.8 ms with disk based paging to 500 μs with Anemone. Most importantly, Anemone provides a virtualized low-latency access to potentially “unlimited” network memory resources.","",[The Research Foundation of State University of New York],"The present application claims benefit of priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/957,411, filed Dec. 15, 2007, which claims benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/870,320, filed Dec. 15, 2006, the entirety of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.1 IntroductionRapid improvements in DRAM capacities have been unable to keep up with the unprecedented the growth in memory demands of applications, such as multimedia/graphics processing, high resolution volumetric rendering, weather prediction, large-scale simulations, and large databases. The issue is not whether one can provide enough DRAM to satisfy these modern memory-hungry applications; rather, provide more memory and they'll use it all up and ask for even more. Simply buying more memory to plug into a single machine is neither sustainable nor economical for most users because (1) the price per byte of DRAM within a single node increases non-linearly and rapidly, (2) memory bank limitations within commodity nodes prevent unrestricted scaling and (3) investment in specialized large memory hardware is prohibitively expensive and such technology quickly becomes obsolete.In this constant battle to break-even, it does not take very long for large memory applications to hit the physical memory limit and start swapping (or paging) to physical disk, which in turn throttles their performance. At the same time, it is often the case that while memory resources in one machine might be heavily loaded, large amounts of memory in other machines in a high-speed LAN might remain idle or under-utilized. In typical commodity clusters, one often sees a mixed batch of applications of which some have very high memory demands, while most have only low or moderate demands. Consequently, instead of paging directly to a slow local disk, one could significantly reduce access latencies by first paging over a high-speed LAN to the unused memory of remote machines and then turn to disk-based paging only as the last resort after exhausting the available remote memory. Remote memory access can be viewed as another level in the traditional memory hierarchy which fills the widening performance gap between very low latency access to main memory and high latency access to local disk.Recent years have also seen a phenomenal rise in affordable gigabit Ethernet LANs that provide low latency, support for jumbo frames (packet sizes greater than 1500 bytes), and offer attractive cost-to-performance ratios. An interesting question naturally follows from the above discussion: Can we transparently virtualize (or pool together) the collective unused memory of commodity nodes across a high-speed LAN and enable unmodified large memory applications to avoid the disk access bottleneck by using this collective memory resource? Prior efforts [6, 11, 10, 17, 19, 12, 20, 23] to address this problem have either relied upon expensive interconnect hardware (ATM/Myrinet/Infiniband) or used bandwidth limited 10/100 Mbps networks that are far too slow to provide meaningful application speedups. In addition, extensive changes were often required either to the large memory applications or the end-host operating system. Note that the above research question of transparent remote memory access is different from the research on Software Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) [9] systems that permits nodes in a network to behave as if they were shared memory multiprocessors, often requiring use of customized application programming interfaces.Experiences in the design, implementation and evaluation of the Adaptive Network Memory Engine (Anemone) system are described. Anemone virtualizes the collective unused memory resources across nodes in a commodity gigabit Ethernet LAN and allows unmodified memory-hungry applications to transparently benefit from low-overhead access to potentially &#x201C;unlimited&#x201D; remote memory resources. The Anemone system makes the following specific contributions. (1) Anemone presents a unified virtual interface for each memory client to access an aggregated pool of remote memory. (2) Any application can benefit from Anemone without requiring any code changes, recompilation, or relinking. Anemone system is implemented in pluggable kernel modules and does not require any changes to the core operating system. (3) Anemone is designed to automatically adapt as the applications' memory requirements change and/or the cluster-wide memory resource availability changes. It effectively isolates the clients from changes in the aggregate memory pool and isolates the memory contributors from changes in client memory requirements. (4) To the best of our knowledge, Anemone system is the first attempt at evaluating the feasibility of remote memory access over commodity gigabit Ethernet with jumbo frame support.Performance evaluations were conducted using two real world unmodified applications&#x2014;ray-tracing and large in memory sorting. Anemone reduces page-fault latencies by a factor of 19.6&#x2014;from an average of 9.8 ms with disk based paging to about 500 &#x3BC;s with Anemone. Anemone speeds up single-process large-memory applications by a factor of 2 to 3 and multiple concurrent large-memory applications by a factor of 6 to 7.7.It is therefore an object to provide a distributed remote memory access system, comprising: (a) at least one client, said client comprising: (1) a cache memory, and (2) a client remote memory access protocol layer, wherein when a memory page is evicted from said cache memory, it is communicated, under control of said client remote memory access protocol layer, destined to a cooperating server through a packet data network, and when said evicted memory page is required, a request is made under control of said client remote memory access protocol layer, destined to the cooperating server, to request and control retrieval of said evicted memory page.

In both instances, the [1,3]oxazine ring opens in response to the pH change forming an indolium cation, after the addition of acid, or a phenolate anion, after the addition of base. Alternatively, the switch may occur in response to a change in electrical current or potential or a change in temperature. Chromophores absorb in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Hence, their formation translates into the appearance of color. These processes are fully reversible and the original colorless state can be regenerated by switching the pH back to neutral. Thus, these halochromic compounds can be used to develop displays, filters, indicators, lenses, sensors, switches, or windows able to switch their color in response to pH changes.","",[The University of Miami],"This is a U.S national-stage application of Int'l Appln.

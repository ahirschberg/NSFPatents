08042209,20111025,Techniques for compensating movement of a treatment target in a patient,11911514,20080212737,20080904,"Techniques for improving treatment delivered to a target site in a patient include delivering a treatment from a treatment delivery device to a target site in a patient supported by a patient support structure. During the delivery of treatment, a state of the patient is measured to produce real-time measurement data. Measuring the state is non-invasive; and the measured state is a correlated surrogate for position of the target site. Compensating movement data is determined based on the real-time measurement data to cause the target site to maintain a particular spatial relationship with the treatment delivery device. Either the treatment delivery device, or the support structure, or both, are moved based on the compensating movement data. When the delivery device alone is moved, the correlation between measured state and target site is based on partial least squares applied to pre-treatment measurements of both.",[Warren D.

The inclusion of a small percentage of semiconductor material, such as 2% within the metal layer, reduces the temperatures required for crystallization of the amorphous semiconductor by at least 50° C. in comparison to the use of the metal layer without the small percentage of semiconductor material. During a low temperature isothermal annealing process adjacent Al-2% Si and a-Si films undergo a layer exchange resulting in formation of a continuous polycrystalline silicon film having good physical and electrical properties.

The algorithm progresses iteratively adding a new basis function at each step to refine the model. The placement of the basis functions is driven by a statistical hypothesis test that reveals geometric structure when it fails. At each step the added function is fit to data contained in a spatio-temporally defined local region to determine the parameters, in particular, the scale of the local model. The proposed method requires no ad hoc parameters. Thus, the number of basis functions required for an accurate fit is determined automatically by the algorithm. The approach may be applied to problems including modeling data on manifolds and the prediction of financial time-series. The algorithm is presented in the context of radial basis functions but in principle can be employed with other methods for function approximation such as multi-layer perceptrons.",[Michael J.

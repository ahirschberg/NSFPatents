The present invention provides a method for effectively making carbon alewives, which are discrete, acicular-shaped aggregates of aligned single-wall carbon nanotubes and resemble the Atlantic fish of the same name. Single-wall carbon nanotube alewives can be conveniently dispersed in materials such as polymers, ceramics, metals, metal oxides and liquids. The process for preparing the alewives comprises mixing single-wall carbon nanotubes with 100% sulfuric acid or a superacid, heating and stirring, and slowly introducing water into the single-wall carbon nanotube/acid mixture to form the alewives. The alewives can be recovered, washed and dried. The properties of the single-wall carbon nanotubes are retained in the alewives.",[Richard E. Smalley][Rajesh Kumar Saini][Ramesh Sivarajan][Robert H.

By being able to control the search space by limiting the number of generations, crossover rates, mutation rates, fitness evaluations, etc., the cognitive system can ensure legal and regulatory compliance as well as efficient searches. The versatility of the cognitive process can be applied to any adaptive radio.

07591897,20090922,Method for the rapid synthesis of large quantities of metal oxide nanowires at low temperatures,11385015,20070118938,20070524,A process for the rapid synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles at low temperatures and methods which facilitate the fabrication of long metal oxide nanowires. The method is based on treatment of metals with oxygen plasma. Using oxygen plasma at low temperatures allows for rapid growth unlike other synthesis methods where nanomaterials take a long time to grow. Density of neutral oxygen atoms in plasma is a controlling factor for the yield of nanowires. The oxygen atom density window differs for different materials. By selecting the optimal oxygen atom density for various materials the yield can be maximized for nanowire synthesis of the metal.,[Mahendra Kumar Sunkara][Sreeram Vaddiraju][Miran Mozetic][Uros Cvelbar],"[University of Louisville Research Foundation, Inc.]","This application claims priority from copending U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

In the presence of phospholipid, MSPs form nanoscopic phospholipid bilayer disks, with the MSP stabilizing the particle at the perimeter of the bilayer domain. The particle bilayer structure allows manipulation of incorporated proteins in solution or on solid supports, including for use with such surface-sensitive techniques as scanning probe microscopy or surface plasmon resonance. The nanoscale particles, which are robust in terms of integrity and maintenance of biological activity of incorporated proteins, facilitate pharmaceutical and biological research, structure/function correlations, structure determinations, bioseparations, and drug discovery.",[Stephen G.

The fusion proteins include a ligand-binding domain interposed between the splicing domains of an intein. An auxotroph-relieving protein domain is fused to one of the splicing domains so that the auxotroph-relieving function of the domain is activated upon ligand binding. The fusion proteins can be expressed in bacterial cells and used as sensors of binding of compounds with the ligand-binding domain of proteins such as the human estrogen receptors or the human thyroid hormone receptor. The bacterially expressed fusion proteins can detect and report agonist and antagonist activity characteristic of the naturally-occurring hormone with the ability to modulate the function of the protein from which the ligand-binding domain of the fusion protein is derived.,[David W.

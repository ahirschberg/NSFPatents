07849581,20101214,"Nanopore electrode, nanopore membrane, methods of preparation and surface modification, and use thereof",11744154,20080121534,20080529,"Provided are fabrication, characterization and application of a nanodisk electrode, a nanopore electrode and a nanopore membrane. These three nanostructures share common fabrication steps. In one embodiment, the fabrication of a disk electrode involves sealing a sharpened internal signal transduction element (“ISTE”) into a substrate, followed by polishing of the substrate until a nanometer-sized disk of the ISTE is exposed. The fabrication of a nanopore electrode is accomplished by etching the nanodisk electrode to create a pore in the substrate, with the remaining ISTE comprising the pore base. Complete removal of the ISTE yields a nanopore membrane, in which a conical shaped pore is embedded in a thin membrane of the substrate.",[Henry S. White][Bo Zhang][Ryan J. White][Eric N.

07851252,20101214,Materials and methods for creating imaging layers,12372185,20090206054,20090820,"The present invention provides patterned features of dimensions of less than 50 nm on a substrate. According to various embodiments, the features may be “Manhattan” style structures, have high aspect ratios, and/or have atomically smooth surfaces. The patterned features are made from polymer brushes grafted to a substrate. In some embodiments, the dimensions of the features may be determined by adjusting the grafting density and/or the molecular weight of the brushes. Once the brushes are patterned, the features can be shaped and reshaped with thermal or solvent treatments to achieve the desired profiles. The chemical nature of the polymer brush is thus independent of the patterning process, which allows for optimization of the polymer brush used for specific applications. Applications include masks for pattern transfer techniques such as reactive ion etching.",[Paul F. Nealey][Tushar S. Jain][Erik W.

07852829,20101214,Packet reassembly and deadlock avoidance for use in a packet switch,10872332,20050025141,20050203,"Practical packet reassembly in large, multi-plane, multi-stage switches is possible by using a scheduling technique called dynamic packet interleaving. With dynamic packet interleaving scheduling, if more than one packet is contending for the same output link in a switch module, an arbiter in the switch module gives priority to a partial packet (i.e., to a packet that has had at least one cell sent to the queue). The number of reassembly queues required to ensure reassembly is dramatically reduced (e.g., to the number of paths multiplied by the number of scheduling priorities). Deadlock may be avoided by guaranteeing (e.g., reserving) at least one cell space for all partial packets.",[Hung-Hsiang Jonathan Chao][Jinsoo Park],[Polytechnic University],"This application claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

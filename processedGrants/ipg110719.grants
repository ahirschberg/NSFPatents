07980953,20110719,Method for labeling images through a computer game,10875913,20050014118,20050120,"A methodology to determine the contents of an image uses an online game that is played by a large number of people at once. Each player may be randomly assigned a partner to form a pair. Partners do not know each other's identity and cannot communicate with one another. Players cannot see what their partners are typing, and the only thing the two partners have in common is an image that they can both see. One object of the game is to have each player type exactly what his or her partner is typing or has already typed. Once both players type the same string of words or letters, they receive a new image (the players are not required to type the string at the same time). The string upon which the two players agree is used as a label for that image. When trying to agree on a word, players may not be able to type certain specific strings of characters or “forbidden words”. When humans play the electronic game (online or over the Internet), they help computers determine the contents of images. If played by a large number of people, this game could provide a resource capable of classifying a vast portion of images on the World Wide Web. Because of the rules governing abstracts, this abstract should not be used to construe the claims.",[Luis von Ahn Arellano],[Carnegie Mellon University],"The disclosure in the present application claims priority benefits of the earlier filed U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

The apparatus uses collection surfaces designed to manipulate or change the electrostatic field so that the electrospun fibers are arranged in desirable patterns that are similar to or mimic the fibrillar structure of an animal tissue. The manipulation results in fibers that are preferentially oriented in a predefined pattern. In addition, the interfiber space between the fibers and the fiber diameter are consistently within a predefined range. Using these techniques in conjunction with controlling polymer properties enables the production of a scaffold that has the structural and mechanical characteristics similar to the native tissue.",[Stuart B.

08291034,20121016,Centralized adaptive network memory engine,13073459,"","","There is a constant battle to break even between continuing improvements in DRAM capacities and the growing memory demands of large-memory high-performance applications. Performance of such applications degrades quickly once the system hits the physical memory limit and starts swapping to the local disk. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of Anemoneâan Adaptive Network Memory Engineâthat virtualizes the collective unused memory of multiple machines across a gigabit Ethernet LAN, without requiring any modifications to the either the large memory applications or the Linux kernel. We have implemented a working prototype of Anemone and evaluated it using real-world unmodified applications such as ray-tracing and large in-memory sorting. Our results with the Anemone prototype show that unmodified single-process applications execute 2 to 3 times faster and multiple concurrent processes execute 6 to 7.7 times faster, when compared to disk based paging. The Anemone prototype reduces page-fault latencies by a factor of 19.6âfrom an average of 9.8 ms with disk based paging to 500 Î¼s with Anemone. Most importantly, Anemone provides a virtualized low-latency access to potentially âunlimitedâ network memory resources.","",[The Research Foundation of State University of New York],"The present application claims benefit of priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/957,411, filed Dec. 15, 2007, which claims benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/870,320, filed Dec. 15, 2006, the entirety of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.1 IntroductionRapid improvements in DRAM capacities have been unable to keep up with the unprecedented the growth in memory demands of applications, such as multimedia/graphics processing, high resolution volumetric rendering, weather prediction, large-scale simulations, and large databases. The issue is not whether one can provide enough DRAM to satisfy these modern memory-hungry applications; rather, provide more memory and they'll use it all up and ask for even more. Simply buying more memory to plug into a single machine is neither sustainable nor economical for most users because (1) the price per byte of DRAM within a single node increases non-linearly and rapidly, (2) memory bank limitations within commodity nodes prevent unrestricted scaling and (3) investment in specialized large memory hardware is prohibitively expensive and such technology quickly becomes obsolete.In this constant battle to break-even, it does not take very long for large memory applications to hit the physical memory limit and start swapping (or paging) to physical disk, which in turn throttles their performance. At the same time, it is often the case that while memory resources in one machine might be heavily loaded, large amounts of memory in other machines in a high-speed LAN might remain idle or under-utilized. In typical commodity clusters, one often sees a mixed batch of applications of which some have very high memory demands, while most have only low or moderate demands. Consequently, instead of paging directly to a slow local disk, one could significantly reduce access latencies by first paging over a high-speed LAN to the unused memory of remote machines and then turn to disk-based paging only as the last resort after exhausting the available remote memory. Remote memory access can be viewed as another level in the traditional memory hierarchy which fills the widening performance gap between very low latency access to main memory and high latency access to local disk.Recent years have also seen a phenomenal rise in affordable gigabit Ethernet LANs that provide low latency, support for jumbo frames (packet sizes greater than 1500 bytes), and offer attractive cost-to-performance ratios. An interesting question naturally follows from the above discussion: Can we transparently virtualize (or pool together) the collective unused memory of commodity nodes across a high-speed LAN and enable unmodified large memory applications to avoid the disk access bottleneck by using this collective memory resource? Prior efforts [6, 11, 10, 17, 19, 12, 20, 23] to address this problem have either relied upon expensive interconnect hardware (ATM/Myrinet/Infiniband) or used bandwidth limited 10/100 Mbps networks that are far too slow to provide meaningful application speedups. In addition, extensive changes were often required either to the large memory applications or the end-host operating system. Note that the above research question of transparent remote memory access is different from the research on Software Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) [9] systems that permits nodes in a network to behave as if they were shared memory multiprocessors, often requiring use of customized application programming interfaces.Experiences in the design, implementation and evaluation of the Adaptive Network Memory Engine (Anemone) system are described. Anemone virtualizes the collective unused memory resources across nodes in a commodity gigabit Ethernet LAN and allows unmodified memory-hungry applications to transparently benefit from low-overhead access to potentially &#x201C;unlimited&#x201D; remote memory resources. The Anemone system makes the following specific contributions. (1) Anemone presents a unified virtual interface for each memory client to access an aggregated pool of remote memory. (2) Any application can benefit from Anemone without requiring any code changes, recompilation, or relinking. Anemone system is implemented in pluggable kernel modules and does not require any changes to the core operating system. (3) Anemone is designed to automatically adapt as the applications' memory requirements change and/or the cluster-wide memory resource availability changes. It effectively isolates the clients from changes in the aggregate memory pool and isolates the memory contributors from changes in client memory requirements. (4) To the best of our knowledge, Anemone system is the first attempt at evaluating the feasibility of remote memory access over commodity gigabit Ethernet with jumbo frame support.Performance evaluations were conducted using two real world unmodified applications&#x2014;ray-tracing and large in memory sorting. Anemone reduces page-fault latencies by a factor of 19.6&#x2014;from an average of 9.8 ms with disk based paging to about 500 &#x3BC;s with Anemone. Anemone speeds up single-process large-memory applications by a factor of 2 to 3 and multiple concurrent large-memory applications by a factor of 6 to 7.7.It is therefore an object to provide a distributed remote memory access system, comprising: (a) at least one client, said client comprising: (1) a cache memory, and (2) a client remote memory access protocol layer, wherein when a memory page is evicted from said cache memory, it is communicated, under control of said client remote memory access protocol layer, destined to a cooperating server through a packet data network, and when said evicted memory page is required, a request is made under control of said client remote memory access protocol layer, destined to the cooperating server, to request and control retrieval of said evicted memory page.

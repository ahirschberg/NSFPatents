07559385,20090714,Ruggedized robotic vehicles,11073790,"","","A miniature, rugged robotic vehicle suitable for a variety of tasks including covert surveillance and reconnaissance. The vehicle may include a unitary single-piece chassis that provides structural rigidity to the vehicle and protection of onboard equipment. The vehicle may be configured to be thrown or dropped into an intended target site from a remote location. In one embodiment, the vehicle may include a wheel assembly having a tire with shock absorption capabilities in both radial and axial directions to cushion the vehicle from impact loads experienced during delivery. In some embodiments, the wheel assemblies may couple to a drive motor assembly of the vehicle via a clutch assembly that permits slippage between components to reduce potential damage to drive train components.",[Ian T.

Peptides, proteins, fusion proteins, protein complexes, and the like, are labeled with an acrylic moiety and attached to acrylic-functionalized glass surfaces through a copolymerization with acrylic monomer. The specific attachment of GST-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was more than 7-fold greater than the nonspecific attachment of non-acrylic labeled GST-GFP. Surface-attached GST-GFP (0.32 ng /mm) was detectable by direct measurement of GFP fluorescence and this lower detection limit was reduced to 0.080 ng/mmusing indirect antibody-based detection. The polyacrylamide-based surface attachment strategy was also used to measure the kinetics of substrate phosphorylation by the kinase c-Src. The surface attachment strategy is applicable to the proteomics field and addresses denaturation and dehydration problems associated with protein microarray development.",[Shawn B.

A MIMO-DFE based receiver architecture is developed to demonstrate the advantage over the traditional receiver design. A MIMO structure for systems with TH precoding is also developed for 10GBASE-T application. The proposed architecture overcomes the limitation of the traditional schemes and achieves a better SNR performance and lower receiver complexity. The proposed method relies on the fact that FEXT inherently contains information about the symbols transmitted from the three far end transmitters and it can be viewed as a signal rather than noise. Therefore, MIMO techniques are applied to turn FEXT into a benefit for the receiver design.",[Keshab K.

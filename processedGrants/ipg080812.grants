07409851,20080812,Detection of small bound mass,11093008,20060219010,20061005,"Prefabricated catalyzing adsorption sites are incorporated into small oscillators. In one embodiment, the sites are formed of precisely positioned gold anchors on surface micromachined oscillators. The micromachined oscillators may be formed of silicon, such as polysilicon, or silicon nitride in various embodiments. The sites allow special control of chemical surface functionality for the detection of analytes of interest. Thiolate molecules may be adsorbed from solution onto the gold anchors, creating a dense thiol monolayer with a tail end group pointing outwards from the surface of the gold anchor. This results in a thiolate self-assembled monolayer (SAM), creating a strong interaction between the functional group and the gold anchor.",[Bojan (Rob) Ilic][Harold G.

In some configurations, a bio-battery may also include a first cell containing the first electrode and the biomolecular energy source, and a second cell having a reducible substrate and the second electrode. The first cell can be in ionic communication with the second cell, for example by a proton exchange membrane. Various biomolecular energy sources can be used, including proton donor molecules or electrolytically oxidizable molecules. For example, the biomolecular energy source can be selected from the group consisting of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH), Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) and 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (FADH).",[Michael R.

07412107,20080812,System and method for robust multi-frame demosaicing and color super-resolution,11301811,20060290711,20061228,"An integrated method for both super-resolution and multi-frame demosaicing includes an image fusion followed by simultaneous deblurring and interpolation. For the case of color super-resolution, the first step involves application of recursive image fusion separately on the three different color layers. The second step is based on minimizing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) cost function. In one embodiment, the MAP cost function is composed of several terms: a data fidelity penalty term that penalizes dissimilarity between the raw data and the super-resolved estimate, a luminance penalty term that favors sharp edges in the luminance component of the image, a chrominance penalty term that favors low spatial frequency changes in the chrominance component of the image, and an orientation penalty term that favors similar edge orientations across the color channels. The method is also applicable to color super-resolution (without demosaicing), where the low-quality input images are already demosaiced. In addition, for translational motion, the method may be used in a very fast image fusion algorithm to facilitate the implementation of dynamic, multi-input/multi-output color super-resolution/demosaicing.",[Peyman Milanfar][Sina Farsiu][Michael Elad],"[The Regents of the University of California, Santa Cruz]","This application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/636891 filed Dec. 17, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference.",20051212,This invention was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number CCR-9984246.

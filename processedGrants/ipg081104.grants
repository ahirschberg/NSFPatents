07445671,20081104,Formation of metal oxide nanowire networks (nanowebs) of low-melting metals,10869489,20070209576,20070913,"A method of producing networks of low melting metal oxides such as crystalline gallium oxide comprised of one-dimensional nanostructures. Because of the unique arrangement of wires, these crystalline networks defined as “nanowebs”, “nanowire networks”, and/or “two-dimensional nanowires”. Nanowebs contain wire densities on the order of 10/cm. A possible mechanism for the fast self-assembly of crystalline metal oxide nanowires involves multiple nucleation and coalescence via oxidation-reduction reactions at the molecular level. The preferential growth of nanowires parallel to the substrate enables them to coalesce into regular polygonal networks. The individual segments of the polygonal network consist of both nanowires and nanotubules of β-gallium oxide. The synthesis of highly crystalline noncatalytic low melting metals such as β-gallium oxide tubes, nanowires, and nanopaintbrushes is accomplished using molten gallium and microwave plasma containing a mixture of monoatomic oxygen and hydrogen. Gallium oxide nanowires were 20-100 nm thick and tens to hundreds of microns long. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the nanowires to be highly crystalline and devoid of any structural defects. Results showed that multiple nucleation and growth of gallium oxide nanostructures can occur directly out of molten gallium exposed to appropriate composition of hydrogen and oxygen in the gas phase. The method of producing nanowebs is extendible to other low melting metals and their oxides such as for example: zinc oxide, tin oxide, aluminum oxide, bismuth oxide, and titanium dioxide.",[Mahendra Kumar Sunkara][Shashank Sharma][Burtron H.

A triangulated model of the closed surface is provided that includes a number of triangles. A number of random points within the closed surface are selected. A set of surface descriptors originated from each of the plurality of random points are generated, in parallel, using a ray bouncing algorithm. Each surface descriptor is determined using: a ray length of a ray traced by the ray bouncing algorithm; and an estimated property value at the point of intersection. The estimated property value is calculated using property values corresponding to the vertices of the intersected triangle. It is determined whether a distribution of the sets of surface descriptors converge using a convergence algorithm. The ray bouncing and convergence algorithms are repeated until this distribution is determined to converge.",[Curt Breneman],[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute],"This application is related to and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/506,661 entitled METHOD OF COMPUTING PROPERTY-ENCODED SURFACE TRANSLATOR DESCRIPTORS filed on Sep. 26, 2003, herein incorporated by reference.",20040924,"The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of Contract No.'s IIS-9979860, BES-0419413, BES-0214183, BES-0079436 awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Contract No. R01 GM047372-07 awarded by the National Institute of Health (NIH).","","","",""

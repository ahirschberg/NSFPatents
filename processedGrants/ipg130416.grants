08420033,20130416,Compositions and methods to sequester flue gas mercury in concrete,12305720,20100212550,20100826,Mercury adsorbed from combustion gas by activated carbon can be sequestered in concrete containing air entraining admixtures. The activated carbon may be made by providing a carbon char made from anthracite or low-volatile bituminous coal that was devolatilized and carbonized in an oxygen-depleted environment and activating this char in the presence of steam to provide an activated carbon with an acid blue 80 index of less than about 30 milligrams per gram of carbon. The activated carbon may also be made by providing a carbon char that was devolatilized and carbonized in an oxygen-depleted environment and activating this char in the presence of oxygen to provide an activated carbon. The carbon may be injected into a combustion gas stream containing fly ash and mercury and may then be removed with fly ash from the gas stream. The resulting composition may be used as a partial substitute for cement in air-entrained concretes.,[Yinzhi Zhang][Qunhui Zhou][Sidney G.

The method consists of generating a random population of polymerase mutants by mutating at least one amino acid residue of a thermostable polymerase and screening the population for one or more active polymerase mutants by genetic selection. For example, the invention provides a method for identifying a thermostable polymerase having altered fidelity by mutating at least one amino acid residue in an active site O-helix of a thermostable polymerase. The invention also provides thermostable polymerases and nucleic acids encoding thermostable polymerases having altered fidelity, for example, high fidelity polymerases and low fidelity polymerases. The invention additionally provides a method for identifying one or more mutations in a gene by amplifying the gene with a high fidelity polymerase. The invention further provides a method for accurately copying repetitive nucleotide sequences using a high fidelity polymerase mutant.

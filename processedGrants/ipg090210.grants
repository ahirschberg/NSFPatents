The GaN quantum dots obtained, which comprise isolated particles 2-3 nm in diameter with a relative broad size distribution (e.g., 20% standard deviation) exhibit strong exciton confinement.",[Paul Gregory Van Patten][Guiquan Pan],[Ohio University],"",20060503,The work described herein was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. (ECS-0210216).,"","","",""

The bifunctional viruses displayed an anti-streptavidin peptide and hexahistidine (SEQ ID NO: 4) peptide at opposite ends of the virus as pIII and pIX fusions. Stoichiometic addition of the streptavidin-NiNTA linker molecule led to the reversible formation of virus-based nanorings with circumferences corresponding to lengths of the packagable DNAs. These virus-based ring structures can be further engineered to nucleate inorganic materials and form metallic, magnetic, or semiconductor nanorings using trifunctionalized viruses.",[Angela M.

07489727,20090210,Method and device for online dynamic semantic video compression and video indexing,10987646,20050213656,20050929,"A technique for semantic video compression is shown in block (). Uncompressed video data (), including a plurality of video data segments (S, S, . . . Sn), are organized into two or more buffer slots (), such that each of the two or more buffer slots is filled with one or more of the received video data segments, thereby forming two or more buffered video portions corresponding to the two or more buffer slots. The buffered video data is then processed by a leaking rule, to extract one or more buffered video portions, while outputting one or more non-extracted buffered video portions, as compressed video data (). The leaking rule data is stored in a histogram () and later used to organize and index data according to a users request.",[Tiecheng Liu][John R.

07490218,20090210,Building a wavecache,11284760,20060179429,20060810,"A microarchitecture and instruction set that supports multiple, simultaneously executing threads. The approach is disclosed in regard to its applicability in connection with a recently developed microarchitecture called “WaveScalar.” WaveScalar is a compiler that breaks a control flow graph for a program into pieces called waves having instructions that are partially ordered (i.e., a wave contains no back-edges), and for which control enters at a single point. Certain aspects of the present approach are also generally applicable to executing multiple threads on a more conventional microarchitecture. In one aspect of this approach, instructions are provided that enable and disable wave-ordered memory. Additional memory access instructions bypass wave-ordered memory, exposing additional parallelism. Also, a lightweight, interthread synchronization is employed that models hardware queue locks. Finally, a simple fence instruction is used to allow applications to handle relaxed memory consistency.",[Susan Jane Eggers][Martha Allen Mercaldi][Kenneth Alan Michelson][Mark Henry Oskin][Andrew Kinoshita Petersen][Andrew Richard Putnam][Andrew Michalski Schwerin][Steven James Swanson],[University of Washington],"This application is a continuation-in-part of copending patent application Ser.

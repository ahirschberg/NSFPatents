The MEMS fabrication includes freestanding sample attachment points that are movable in a translation direction relative to one another when the substrate is moved and a sample is attached between the sample attachment points. An optical microscope images surfaces of the MEMS fabrication. Software conducts digital image correlation on obtained images to determine the movement of the surfaces at a resolution much greater than the hardware resolution of the optical microscope. A preferred method for measuring stress and strain in micro- and nano-fibers, tubes, and wires, and/or measuring the force required to pull-out individual micro- and nano-fibers, tubes, and wires from a polymer matrix and to therefore measure interfacial adhesion is also provided. In the method a sample is attached between freestanding platforms in a MEMS device. Relative translational movement between the platforms is created and motion of the platforms is imaged with an optical microscope.

Microfluidic systems can provide an advantageous environment for performing various reactions and analysis due to a reduction in sample and reagent quantities that are required, a reduction in the size of the operating system, and a decrease in reaction time compared to conventional systems. Unfortunately, the small size of microfluidic channels can sometimes result in difficulty in detecting a species without magnifying optics (such as a microscope or a photomultiplier). A series of tightly packed microchannels, i.e., a meandering region, or a wide channel having a dimension on the order of millimeters, can serve as a solution to this problem by creating a wide measurement area.

The apparatus, systems and methods employ nonbinary low density parity check (LDPC) codes that achieve excellent performance and match well with the underlying modulation. The nonbinary LDPC codes of the proposed apparatus, systems and methods are formed, at least in part, from a generator matrix that has a high density to reduce the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) with minimal overhead. The disclosed apparatus, systems and methods employ nonbinary regular LDPC cycle codes if the constellation is large and nonbinary irregular LDPC codes if the constellation is small or moderate. The nonbinary irregular and regular LDPC codes enable: i) parallel processing in linear-time encoding; ii) parallel processing in sequential belief propagation decoding; and iii) considerable resource reduction on the code storage for encoding and decoding.",[Shengli Zhou][Peter Willett][Jie Huang],[University of Connecticut],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional App. Ser.

RE041587,20100824,"Polythiophenes, block copolymers made therefrom, and methods of forming the same",11799760,"","","The present invention relates to polythiophenes, particularly regioregular head-to-tail poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (HT-PATs), block copolymers made therefrom, and their methods of formation. The present invention provides HT-PATs with well-defined, specific end-groups, functionalization of the defined HT-PATs, and incorporation of end group functionalized HT-PATs into block copolymers with structural polymers. The intrinsically conductive diblock and triblock copolymers, formed from the HT-PATs, have excellent conductivity and low polydispersities that are useful in a number of applications. The block copolymers of the present invention have been found to exhibit conductivities that range from a low of 10S/cm for certain applications to as high as several hundred S/cm or more.",[Richard D.

The measurement of spin parity allows for the determination of part of the states of the Fermions, which provides the states of the qubits, while keeping the undetermined part of the state coherent. The ability to know the parity of qubit states allows for logic operations to be performed on the qubits, i.e., allows for the formation of (two-qubit) quantum gates, which like classical logic gates, are the building blocks of a quantum computer.

The aspects of the invention are achieved by a liquid crystal device comprising an orthogonal nematic, smectic or columnar liquid crystal phase, which is uniaxial in absence of electric field, but becomes biaxial when electric field is applied normal to the director (in between electrodes for planar alignment, or in-plane electric field in case of homeotropic alignment). This electric field induced biaxiality (EFIB) mode is provided using any dielectric orthogonal nematic, smectic or columnar bent-core liquid crystal phase. The nature of the switching is dielectric (not piezoelectric) and does not involve variation of layer spacing variation, so as to be mechanically much more stable than prior systems. The high switching speed combined with a large change in the effective birefringence and constant optical axis of the liquid crystal materials provide useful features in various applications, such as liquid crystal television, beam steering, spatial light modulators, and a variety of other applications.",[Antal I.

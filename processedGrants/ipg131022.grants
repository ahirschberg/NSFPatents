The network configuration information input module inputs network configuration information. The domain knowledge input module inputs domain knowledge for the network. The network configuration information storage module stores network configuration information in a network database table. The domain knowledge storage module stores the domain knowledge in an exploit database table. The result generation module generates a result using the network database table and exploit database table. The result may be generated in response to a query to a database management system that has access to the network database table and exploit database table. The network may be reconfigured to decrease the likelihood of future attacks using the attack information learned from the result.",[Sushil Jajodia][Lingyu Wang][Anoop Singhal],"[George Mason Intellectual Properties, Inc.]","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/821,052, filed Aug. 1, 2006, entitled &#x201C;Interactive Analysis of Attack Graphs Using Relational Queries,&#x201D; which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",20070731,This invention was made with government support under: FA8750-05-C-0212 awarded by Air Force Research Laboratory/Rome; contracts nos.: DAAD19-03-1-0257 and W91 INF-05-1-0374FA8750-05-C-0212 awarded by Army Research Office; contract no.

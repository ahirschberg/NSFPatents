Some embodiments relate to methods for the production of specific aromatic products (e.g., benzene, toluene, naphthalene, xylene, etc.) via catalytic pyrolysis. Some such methods may involve the use of a composition comprising a mixture of a solid hydrocarbonaceous material and a heterogeneous pyrolytic catalyst component. In some embodiments, the mixture may be pyrolyzed at high temperatures (e.g., between 500° C. and 1000° C.). The pyrolysis may be conducted for an amount of time at least partially sufficient for production of discrete, identifiable biofuel compounds. Some embodiments involve heating the mixture of catalyst and hydrocarbonaceous material at high rates (e.g., from about 50° C. per second to about 1000° C. per second). The methods described herein may also involve the use of specialized catalysts. For example, in some cases, zeolite catalysts may be used; optionally, the catalysts used herein may have high silica to alumina molar ratios.

The setup assumes a packet erasure channel and that nodes cannot transmit and receive information simultaneously. The sender transmits coded data packets back-to-back before stopping to wait for the receiver to acknowledge (ACK) the number of degrees of freedom, if any, that are required to decode correctly the information. Provided herein is an analysis of this problem to show that there is an optimal number of coded data packets, in terms of mean completion time, to be sent before stopping to listen. This number depends on the latency, probabilities of packet erasure and ACK erasure, and the number of degrees of freedom that the receiver requires to decode the data. This scheme is optimal in terms of the mean time to complete the transmission of a fixed number of data packets. It is shown that its performance is very close to that of a full-duplex system, while transmitting a different number of coded packets can cause large degradation in performance, especially if latency is high. Also described herein is the throughput performance of the novel system and technique along with a comparison to existing half-duplex Go-back-N and Selective Repeat ARQ schemes.

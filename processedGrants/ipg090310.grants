In the method, a field containing the target is illuminated, and one or more spectral emission characteristics of the light-scattering particles in the field are detected. From this data, an image of positions and spectral characteristic values in the field is constructed, allowing PREs with a selected spectral signature to be discriminated from other light-scattering entities, to provide information about the field.

A beam of light is modulated, applied to the chiral mixture, and then split into a first beam and a related orthogonal beam by a polarizer or prism. The first beam and orthogonal beam are converted into electrical signals before a differential comparison of the signals is performed to detect a desired chiral species within the chiral mixture.",[Phillip R.

07502511,20090310,Shape grammar interpreter,11897180,20070297680,20071227,"Parametric shape recognition is achieved through a decomposition of shapes into a hierarchy of subshapes ordered by their decreasing restrictions. Instances of each of the subshapes are individually located in the design shape and then reconstructed to form an instance of the entire shape. The basis for the hierarchy of subshapes can be specified by the designer or based on the default parameter relations that come from architectural and engineering knowledge. The levels of the hierarchy are defined so that the most constrained lines of a shape are those lines that the designer intended exactly. These most constrained lines have specified parametric relations to other line segments and those relations, if altered, will compromise the designer's intentions. Conversely, the lowest level of the hierarchy, which contains the least constrained line segments, only implies a specific connectivity between line segments, necessitating a vaster search. The parametric recognition of curved line shapes uses a two-step approach that first performs shape matching with an equivalent straight-line shape then checks those transformations for matching with the actual curved lines. This approach has advantages over just matching characteristic polygons in that it can match equivalent curves with differing characteristic polygons as well as emergent shapes.",[Jay P.

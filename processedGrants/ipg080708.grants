07396685,20080708,Phase sensitively-detected reduced dimensionality nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for rapid chemical shift assignment and secondary structure determination of proteins,10628818,20040095140,20040520,"The present invention discloses eleven reduced dimensionality (RD) triple resonance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments for measuring chemical shift values of certain nuclei in a protein molecule, where the chemical shift values encoded in a peak pair of an NMR spectrum are detected in a phase sensitive manner. The RD 3D ,,(CO),N,HN NMR and RD 3D ,,(C-TOCSY-CO),N,HN NMR experiments are designed to yield “sequential” connectivities, while the RD 3D ,,CO,HA NMR and RD 3D ,,N,HN NMR experiments provide “intraresidue” connectivities. The RD 3D ,,C,H-COSY NMR, RD 3D ,,C,H-TOCSY NMR, and RD 2D ,,H-COSY NMR experiments allow one to obtain assignments for aliphatic and aromatic side chain chemical shifts, while the RD 2D ,,(CG,CD),HD NMR experiment provide information for the aromatic side chain chemical shifts. In addition, methods of conducting suites of RD triple resonance NMR experiments for high-throughput resonance assignment of proteins and determination of secondary structure elements are disclosed.",[Thomas A.

07396921,20080708,Compositions and kits for detecting a sequence mutation in cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase gene associated with altered lignification in loblolly pine,11155438,20050235384,20051020,"Loblolly pine (L.) is the most important commercial tree species in the USA harvested for pulp and solid wood products. Increasing the efficiency of chemical pulping may be achieved through the manipulation of genes involved in the lignin biosynthetic pathway. A null allele of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) has been discovered in the loblolly pine clone 7-56 which displays altered lignin composition. During identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cad gene, a two-base pair adenosine insertion located in exon five and unique to clone 7-56 was discovered. The sequence mutation causes a frame-shift predicted to result in premature termination of the protein. For routine detection of the mutation, a diagnostic assay was developed utilising Template-directed Dye-terminator Incorporation and Fluorescence Polarization detection (FP-TDI).",[Geoffrey P.

An allocator portion determines that the instruction, entering the pipeline, has one ready operand and one not-ready operand, and accordingly places it in a station having only one comparator. The one comparator then compares the not-ready operand with tags broadcasted on a result tag bus to determine when the not-ready operand becomes ready. Once ready, execution is requested to the corresponding functional unit.",[Daniel J. Ernst][Todd M.

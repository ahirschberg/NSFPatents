07906182,20110315,Method of thin film electrospray deposition,12353283,"","","A method of forming a smooth thin film on a substrate within a short deposition time, the method comprising introducing ionic substances (salts, acids, bases) to a polymeric solution to be sprayed. These ions attach to the polymer strands in solution, increasing their charge to mass ratio. This results in mutual repulsion of the strands during the spray process and produces a smooth film, even at relatively high polymeric solution concentrations. A side effect of this process is the introduction of impurities (the added ions) to the polymer thin film. The proper choice of ionic compound allows a dissolution step to be used to “clean” the polymer film after deposition, using the solubility characteristics of the thin film versus the ionic compound.",[Rudiger Schlaf],[University of South Florida],"This application claims priority to currently pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/021,743, filed Jan. 17, 2008.",20090114,"This invention was made with Government support under Grant NSF DMR 0510000, awarded by the National Science Foundation, Division of Materials Research.

07906962,20110315,Dynamic nuclear polarization enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance of water under ambient conditions,12229540,20090121712,20090514,"A method and apparatus are provided for treating hydrated material in a fluid that contains water in which a stable nitroxide is attached to the hydrated material. A dynamic nuclear polarization process (DNP) is conducted on the hydrated material whereby to hyperpolarize the water. A polarization cell contains the hydrated material to obtain hyperpolarized water free from the nitroxide. The dynamic nuclear polarization process is conducted using components comprising a tunable, solid state high power X-band driver and an X-band resonator for microwave transmission to the hydrated material. The components can also include a radio-frequency nuclear magnetic resonance probe, a permanent magnet formed to receive the hydrated material, a portable nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, and an electron spin resonance detector. The components can be sized to be portable, and include electrical input and output and a lap-size hard-case with access to the electrical input and output.",[Songi Han][Evan R. McCarney][Brandon D.

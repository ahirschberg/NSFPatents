08293061,20121023,Low temperature polymer bonding using UV/ozone surface treatment,12399178,20090227755,20090910,"The present invention relates to a method for bonding two surfaces to one another. The invention particularly pertains to the use of such method in which one of the surfaces is a polymeric plastic (and more preferably a polymeric thermoplastic (especially poly-(methyl methacrylate) (“PMMA”) or cyclic olefin copolymer (“COC”)). More particularly, the invention relates to treating at least one of the contacting surfaces with UV in the presence of oxygen to thereby generate ozone (O) and atomic oxygen under conditions of temperature below that of the glass transition temperature of the polymeric plastic. The UV/O-mediated bonding results in high bond strength and zero-deformation method. This bonding method can be applied to micro/nano-scale polymer devices, and particularly to microfluidic devices, for a low cost, high throughput, high yield advantage.","",[University of Maryland College Park],"This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Ser.

These three nanostructures share common fabrication steps. In one embodiment, the fabrication of a disk electrode involves sealing a sharpened internal signal transduction element (“ISTE”) into a substrate, followed by polishing of the substrate until a nanometer-sized disk of the ISTE is exposed. The fabrication of a nanopore electrode is accomplished by etching the nanodisk electrode to create a pore in the substrate, with the remaining ISTE comprising the pore base. Complete removal of the ISTE yields a nanopore membrane, in which a conical shaped pore is embedded in a thin membrane of the substrate.","",[University of Utah Research Foundation],"This application represents a divisional application of U.S. application Ser.

The resin materials can include a radiation-curable silsesquioxane resin and a photo-initiator having low viscosity. The low viscosity of the liquid system allows imprinting with low pressure and low temperature; e.g. room temperature. The resist's dry etching resistance is increased and the cured film is more easily separated from the mask. Due to its high modulus after cure, the material allows the fabrication of micro- and nano-features having high aspect ratios while providing a high throughput.

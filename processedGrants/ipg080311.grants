07340956,20080311,Built-in self test of MEMS,11370818,20060150709,20060713,"The present disclosure is directed to an apparatus and method for producing and comparing signals from various points in a MEMS device. By producing signals which should be of substantial identical characteristics, deviations from the situation where the signals are of identical characteristics can be used to identify various types of asymmetry which are otherwise difficult to detect. In one embodiment, the MEMS device is comprised of a plurality of fixed beams arranged symmetrically and a plurality of movable beams arranged symmetrically. A first sensor is formed by certain of the fixed and movable beams while a second sensor, electrically isolated from said first sensor, is formed by at least certain other of the fixed and movable beams. The first and second sensors are located within the MEMS device so as to produce signals of substantially identical characteristics. A circuit is responsive to the first and second sensors for comparing the signals produced by the first and second sensors. In addition to the apparatus, methods of performing a self test are also disclosed, which may be performed in real time.",[Nilmoni Deb][Ronald D.

The catalysts include a core material selected from amine coated polymeric beads, amine coated glass beads and multi-generational dendrimers to which condensed carbon molecules are bonded. These catalysts may in turn give rise to other solid phase heterogeneous catalysts useful for stereoselective or regioselective reactions, by way of non-limiting example.",[Anton W.

07342346,20080311,Microfabricated vertical comb actuator using plastic deformation,11381035,20060208608,20060921,A microfabricated actuator of the vertical comb-drive (AVC) type or staggered vertical comb-drive type for torsional or linear applications includes torsion springs which permit self-aligned deformation of the device (micromirror) structure of the actuator through the heating of the torsional springs to plasticity. The torsional springs can include perpendicular-beam springs or double folded beams which allow axial movement of the spring when heated. Heating of the springs can be by bulk heating of the actuator structure or by Joule heating to the torsional springs by passing an electrical current therethrough.,[Jongbaeg Kim][Liwei Lin],[The Regents of the University of California],"This patent application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser.

A channel-array structure can be employed to embody the heat sink. The EHD pumps are located at the inlet or outlet of the heat sink channels. Many advantages are achieved by the cooling system of the invention, including that the entire system can have similar or better performance than a conventional heat sink and fan system but with one-tenth the volume and weight and can operate silently.

A femtosecond driving pulse is focused into an HHG medium (such as a noble gas) to cause high-harmonic generation (HHG), for example in the X-ray region of the spectrum, via electrons separating from and recombining with gas atoms. A non-collinear pulse intersects the driving pulse within the gas, and modulates the field seen by the electrons while separated from their atoms.

Each phonetic feature of said hierarchy corresponds to a set of acoustic correlates and each broad manner feature of said broad manner feature sub-hierarchy is further associated with a corresponding set of acoustic landmarks. A pattern recognizer is trained from a knowledge base of phonetic features and corresponding acoustic correlates. Acoustic correlates are extracted from a speech signal and are presented to the pattern recognizer. Acoustic landmarks are identified and located from broad manner classes classified by the pattern recognizer. Fine phonetic features are determined by the pattern recognizer at and around the acoustic landmarks. The determination of fine phonetic features may be constrained by a pronunciation model. The most probable feature bundles corresponding to words and sentences are those that maximize the joint a posteriori probability of the fine phonetic features and corresponding acoustic landmarks. When the hierarchy is organized as a binary tree, binary classifiers such as Support Vector Machines can be used in the pattern classifier and the outputs thereof can be converted probability measures which, in turn may be used in the computation of the aforementioned joint probability of fine phonetic features and corresponding landmarks.",[Carol Espy-Wilson][Amit Juneja],[University of Maryland],"This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

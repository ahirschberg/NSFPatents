08215171,20120710,Uniform mass sensitivity thickness shear mode quartz resonator,12547976,"","","A ring electrode design that produces a uniform mass sensitivity distribution across a TSM device is presented. A new technique and apparatus to measure this mass sensitivity distribution is also presented. Novel electrode geometries on thickness shear mode (TSM) quartz resonators achieve radial uniformity of mass sensitivity, how receptive the device is to mass loadings, and high frequency stability across the active sensing area of the sensor device. The device allows for absolute mass measurement down to the nanogram level. Fabricated devices utilizing model predictions were tested using this apparatus, and good agreement between theory and experiment is found.","",[University of South Florida],"This application claims priority to currently U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/091,903, entitled &#x201C;Uniform Mass Sensitivity Thickness Shear Mode Quartz Resonator&#x201D;, filed on Aug. 26, 2008, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.",20090826,This invention was made with government support under grant numbers ECCS-0801929 and IIP-07122360 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

07431796,20081007,Method and apparatus for low energy electron enhanced etching of substrates in an AC or DC plasma environment,10784697,20040163763,20040826,"An apparatus for low-damage, anisotropic etching of substrates having the substrate mounted upon a mechanical support located within an ac or dc plasma reactor. The mechanical support is independent of the plasma reactor generating apparatus and capable of being electrically biased. The substrate is subjected to a plasma of low-energy electrons and a species reactive with the substrate. An additional structure capable of being electrically biased can be placed within the plasma to control further the extraction or retardation of particles from the plasma.",[Kevin P. Martin][Harry P.

07431929,20081007,Use of vaccinia virus deleted for the E3L gene as a vaccine vector,11022477,20060008470,20060112,"The present invention relates to vaccines having an increased level of safety comprising recombinant vaccinia viruses containing an inactivated E3L region. The invention also relates to methods for stimulating a protective immune response in an immunized host using the vaccines of the invention. The invention is based on the discovery that vaccinia virus mutants having deletions in the E3L region exhibit dramatically reduced pathogenesis while remaining highly immunogenic. In addition, the invention relates to modified recombinant vaccinia viruses engineered to express heterologous polypeptides and the use of such viruses in vaccines designed to stimulate a protective immune response against such polypeptides in a host. The invention further relates to an interferon-sensitive recombinant vaccinia virus with broad host range wherein a salamander eIF2Î± is inserted into the viral genome in place of at least a portion of the E3L gene.",[Bertram Jacobs][Sangeetha Vijaysri][James Jancovich][Latha Talasela],[Arizona Board of Regents],"This application claims priority to the following applications: International Patent Application No. PCT/US2003/021764 filed on Jul. 11, 2003 and published under International Publication No. WO 2003/009763 on Jan. 29, 2004, of which the instant application is a continuation application, and the provisional applications to which International Patent Application No. PCT/US2003/021764 also claims priority, namely, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/397,907 filed on Jul. 24, 2002 and U.S. Patent Provisional Application No. 60/399,815, filed on Jul. 31, 2002 each of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties herein.",20041222,"The subject matter of this application was supported at least in part by grant No. IBN 9977063GR from The National Science Foundation, so that the U.S. Government has certain rights herein.",PCT/US03/21764,11022477,"",""
07431969,20081007,Chemical vapor deposition of hydrogel films,11198932,20070032620,20070208,"In one embodiment of the invention, iCVD is used to form linear thin films using a radical initiator and an alkene. In another embodiment, iCVD is used to form crosslinked thin films by the addition of a crosslinking agent (e.g., a diacrylate or a dimethyacrylate). The incorporation of a crosslinking agent into the thin films is shown to increase systematically with its partial pressure. In one embodiment, when the crosslinker is EDGA and the monomer is HEMA it results in crosslinked P(HEMA-co-EGDA) copolymer. In another embodiment, when the crosslinker is EDGA and the monomer is VP, it results in crosslinked P(VP-co-EGDA). Disclosed are the effects of crosslinker incorporation on the thermal and the wetting properties of the polymers. The unique swelling properties of these films are also described; certain films of the present invention are hydrogels when soaked in water.",[Karen K.

07673521,20100309,Embedded nanotube array sensor and method of making a nanotube polymer composite,10537944,20070138010,20070621,"A method of producing polymer/nanotube composites where the density and position of the nanotubes () within the composite ca be controlled. Carbon nanotubes () are grown from organometallic micropatterns. These periodic nanotube arrays are then incorporated into a polymer matrix () by deposing a curable polymer film on the as-grown tubes. This controlled method of producing free-standing nanotube/polymer composite films may be used to form nanosensor () which provide information regarding a physical condition of a material (), such as an airplane chassis or wing, in contact with the nanosensor ().",[Pulickel Ajayan][Emer Lahiff][Paul Stryjek][Chang Y.

07674881,20100309,Convergent synthesis of proteins by kinetically controlled ligation,11545923,20070082378,20070412,"The present invention concerns methods and compositions for synthesizing a polypeptide using kinetically controlled reactions involving fragments of the polypeptide for a fully convergent process. In more specific embodiments, a ligation involves reacting a first peptide having a protected cysteyl group at its N-terminal and a phenylthioester at its C-terminal with a second peptide having a cysteine residue at its N-termini and a thioester at its C-termini to form a ligation product. Subsequent reactions may involve deprotecting the cysteyl group of the resulting ligation product and/or converting the thioester into a thiophenylester.",[Stephen Kent][Brad Pentelute][Duhee Bang][Erik Johnson][Thomas Durek],[The University of Chicago],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

In the process, at least one biocompatible polymer, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (a well-documented biocompatible material), was blended with the silk protein prior to processing e.g., electrospinning. We discovered that this step avoids problems associated with conformational transitions of fibroin during solubilization and reprocessing from aqueous solution which lead to embrittled materials. Moreover, the process avoids the use of organic solvents that can pose problems when the processed biomaterials are exposed to cells in vitro or in vivo.",[David L.

The space-time codes achieve the rate-diversity tradeoffâ€”i.e., they allow the transmission of information at the maximum rate possible for the given signaling constellation and the achieved transmit diversity level. New codes created by applying a nonsingular linear or affine transformation to the constellation labels retain the optimality of the original codes with respect to the rate-diversity tradeoff. Extensions to p-PSK, p-PAM, p-QAM, and related constellations, for p prime, are also given.","[Arthur R.

07676351,20100309,Statistical analysis of coupled circuit-electromagnetic systems,11778568,20080015829,20080117,"A method and system for combining the process variations in circuits and distributed interconnect-based electromagnetic (EM) objects in order to capture a statistical behavior of overall circuit performance parameters. In an exemplary approach, a coupled circuit-EM system is decoupled at the points where the EM objects connect to the circuit portion, and circuit ports are defined at those points. The sources of variation are identified and used to determine Y-parameters for the ports with EM elements and for all EM elements based on the SPICE-like and EM full-wave simulations. A response surface is generated for each variable and is used to extract circuit and EM parameters by generating many random vectors representing combinations of the random variables. These Y-parameters are merged to produce a probability density function (PDF) of one or more performance metrics for the electronic device or system.",[Vikram Jandhyala][Arun V.

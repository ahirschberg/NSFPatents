Chemical analysis of the plugs remains a challenge. It has been discovered that nanoliter plugs of sample separated by air or oil can be analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry when pumped directly into a fused silica nanospray emitter nozzle. Using leu-enkephalin in methanol and 1% acetic acid in water (50:50 v:v) as a model sample, we found carry-over between plugs was &lt;0.1% and relative standard deviation of signal for a series of plugs was 3%. Detection limits were 1 nM. Sample analysis rates of 0.8 Hz were achieved by pumping 13 nL samples separated by 3 mm long air gaps in a 75 μm inner diameter tube. Analysis rates were limited by the scan time of the ion trap mass spectrometer.

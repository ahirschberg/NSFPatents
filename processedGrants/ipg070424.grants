07208437,20070424,Catalyst and method for its manufacture,11035172,20050221975,20051006,"A catalyst is synthesized by a method in which a catalytic metal such as platinum or another noble metal is dispersed onto a support member. A transition metal macrocycle is also adsorbed onto the support, and the support is heat treated so as to at least partially pyrolyze the macrocycle and anchor the transition metal to the support. The catalytic metal is alloyed with the transition metal either during the pyrolysis step, or in a separate step. The catalyst has significant utility in a variety of applications including use as an oxygen reduction catalyst in fuel cells.",[Devon Renock][Intae Bae][Pu Zhang][Timothy K.

07208898,20070424,Near time-optimal jerk trajectory for positioning a control object,11158438,20060290314,20061228,"Method and apparatus for control object manipulation from an initial position to a final position. A jerk control profile describes a near time-optimal jerk trajectory for the control object and includes a sequence of first, second and third sinusoidal pulses of respectively alternating polarity and common absolute magnitude. The area of the second pulse is nominally equal to the combined area of the first and third pulses, and the pulses are preferably symmetric about the respective maximum pulse values. Associated control profiles (control voltage, current, velocity, displacement, etc.) are derived from the jerk control profile. For longer seeks, constant, non-zero jerk segments are inserted into the profile between the pulses, during which control voltage is maintained near saturation. The control object preferably comprises a transducer in a data storage device and the jerk control profile is stored in a memory location of the device.","[Chad Andrew Stoecker][Eduardo Akira Misawa][Clyde Everett Goodner, III]",[The Board of Regents for Oklahoma State University],"",20050622,This invention was made with government support under Grant No. CMS-9978748 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

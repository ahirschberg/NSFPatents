These tags or cards will only engage in wireless communications when they internally detect “secret handshakes.” A secret handshake recognition system is implemented on a passive WISP RFID tag having a built-in accelerometer. This approach is backward compatible with existing deployments of RFID tag and contactless card readers and is also designed to minimize the changes to the existing usage model of certain classes of RFID and contactless cards, such as access cards that are kept in a wallet or purse, by enabling execution of secret handshakes without removing the card. This novel approach can also improve the security and privacy properties in other uses of RFID tags, e.g., contactless payment cards.",[Tadayoshi Kohno][Alexei Czeskis][Karl Koscher][Joshua R Smith],[University of Washington through its Center for Commercialization],"This application claims priority to and the benefit of co-pending U.S. provisional patent application Ser.

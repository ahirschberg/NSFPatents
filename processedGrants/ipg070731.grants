07250139,20070731,Nanotipped device and method,10801928,20070151989,20070705,"A dispensing device has a cantilever comprising a plurality of thin films arranged relative to one another to define a microchannel in the cantilever and to define at least portions of a dispensing microtip proximate an end of the cantilever and communicated to the microchannel to receive material therefrom. The microchannel is communicated to a reservoir that supplies material to the microchannel. One or more reservoir-fed cantilevers may be formed on a semiconductor chip substrate. A sealing layer preferably is disposed on one of the first and second thin films and overlies outermost edges of the first and second thin films to seal the outermost edges against material leakage. Each cantilever includes an actuator, such as for example a piezoelectric actuator, to impart bending motion thereto. The microtip includes a pointed pyramidal or conical shaped microtip body and an annular shell spaced about the pointed microtip body to define a material-dispensing annulus thereabout. The working microtip may be used to dispense material onto a substrate, to probe a surface in scanning probe microscopy, to apply an electrical stimulus or record an electrical response on a surface in the presence of a local environment created around the tip by the material dispensed from the tip or to achieve other functions.",[Horacio D.

07250147,20070731,Process for derivatizing carbon nanotubes with diazonium species,10470517,20040071624,20040415,"The invention incorporates new processes for the chemical modification of carbon nanotubes. Such processes involve the derivatization of multi- and single-wall carbon nanotubes, including small diameter (ca. 0.7 nm) single-wall carbon nanotubes, with diazonium species. The method allows the chemical attachment of a variety of organic compounds to the side and ends of carbon nanotubes. These chemically modified nanotubes have applications in polymer composite materials, molecular electronic applications and sensor devices. The methods of derivatization include electrochemical induced reactions thermally induced reactions (via in-situ generation of diazonium compounds or pre-formed diazonium compounds), and photochemically induced reactions. The derivatization causes significant changes in the spectroscopic properties of the nanotubes. The estimated degree of functionality is ca. 1 out of every 20 to 30 carbons in a nanotube bearing a functionality moiety. Such electrochemical reduction processes can be adapted to apply site-selective chemical functionalization of nanotubes. Moreover, when modified with suitable chemical groups, the derivatized nanotubes are chemically compatible with a polymer matrix, allowing transfer of the properties of the nanotubes (such as, mechanical strength or electrical conductivity) to the properties of the composite material as a whole. Furthermore, when modified with suitable chemical groups, the groups can be polymerized to form a polymer that includes carbon nanotubes ",[James M. Tour][Jeffrey L.

The FLD structural genes confer resistance to formaldehyde and are therefore useful as a selectable marker in methylotrophic yeasts. The FLD promoter sequences are strongly and independently induced by either methanol as sole carbon source (with ammonium sulfate as nitrogen source) or methylamine as sole nitrogen source (with glucose as carbon source). Induction under either methanol, methylamine or both provides levels of heterologous gene expression comparable to those obtained with the commonly used alcohol oxidase I gene promoter (P). The FLD promoter of (P) is an attractive alternative to Pfor expression of foreign genes in , allowing regulation by carbon (methanol) or nitrogen (methylamine) source within the same expression strain.

Quasi-particle interferometry is a tool for constructing topologically protected gates. Assuming the corrections of the Moore-Read Model for v= 5/2's FQHE (Nucl. Phys. B 360, 362 (1991)) we show how to manipulate the collective state of two e/4-charge anti-dots in order to switch said collective state from one carrying trivial SU(2) charge, |1&gt;, to one carrying a fermionic SU(2) charge |ε&gt;. This is a NOT gate on the {|1&gt;, |ε&gt;} qubit and is effected by braiding of an electrically charged quasi particle σ which carries an additional SU(2)-charge. Read-out is accomplished by σ-particle interferometry.",[Michael H. Freedman][Chetan V.

07250729,20070731,Method of spark-processing silicon and resulting materials,11182372,20060284534,20061221,"The subject invention pertains to a method of spark processing silicon and resulting materials. The subject invention also relates to electroluminescent devices incorporating the materials produced by the subject method. The subject method for spark-processing can enhance the EL output, as compared with conventional spark-processed (sp) silicon. The enhancement of EL output can be due, at least in part, to increasing the light emitting area. The subject method can smooth the sp surface, so as to allow more complete coverage of the sp area with a continuous, semitransparent, conducting film. The smoothening of the sp surface can be accomplished by, for example, introducing into the spark plasma a volatile liquid, such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, in which particles can be suspended and/or in which a heavy ion salt is dissolved. The particles preferably float in the volatile liquid, rather than settle quickly. In a specific embodiment, silicon particles in the range of about 0.2 μm to about 20 μm in size can be suspended in the volatile liquid, such as methanol. The volatile liquid/silicon-particle suspension or volatile liquid/heavy ion salt solution, can then be inserted into a means for applying the mixture to the surface of a silicon wafer during spark-processing.",[Nigel D.

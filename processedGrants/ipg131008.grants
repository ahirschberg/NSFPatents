08549915,20131008,Micromachined gyroscopes with 2-DOF sense modes allowing interchangeable robust and precision operation,12605178,20110094302,20110428,"A z-axis gyroscope design is presented with a 2-degree of freedom (DOF) sense mode allowing interchangeable operation in either precision (mode-matched) or robust (wide-bandwidth) modes. This is accomplished using a complete 2-DOF coupled system which allows for the specification of the sense mode resonant frequencies and coupling independent of frequency. By decoupling the frame connecting the sense system to a central anchor, x-y symmetry is preserved while enabling a fully coupled 2-DOF sense mode providing control over both the bandwidth and the amount of coupling independent of operational frequency. The robust mode corresponds to operation between the 2-DOF sense mode resonant frequencies providing a response gain and bandwidth controlled by frequency spacing. Precision mode of operation, however, relies on mode-matching the drive to the second, anti-phase sense mode resonant frequency which can be designed to provide a gain advantage over a similar 1-DOF system.",[Adam Schofield][Alexander Trusov][Andrei Shkel],[The Regents of the University of California],"",20091023,"This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. 0409923, awarded by the National Science Foundation.

Preferably, the spheres or cylinders are assembled inside one of a hollow waveguide, a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber, a capillary tube, and integrated in a multimode fiber. Alternatively, the spheres or cylinders are assembled on a substrate. Optionally, the optical microprobe device also includes one or more of a waveguide, an optical fiber, a lens, and an optical structure disposed between the radiation source and the spheres or cylinders. Optionally, the spheres or cylinders are made from optically nonlinear or active materials that permit efficient nonlinear frequency generation and low-threshold lasing using the optical microprobe device.",[Vasily N.

08554490,20131008,Automatic vascular model generation based on fluid-structure interactions (FSI),13201946,20110295579,20111201,"A computer system and method are disclosed for automatically generating a vascular model of a blood vessel to support, for example, identification of mechanical factors corresponding to the blood vessel. The method includes interpolating data points corresponding to a contour of the blood vessel; generating a structural model representing three-dimensional structural characteristics of the blood vessel based on interpolated contours; generating a fluid model representing three-dimensional characteristics of fluid flow within the vessel; and generating a vascular model based on the structural model and the fluid model. The method may also include performing a mechanical analysis of the vascular model to identify a mechanical factor associated with the vessel, for example, a factor associated with a potential plaque rupture within the vessel. Embodiments of the invention are applicable to the diagnosis, assessment, or treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",[Dalin Tang][Zhongzhao Teng],[Worcester Polytechnic Institute],"This application is the U.S. National Stage of International Application No. PCT/US2010/024527, filed Feb. 18, 2010, which designates the U.S., published in English, and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/208,501, filed Feb. 25, 2009.

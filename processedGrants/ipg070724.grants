More particularly, the method includes moving a tip of a probe coupled to a cantilever in a vicinity of a feature of a sample, which emits one or more photons at a detected rate relative to a background rate of the sample based upon the presence of the tip of the probe in the vicinity of the feature. The method modifies the detected rate of the feature of the sample, whereupon the modifying of the detected rate causes the feature of the sample to enhance relative to background rate of the feature.",[Stephen R.

A probe having a probe electrode and a substrate having a counter electrode are provided. Voltage applied to the probe electrode and/or counter electrode provides electrostatic attraction between them, moving a probe tip into sufficient proximity to the substrate to apply the patterning compound. Alternatively, a flexible cantilevered probe anchored to a holder includes a layer of conductive material forming a probe electrode. A counter electrode on the holder faces the probe electrode. The holder and probe are positioned so that a probe tip applies the compound to the substrate. The probe is disposed between the substrate and the counter electrode. An electrostatic attractive force generated between the probe electrode and the counter electrode flexes the probe and lifts the tip away from the substrate to suspend writing.",[Chang Liu][David Andrew Bullen],[The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois],"This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

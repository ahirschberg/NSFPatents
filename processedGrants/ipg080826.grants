According to an example embodiment of the present invention, a nanotube is adapted to pass current between two conductive elements. In one implementation, each conductive element includes a catalyst material, wherein electrical connection is made to opposite ends of the nanotube at each of the catalyst portions. In one implementation, the electrical connection is used to detect an electrical characteristic of the nanotube, such as the response of the nanotube to exposure to one or more of a variety of materials. In another implementation, the nanotube is used for chemical and biological sensing. In still another implementation, a particular functionality is imparted to the nanotube using one or more of a variety of materials coupled to the nanotube, such as metal particles, biological particles and/or layers of the same.",[Hongjie Dai][Jing Kong],[The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University],"This is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser.

In its principle, the temporal order of base additions during the polymerization reaction is measured on a molecule of nucleic acid, i.e. the activity of a nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme on the template nucleic acid molecule to be sequenced is followed in real time. The sequence is deduced by identifying which base is being incorporated into the growing complementary strand of the target nucleic acid by the catalytic activity of the nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme at each step in the sequence of base additions. A polymerase on the target nucleic acid molecule complex is provided in a position suitable to move along the target nucleic acid molecule and extend the oligonucleotide primer at an active site. A plurality of labelled types of nucleotide analogs are provided proximate to the active site, with each distinguishable type of nucleotide analog being complementary to a different nucleotide in the target nucleic acid sequence. The growing nucleic acid strand is extended by using the polymerase to add a nucleotide analog to the nucleic acid strand at the active site, where the nucleotide analog being added is complementary to the nucleotide of the target nucleic acid at the active site. The nucleotide analog added to the oligonucleotide primer as a result of the polymerizing step is identified. The steps of providing labelled nucleotide analogs, polymerizing the growing nucleic acid strand, and identifying the added nucleotide analog are repeated so that the nucleic acid strand is further extended and the sequence of the target nucleic acid is determined.",[Jonas Korlach][Watt W.

This is the case even when material losses are taken into account. Based on the dispersion analysis, in both a single hole or hole array designs, propagating modes play a dominant role in the transport properties of incident light. These structures exhibit a new region of operation, while featuring a high packing density and diffraction-less behavior. These structures can be used in near-field scanning optical microscopy, in collection and emission modes, for writing data to an optical storage device, as wavelength-selective optical filters, for multispectral imaging of a sample, as photolithography masks for transferring an image to a photoresist-coated substrate, as light emitters, light collectors and light modulators.",[Peter B.

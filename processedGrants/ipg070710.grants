07241432,20070710,Low temperature synthesis of semiconductor fibers,11515051,20070003467,20070104,"This invention presents a process to produce bulk quantities of nanowires of a variety of semiconductor materials. Large liquid gallium drops are used as sinks for the gas phase solute, generated in-situ facilitated by microwave plasma. To grow silicon nanowires for example, a silicon substrate covered with gallium droplets is exposed to a microwave plasma containing atomic hydrogen. A range of process parameters such as microwave power, pressure, inlet gas phase composition, were used to synthesize silicon nanowires as small as 4 nm (nanometers) in diameter and several micrometers long. As opposed to the present technology, the instant technique does not require creation of quantum sized liquid metal droplets to synthesize nanowires. In addition, it offers advantages such as lower growth temperature, better control over size and size distribution, better control over the composition and purity of the nanowires.",[Shashank Sharma][Mahendra Kumar Sunkara],[University of Louisville],"This Application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

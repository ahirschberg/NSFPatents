Specifically, SIMO FAWNA, which comprises a SIMO wireless channel interfaced with a fiber channel through wireless-to-optical interfaces. Received wireless signal at each interface are sampled and quantized prior to transmission. The capacity of the FAWNA approaches the capacity of the architecture exponentially with fiber capacity. It is also shown that for a given fiber capacity, there is an optimal method of operating wireless bandwidth and number of interfaces. An optimal method to divide the fiber capacity among the interfaces is shown, which ensures that each interface is allocated a rate so that noise is dominated by front end noise rather than by quantization distortion. A method is also presented in which, rather than dynamically changing rate allocation based on channel state, a less complex, fixed rate allocation may be adopted with very small loss in performance.",[Siddharth Ray][Muriel Medard][Lizhong Zheng],[Massachusetts Institute of Technology],"",20060929,This invention was made with government support awarded by The National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant Nos.

07381391,20080603,Method of making Group III nitrides,11650569,20070248526,20071025,"The present invention provides compositions and a novel high-yielding process for preparing high purity Group III nitrides. The process involves heating a Group III metal and a catalytic amount of a metal wetting agent in the presence of a nitrogen source. Group III metals can be stoichiometrically converted into high purity Group III nitride powders in a short period of time. The process can provide multi-gram quantities of high purity Group III nitrides in relatively short reaction times. Detailed characterizations of GaN powder were preformed and are reported herein, including morphology and structure by SEM and XRD, optical properties by cathodoluminescence (CL), and Raman spectra to determine the quality of the GaN particles. The purity of GaN powder was found to be greater than 99.9% pure, as analyzed by Glow Discharge Mass Spectrometry (GDMS). Green, yellow, and red light emission can be obtained from doped GaN powders.",[Michael G. Spencer][Francis J.

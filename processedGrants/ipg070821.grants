07259641,20070821,Microelectromechanical slow-wave phase shifter device and method,10906626,"","","The present invention provides a method and apparatus for a monolithic device utilizing cascaded, switchable slow-wave CPW sections that are integrated along the length of a planar transmission line. The purpose of the switchable slow-wave CPW sections elements is to enable control of the propagation constant along the transmission line while maintaining a quasi-constant characteristic impedance. The device can be used to produce true time delay phase shifting components in which large amounts of time delay can be achieved without significant variation in the effective characteristic impedance of the transmission line, and thus also the input/output return loss of the component. Additionally, for a particular value of return loss, greater time delay per unit length can be achieved in comparison to tunable capacitance-only delay components.",[Thomas Weller][Balaji Lakshminarayanan],[University of South Florida],"This application claims priority to provisional application entitled: &#x201C;True Time Delay Phase Shifting Method and Apparatus with Slow-Wave Elements,&#x201D; filed Feb. 27, 2004 by the present inventors and bearing application No. 60/521,146.",20050228,This invention was developed under support from the National Science Foundation under grant/contract number 2106-301-LO; accordingly the U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.,"","","",""

A self-assembled nanocrystal formation process by rapid thermal annealing of ultra thin metal film deposited on top of gate oxide is integrated with NMOSFET to fabricate such devices. Devices with Au, Ag, and Pt nanocrystals working in the F-N tunneling regime, with hot-carrier injection as the programming mechanism, demonstrate retention times up to 10s, and provide 2-bit-per-cell storage capability.",[Edwin C.

The state of a data structure is determined as “inconsistent” in accordance with a defined specification. In the event that a data structure is determined to be inconsistent, the data structure may be repaired. In the event that the repair fails in connection with a read or a write operation, the executing program may optionally take steps to allow the program to continue execution. In connection with a read operation, any value may be returned as a result of the read. In connection with a write operation, the data to be written is discarded such that no write of data is performed and program execution continues. The detection and repairs are determined in accordance with user specifications.",[Brian C. Demsky][Martin C.

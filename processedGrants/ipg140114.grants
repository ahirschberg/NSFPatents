08628599,20140114,Diamondoid stabilized fine-grained metals,12204763,20090061229,20090305,"Thermal stability of cryomilled Al+1% diamantane was investigated in the temperature range of 423 to 773K. Diamantane is a nanosized hydrocarbon molecule with a 14 carbon atom diamond cubic framework that is terminated by hydrogen atoms. Following the cryomilling of the Al powders and diamantane cages, the average grain size characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The as-cryomilled grain sized was found to be of the order of 22 nm, essentially the same as that for Al cryomilled without diamantane. To determine thermal stability, the powders were sealed in glass tubes in an Ar atmosphere to avoid oxidation and contamination and annealed at different temperatures between 423 and 773K for different holding times. Following these treatments, the grain size of cryomilled Al+1% diamantane was consistently less than that for cryomilled Al by about a factor of two. Preliminary investigations indicate that the grain growth exponent n decreased with increasing temperature, reaching a value of approximately 35 at 423 K. Such a high value of n suggests the operation of strong pinning forces on boundaries during annealing treatment. The thermal stability data were found to be consistent with Burke's model based on drag forces exerted by dispersion particles.",[James C. Earthman][Farghalli A. Mohamed][Rahul K.

The reduced dyes exhibit little or no fluorescence due to the disrupted π conjugation. However, upon reaction with ROS, the reduced dyes are oxidized, regenerating the extended π conjugation and causing a substantial increase in fluorescence intensity. In many case, the oxidized dye is generally membrane impermeable. However, upon reduction, many of the reduced dyes are membrane permeable. Thus, reduced dyes can accumulate in cells and/or tissue to amplify the signal. Once inside the cell or tissue, the reduced dye is reoxidized upon reaction with ROS, and the oxidized dye again becomes membrane impermeable, trapping the dye within the cell. The reduced dyes can be used to image ROS, such as hydroxide radical and superoxide, in serum, cell cultures, tissue explants, and in vivo.",[Niren Murthy][W. Robert Taylor][Kousik Kundu][Sarah F.

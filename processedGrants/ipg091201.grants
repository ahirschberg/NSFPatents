07624640,20091201,Opto-acoustic methods and apparatus for performing high resolution acoustic imaging and other sample probing and modification operations,11324866,20060272419,20061207,"An opto-acoustic transducer assembly includes a substrate; at least one layer of opto-acoustic material coupled to a surface of the substrate, where the at least one layer of opto-acoustic material generates sound waves when struck by pulses of pump light; and an acoustic lens configured to focus sound waves generated by the at least one layer of opto-acoustic material towards a sample. The acoustic lens is further configured to collect sound waves returning from the sample and to direct the returning sound waves to the at least one layer of opto-acoustic material. The at least one layer of opto-acoustic material is responsive to the returning sound waves for having at least one optical property thereof changed, where the change is detectable from a change in a characteristic of reflected pulses of probe light that are time delayed with respect to the pulses of pump light.",[Humphrey J.

07625497,20091201,Materials and methods for the preparation of anisotropically-ordered solids,10996133,20050253983,20051117,"The invention provides materials and methods for making anisotropic solids which may be in the form of films, layers, shaped elements, and other shaped articles. The methods provide anisotropic solids without the need for rolling, rubbing, or stretching to impart orientational alignment of the molecules of the solid. The methods employ organic or organometallic compounds which are soluble orienting molecules. The solvent or solvent system must be sufficiently volatile to be removed without disruption of the molecular orientation. The soluble orienting molecules include those containing one or more hydrophilic and/or ionic groups and the solvent or solvent system can be a polar organic solvent or solvent system or an aqueous solvent or solvent system. The invention also provides novel compounds having quaterrylene, perylene and naphthalene ring systems carrying one or more hydrophilic and/or ionic groups. These novel compounds can exhibit useful absorption and fluorescence properties in solution and in the solid phase and can exhibit useful liquid crystalline properties.",[Isaac K.

Frames A and B of a pair of successive video frames each comprise blocks of pixels. Frame A is earlier in time than frame B. A connection state of each pixel in frame B relative to the pixels of frame A is determined. The connection state is a connected state or an unconnected state. Each block in frame B is classified as either unconnected or uni-connected. Uni-connected blocks in frame B satisfying a reclassification criteria are reclassified as being unconnected. Each unconnected block in frame B is categorized as being a P-block or an I-block. Values for the pixels of each I-block in frame B are calculated by spatial interpolation based on values of nearest available neighbor pixels relative to each I-block. A residual error block for each I-block in frame B is generated.",[John W.

07627438,20091201,Observer based -control imaging methods for atomic force microscopy,11796205,"","","An observer based Q control method for a cantilever in an atomic force microscopy is provided that provides for a “dual” Q behavior such that a particular effective Q is achieved when a sample is present and another effective Q when a sample is absent. In the control method, the transfer function from dither input to photo-diode output is independent of the observer so that the cantilever effectively behaves like a spring-mass-damper system. The effective quality factor and stiffness of the cantilever can be changed by appropriately choosing the state feedback gain. The method provides sample-imaging using transient atomic force microscopy.",[Murti V.

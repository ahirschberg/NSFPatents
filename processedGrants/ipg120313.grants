The methods involve providing block copolymer materials blended with one or more transfer molecules or inks. The differences in chemistry of the blocks of the copolymer that result in micro-phase separation (e.g., self-assembly into nanoscale domains) also allow inks to be sequestered into specific blocks. By designing the ink molecules to react, adsorb, or otherwise interact with a second substrate, inks are transferred to the second substrate in a pattern dictated by the pattern of block copolymer domains present at the surface of the block copolymer film.","",[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation],"This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/072,744, filed Apr. 1, 2008, titled &#x201C;Molecular Transfer Printing Using Block Copolymers,&#x201D; which application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.",20090401,This invention was made with United States government support awarded by the following agencies: DOD DARPA HR0011-04-3-0002 and NSF 0425880.

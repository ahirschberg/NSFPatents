08656776,20140225,Temperature-robust MEMS gyroscope with 2-DOF sense-mode addressing the tradeoff between bandwidth and gain,13666494,20130074304,20130328,"The current invention is a novel gyroscope design, which yields devices robust to fabrication and environmental variations, allows flexible selection of operational parameters, and provides increased bandwidth with minimized sacrifice in gain regardless of the selected frequency of operation. The gyroscope has a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) drive-mode and a 2-DOF sense-mode. The drive-mode operational frequency and the sense-mode bandwidth can be selected arbitrarily in the proposed design, relaxing the tradeoff between the gain, die size, and detection capacitance.

07697145,20100413,System for fourier domain optical coherence tomography,10854426,20040239938,20041202,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging method which can image with micrometer-scale resolution up to a few millimeters deep into, for example, living biological tissues and preserved tissue samples. An improved apparatus and image reconstruction algorithm for parallel Fourier Domain OCT which greatly eases requirements for interferometer stability and also allows for more efficient parallel image acquisition is provided. The apparatuses and algorithms reconstruct images from interfered, low-coherence, multiwave length signals having a Ï€ radian phase difference relative to one another. Other numbers of signals and other phase differences may be alternatively used, with some combinations resulting in higher resolution and image stability. The apparatus also eliminates a need for bulk optics to modulate a phase delay in a reference arm of the optical path. Images may be reconstructed using two spectrometers, where each is coupled to a detector array such as a photodiode array.",[Joseph A.

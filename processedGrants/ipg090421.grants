07521003,20090421,Functionalized nanostructured lyotropic liquid crystal polymers,10544322,20060194927,20060831,"The invention provides cross-linked lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) copolymers having ordered nanometer-sized pores lined with functional groups. The copolymers are formed by copolymerizing LLC monomers with strong LLC character and functionalized monomers with no or weak LLC character to form an LLC phase. Both the LLC monomers and the functionalized monomers contain hydrogen-bonding groups and hydrogen-bonding is believed to assist in the formation of the LLC phase of the blended mixture. Different classes of functional groups useful for the invention include, but are not limited to, acidic groups, basic groups, catalytic groups, oxidizing agents, reducing agents, polymerization initiators, binding agents, optically active groups, and electrically active groups. The invention also provides methods for making the cross-linked LLC copolymers of the invention. In these methods, the LLC monomer and the functionalized monomer are blended in a polar solvent, thereby allowing self-assembly of the first and second monomer into an LLC phase.

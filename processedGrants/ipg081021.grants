07438953,20081021,Preparation of the layer-by-layer assembled materials from dispersions of highly anisotropic colloids,10457024,20040038007,20040226,"A method for the assembly of a thin film containing highly anisotropic colloids that includes the steps of immersing a substrate in a first solution or dispersion comprising a first substance, wherein the first substance has an affinity for the substrate. Then, immersing the substrate in a second solution or dispersion comprising a second substance, wherein the second substance has an affinity for the first substance. A least one of the first substance and the second substance is a highly anisotropic colloid having at least one dimension differing from the others by a ratio of at least 1:1.5. The method incorporates highly anisotropic colloids using a layer-by-layer process that circumvents the tendency for separation of nanotubes at high nanotube loadings. Additionally, the method incorporates aligned highly anisotropic colloids and provides a method for carbon nanotube alignment, which among other advantages makes possible the preparation of unique criss-crossed composites.",[Nicholas A.

In particular, the present invention provides techniques for producing DNA product molecules that may be easily and directly ligated to recipient molecules. The product molecules need not be cleaved with restriction enzymes in order to undergo such ligation. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the DNA product molecules are produced through iterative DNA synthesis reactions, so that the product molecules are amplified products. The invention further provides methods for directed ligation of product molecules (i.e., for selective ligation of certain molecules within a collection of molecules), and also for methods of exon shuffling, in which multiple different product molecules are produced in a single ligation reaction. Preferred embodiments of the invention involve ligation of product molecules encoding functional protein domains, particularly domains naturally found in conserved gene families. The inventive DNA manipulation system is readily integrated with other nucleic acid manipulation systems, such as ribozyme-mediated systems, and also is susceptible to automation.",[Kevin A.

07440590,20081021,System and technique for retrieving depth information about a surface by projecting a composite image of modulated light patterns,10444033,"","","A technique, associated system and program code, for retrieving depth information about at least one surface of an object. Core features include: projecting a composite image comprising a plurality of modulated structured light patterns, at the object; capturing an image reflected from the surface; and recovering pattern information from the reflected image, for each of the modulated structured light patterns. Pattern information is preferably recovered for each modulated structured light pattern used to create the composite, by performing a demodulation of the reflected image. Reconstruction of the surface can be accomplished by using depth information from the recovered patterns to produce a depth map/mapping thereof. Each signal waveform used for the modulation of a respective structured light pattern, is distinct from each of the other signal waveforms used for the modulation of other structured light patterns of a composite image; these signal waveforms may be selected from suitable types in any combination of distinct signal waveforms, provided the waveforms used are uncorrelated with respect to each other. The depth map/mapping to be utilized in a host of applications, for example: displaying a 3-D view of the object; virtual reality user-interaction interface with a computerized device; face—or other animal feature or inanimate object—recognition and comparison techniques for security or identification purposes; and 3-D video teleconferencing/telecollaboration.",[Laurence G.

07274451,20070925,Optical beam translation device and method utilizing a pivoting optical fiber,10943709,20050157291,20050721,"An alignment device and method for delivering a light beam to an optical application, such as an optical trap having a pair of lenses with overlapping focal regions for trapping a particle therein. The alignment device includes a light source for generating a beam of light, a support member, an optical fiber, a collimating lens, and actuators. The optical fiber includes an input end for receiving the beam of light, and a generally rigid portion extending from the support member and terminating in a delivery end for emitting the beam of light. The collimating lens collimates the emitted beam of light. The actuators exert forces on the generally rigid portion such that it pivots about a pivot point of the optical fiber at the support member. The collimated beam of light pivots about an optical pivot point as the optical fiber pivots about the pivot point.",[Carlos J. Bustamante][Steven B. Smith],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/504,067, filed Sep. 19, 2003.",20040917,This invention was made with Government support under grant (Contract) No. GM-32543 awarded by the NIH and grant nos.: MBC-9118482 and DBI-9732140 awarded by the NSF.

07275134,20070925,SCSI-to-IP cache storage device and method,10780108,20040267902,20041230,"A SCSI-to-IP cache storage system interconnects a host computing device or a storage unit to a switched packet network. The cache storage system includes a SCSI interface () that facilitates system communications with a host computing device or the storage unit, and an Ethernet interface () that allows the system to receive data from and send data to the Internet. The cache storage system further comprises a processing unit () that includes a processor (), a memory () and a log disk () configured as a sequential access device. The log disk () caches data along with the memory () resident in the processing unit (), wherein the log disk () and the memory () are configured as a two-level hierarchical cache.",[Qing Yang][Xubin He],"[Board of Governors for Higher Education, State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]","This application claims priority from PCT Application No. PCT/US02/26292 filed Aug. 15, 2002.

07360405,20080422,Method to transiently detect sample features using cantilevers,11421352,20060254346,20061116,An approach to determine cantilever movement is presented. An observer based state estimation and statistical signal detection and estimation techniques are applied to Atomic Force Microscopes. A first mode approximation model of the cantilever is considered and an observer is designed to estimate the dynamic states. The cantilever-sample interaction is modeled as an impulsive force applied to the cantilever in order to detect the presence of sample. A generalized likelihood ratio test is performed to obtain the decision rule and the maximum likelihood estimation of the unknown arrival time of the sample profile and unknown magnitude of it. The use of the transient data results in sample detection at least ten times faster than using the steady state characteristics.,[Murti V.

The chiral metal oxide surface is prepared by electrodeposition of a chiral metal oxide array from a solution of a chiral salt of the metal. In one embodiment, chiral CuO is grown on achiral Au(001) by epitaxial electrodeposition. The handedness of the film is determined by the specific enantiomer of tartrate ion in the deposition solution. (R,R)-tartrate produces an S—CuO(1  ) film, while (S,S)-tartrate produces an R—CuO( 1 1) film.

Modification of nucleic acid, including oligonucleotides, with reactive groups such as thiol groups provides for patterning with use of appropriate scanning probe microscopic tips under appropriate conditions. The reactive groups provide for chemisorption or covalent bonding to the substrate surface. The resulting nucleic acid features, which exhibit good stability, can be hybridized with complementary nucleic acids and probed accordingly with use of, for example, nanoparticles functionalized with nucleic acids.

07361412,20080422,Nanostructured soldered or brazed joints made with reactive multilayer foils,10844816,20050051607,20050310,Self-propagating formation reactions in nanostructured multilayer foils provide rapid bursts of heat at room temperature and therefore can act as local heat sources to melt solder or braze layers and join materials. This reactive joining method provides very localized heating to the components and rapid cooling across the joint. The rapid cooling results in a very fine microstructure of the solder or braze material. The scale of the fine microstructure of the solder or braze material is dependant on cooling rate of the reactive joints which varies with geometries and properties of the foils and components. The microstructure of the solder or braze layer of the joints formed by melting solder in a furnace is much coarser due to the slow cooling rate. Reactive joints with finer solder or braze microstructure show higher shear strength compared with those made by conventional furnace joining with much coarser solder or braze microstructure. It is expected that the reactive joints may also have better fatigue properties compared with conventional furnace joints.,[Jiaping Wang][Etienne Besnoin][Omar Knio][Timothy P.

In its principle, the temporal order of base additions during the polymerization reaction is measured on a molecule of nucleic acid, i.e. the activity of a nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme on the template nucleic acid molecule to be sequenced is followed in real time. The sequence is deduced by identifying which base is being incorporated into the growing complementary strand of the target nucleic acid by the catalytic activity of the nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme at each step in the sequence of base additions. A polymerase on the target nucleic acid molecule complex is provided in a position suitable to move along the target nucleic acid molecule and extend the oligonucleotide primer at an active site. A plurality of labelled types of nucleotide analogs are provided proximate to the active site, with each distinguishable type of nucleotide analog being complementary to a different nucleotide in the target nucleic acid sequence. The growing nucleic acid strand is extended by using the polymerase to add a nucleotide analog to the nucleic acid strand at the active site, where the nucleotide analog being added is complementary to the nucleotide of the target nucleic acid at the active site. The nucleotide analog added to the oligonucleotide primer as a result of the polymerizing step is identified. The steps of providing labelled nucleotide analogs, polymerizing the growing nucleic acid strand, and identifying the added nucleotide analog are repeated so that the nucleic acid strand is further extended and the sequence of the target nucleic acid is determined.",[Jonas Korlach][Watt W.

Surface-modified substrates that can be formed according to the disclosed processes are also provided. The process includes attachment of a multitude of nano- and/or submicron-sized structures to a surface to provide increased surface roughness. In addition, the process includes grafting a hydrophobic material to the surface in order to decrease the surface energy and decrease wettability of the surface. The combination of increased surface roughness and decreased surface energy can provide an ultrahydrophobic surface on the treated substrate.",[Igor A. Luzinov][Philip J. Brown][Killugudi L.

07985539,20110726,Nanoparticle probes with raman spectroscopic fingerprints for analyte detection,10431341,20040086897,20040506,"The invention encompasses reagents comprising particles with at least one Raman dye and a specific binding members bound thereto and methods of using such reagents. The invention also encompasses reagents of a specific binding member and two or more different Raman dyes and methods for using such reagents. New types of particle probes having a specific binding member bound thereto are described. These reagents are used in a novel detection strategy that utilizes the catalytic properties of the Au nanoparticles to generate a silver coating that can behave as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) promoter for the dye-labeled particles that have been captured by target and an underlying chip in microarray format. The strategy provides the high sensitivity and high selectivity attributes of grey-scale scanometric detection but provides a route to multiplexing and ratioing capabilities since a very large number of probes can be designed based upon the concept of using a Raman tag as a spectroscopic fingerprint in detection. These spectra are used as fingerprints to differentiate oligonucleotide or other targets in one solution. This method has been used to distinguish six dissimilar DNA targets with six Raman labeled nanoparticle probes, and also two RNA targets with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).",[Chad A.

07985869,20110726,Compositions of AU-11 nanoparticles and their optical properties,11920564,20090312565,20091217,"As demonstrated herein, the ligand exchange chemistry of phosphine-stabilized Auclusters with ω-functionalized thiols is a powerful synthetic method that provides convenient access to a diverse family of functionalized Auclusters. The general nature of the presented ligand exchange approach, in combination with the ease preparation, makes this approach of broad utility. The approach is general and shows the high tolerance for a wide variety of functional groups. Mechanistic studies provided conclusive evidence that the Aucore of the precursor particle remains intact during ligand exchange and showed that the ligand exchange of these particles follows a different pathway than for ligand exchanges of larger gold nanoparticles such as “Au(PPh)Cl”. Optical studies of the products show a strong dependence on the nature of the stabilizing thiol ligands.",[James E. Hutchison][Gerd H.

A successive requantizer fractional-N PLL of the invention has the potential to reduce power consumption and the cost of commercial communication devices. The successive requantizer performs digital quantization one bit at a time in such a way that the quantization noise can he engineered to have desirable properties such as non-linearity robustness.

Each VOQ at the input port has a sequence head pointer that is used to assign sequence numbers (SN) to the cells. Also a sequence tail pointer is available at each VOQ that is used to acknowledge and limit the amount of cells that can be sent to the output ports based on the window size of the scheme. Each VIQ at the output port has a sequence pointer or sequence number (SN) pointer that indicates to the VIQ which cell to wait for. Once the VIQ receives the cell that the SN pointer indicated, the output port sends an ACK packet back to the input port. By using sequence numbers and the relevant pointers, the packet out-of-sequence problem is solved.",[Jinsoo Park][Hung-Hsiang Jonathan Chao],[Polytechnic University],"This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser.

08109007,20120207,Object profile sensing,12455389,20100071222,20100325,A method for sensing an object profile shape involves relatively sweeping (whisking or translating) in angular or translational increments an elongated whisker element having a deflectable cantilever region and an object so that the cantilever region bends as a result of sliding along an object periphery. The moment (torque) at a base region of the whisker element as a result of the bending is determined. The method then iteratively determines successive contact point locations on the object periphery based on small successive increments in angle or position of the whisker element and the sensed moment (torque).,"",[Northwestern University],"This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser.

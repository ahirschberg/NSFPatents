08025932,20110927,Self-limiting thin film synthesis achieved by pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition,12026056,20080199632,20080821,"TaOand AlOthin films were fabricated by pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with simultaneous delivery of Oand the metal precursor. By appropriately controlling the gas-phase environment self-limiting deposition at controllable rates (˜1 Å/pulse) was obtained. The process was insensitive to substrate temperature, with a constant deposition rate observed from 90-350° C. As-deposited TaOfilms under these conditions displayed good dielectric properties. Performance improvements correlate strongly with film density and composition as measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Pulsed PECVD eliminates the need for gas actuation and inert purge steps required by atomic layer deposition.",[Colin Wolden][Michael T.

08026108,20110927,Detection of biotargets using bioreceptor functionalized nanoparticles,11875252,"","","An ultra sensitive method for detection of biomolecules includes the step of providing a plurality of bioreceptor functionalized nanoparticle probes. The nanoparticles can include metal, semiconductor, radioactive isotope or fluorescent dye molecules. A sample solution suspected of including the target is contacted with the probes, wherein if present, the target binds to the bioreceptor. After such binding a separating step follows. In the separating step, probes having the target bound thereto are separated from probes not having the target bound thereto. In one embodiment probes having the target bound thereto are then decomposed to generate ions, or broken into discrete radioactive isotopes or fluorescent dye molecules to form a solution including a large plurality of metal ions, radioactive isotopes or dye molecules. A concentration of ions, radioactive isotopes, or dye molecules in the solution is then determined and using this information the concentration of the target in the original sample solution is determined.",[Qun Huo][Xiong Liu][Qiu Dai],"[The University of Central Florida Research Foundation, Inc.]","The present application incorporates by reference in its entirety and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

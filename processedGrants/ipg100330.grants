Each VOQ at the input port has a sequence head pointer that is used to assign sequence numbers (SN) to the cells. Also a sequence tail pointer is available at each VOQ that is used to acknowledge and limit the amount of cells that can be sent to the output ports based on the window size of the scheme. Each VIQ at the output port has a sequence pointer or sequence number (SN) pointer that indicates to the VIQ which cell to wait for. Once the VIQ receives the cell that the SN pointer indicated, the output port sends an ACK packet back to the input port. By using sequence numbers and the relevant pointers, the packet out-of-sequence problem is solved.",[Jinsoo Park][Hung-Hsiang Jonathan Chao],"","This application claims benefit to U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

07689035,20100330,"Methods for identifying, separating and editing reflection components in multi-channel images and videos",11471091,20070132759,20070614,"The present invention presents a framework for separating specular and diffuse reflection components in images and videos. Each pixel of the an M-channel input image illuminated by N light sources is linearly transformed into a new color space having (Mâˆ’N) channels. For an RGB image with one light source, the new color space has two color channels (U,V) that are free of specularities and a third channel (S) that contains both specular and diffuse components. When used with multiple light sources, the transformation may be used to produce a specular invariant image. A diffuse RGB image can be obtained by applying a non-linear partial differential equation to an RGB image to iteratively erode the specular component at each pixel. An optional third dimension of time may be added for processing video images. After the specular and diffuse components are separated, dichromatic editing may be used to independently process the diffuse and the specular components to add or suppress visual effects. The (U,V) channels of images can be used as input to 3-D shape estimation algorithms including shape-from-shading, photometric stereo, binocular and multinocular stereopsis, and structure-from-motion.",[Satya P.

An quadratic timing model is used to represent each delay element along a circuit path, wherein each element's delay has a first-order relationship to local variations and a second-order relationship to global variations. Propagation of the modeled delays through the circuit is efficiently done via straightforward ADD operations where an input propagates through another element in a circuit path, and via a MAX operation (or an approximation thereof) where two or more inputs merge at an intersection. The inputs to the MAX operator can be tested for gaussianity, and can be processed by the MAX operation (or its approximation) if they are substantially gaussian. Otherwise, they may be stored in a tuple for processing at later points along the circuit path.",[Lizheng Zhang][Yuhen Hu][Chun-ping Chen],[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation],"",20060525,This invention was made with United States government support awarded by the following agencies:National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant No(s).: 0093309The United States has certain rights in this invention.,"","","",""

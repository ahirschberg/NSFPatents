08031926,20111004,Discrete event distribution sampling apparatus and methods,11986371,20090116707,20090507,"Locations of the origins of âdiscrete events,â e.g., photons or other units of radiant energy are acquired from a specimen with reference to a scan frame or other region of interest of the specimen. The location of origin of a discrete event can be determined from the corresponding location datum as derived from a scan-drive signal, a positional feed-back signal, or by a point in time during a unit of sampling time (âimage-acquisition periodâ) at which the event is detected. A probability-density function (PDF) is associated with the detected locations. Summing or other processing of the PDFs is performed to produce imagable data. From the data, images can be produced that require fewer discrete events to converge to an ideal density distribution associated with an image feature than required by pixel-based binning methods. Stored data can be mapped into pixels or voxels of a display or otherwise processed, including post hoc processing.",[John L.

One embodiment of the invention utilizes TRC, which is a lean communication layer placed between a network layer and the link layer of a network protocol stack. All aspects of the network protocol stack, with the exception of the routing protocol and data packet forwarding mechanism in the network layer, are unchanged. TRC takes charge of certain key functions of a routing protocol in order to minimize network attacks. Additionally, TRC implements highly accurate self-monitoring and reporting functionality that can be used by nodes in the network to detect compromised nodes. TRC of a node controls its ability to communicate with other nodes by providing non-repudiation of communications. The tamper-resistant nature of TRC provides high assurance that it cannot be bypassed or compromised.",[Rajendra V. Boppana][William H.

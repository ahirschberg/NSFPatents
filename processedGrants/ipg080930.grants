07429369,20080930,Silicon nanoparticle nanotubes and method for making the same,10864072,20080187480,20080807,"A relatively thick electrode is positioned opposite the surface of a substrate/second electrode. The electrode and the substrate surface are both contacted by a solution including silicon nanoparticles. The substrate surface is completely immersed in the solution in a manner such that there is not an air/solution interface and there is no meniscus at the substrate surface. Application of electrical potential between the electrode and the substrate creates a film of silicon nanoparticles on the substrate. Drying of the film induces the film to roll up and form a silicon nanoparticle nanotube material. A film may be subdivided into an array of identical portions, and the identical portions will roll into identical tubes having same length and diameter. A silicon nanoparticle nanotube material of the invention includes nanotubes formed of silicon nanoparticles.",[Munir H.

07429477,20080930,Controlling plant pathogens with bacterial/fungal antagonist combinations,10940036,20050096225,20050505,"Fungal/bacterial antagonist combinations, a seed coated with one of the combinations and a plant protected from plant pathogens by one of the combinations. The invention is also a fungal/bacterial antagonist combination comprising a fungal antagonist and a var. () bacterial antagonist and its use for controlling plant pathogens as a biocontrol agent, bio-pesticide or bio-fungicide. The invention also finds utility as a fungal/bacterial antagonist combination applied to the seed, stalk or leaf that results in an increase in plant yield. Control of early and late season stalk and root rot caused by fungi such as Fusarium, Phythium, Phytophthora and Penicillium in tomatoes, peppers, turf grass, soybeans, sunflower, wheat and corn is achieved.",[Thomas D.

07429735,20080930,High performance CCD-based thermoreflectance imaging using stochastic resonance,11376722,20060274151,20061207,"The invention is directed to systems and methods of digital signal processing and in particular to systems and methods for measurements of thermoreflectance signals, even when they are smaller than the code width of a digital detector used for detection. For example, in some embodiments, the number of measurements done is selected to be sufficiently large so as to obtain an uncertainty less than the code width of the detector. This allows for obtaining images having an enhanced temperature resolution. The invention is also directed to methods for predicting the uncertainty in measurement of the signal based on one or more noise variables associated with the detection process and the number of measurement iterations.",[Dietrich Lueerssen][Rajeev J.

07429860,20080930,Noise reduction for spectroscopic signal processing,10766599,20040239323,20041202,"A windowed noise reduction technique is presented that allows a noise-reduced spectrum of satisfactory accuracy to be recovered from original noisy spectroscopic data, while acquiring a significantly reduced number of transient acquisitions. The signal-averaged, decimated signal is written as a sum of a noisefree component and a noise component, and a vector space that contains a noisefree subspace and a noise subspace is created using these decimated signals. A correlation matrix is constructed in this vector space, and diagonalized to yield the singular values. The appearance of a clear gap between the noisefree singular values and the noise singular values, in a singular value graph, and the stability of the gap, supplies the criteria for determining that a sufficient number of iterations has been performed.",[Howard S.

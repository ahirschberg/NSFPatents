Methods in accordance with the present invention comprise growing a Group-III nitride thin-film material while applying an ion flux and preferably while the substrate is stationary or non-rotating substrate. The ion flux is preferably applied as an ion beam at a glancing angle of incidence. Growth under these conditions creates a nanoscale surface corrugation having a characteristic features size, such as can be measured as a wavelength or surface roughness. After the surface corrugation is created, and preferably in the same growth reactor, the substrate is rotated in an ion flux which cause the surface corrugation to be reduced. The result of forming a surface corrugation and then subsequently reducing or removing the surface corrugation is the formation of a nanosculpted region and polished transition region that effectively filter dislocations.

Methods of the present invention, referred to as carbon combustion synthesis of oxides (CCSO), are a modification of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) methods in which the heat needed for the synthesis is generated by combustion of carbon in oxygen rather than that of a pure metal. This enables a more economic production of the ceramic material and minimizes the presence of intermediate metal oxides in the product. The reactant mixture generally comprises at least one oxide precursor (e.g., a metal or non metal oxide, or super oxide, or nitride, or carbonate, or chloride, or oxalate, or halides) as a reactant, but no pure metal. Pure carbon in the form of graphite or soot is added to the reactant mixture to generate the desired heat (upon ignition). The mixture is placed in a reactor and exposed to gaseous oxygen. The high-temperature exothermic reaction between the carbon and oxygen generates a self-sustaining reaction in the form of a propagating temperature wave that causes a reaction among the reactants. The reaction proceeds rapidly following ignition, and the final product comprises simple and/or complex oxides of elements present in the oxide precursor(s). CCSO also enables synthesis of oxides that cannot be produced by conventional SHS, such as when the pure metal is pyrophoric (such as Li or La) or such as when it melts at room temperature (e.g., Ga) or such as the combustion heat of the metal is relatively low.",[Karen S.

07925711,20110412,Centralized adaptive network memory engine,11957411,"","","There is a constant battle to break even between continuing improvements in DRAM capacities and the growing memory demands of large-memory high-performance applications. Performance of such applications degrades quickly once the system hits the physical memory limit and starts swapping to the local disk. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of Anemone—an Adaptive Network Memory Engine—that virtualizes the collective unused memory of multiple machines across a gigabit Ethernet LAN, without requiring any modifications to the either the large memory applications or the Linux kernel. We have implemented a working prototype of Anemone and evaluated it using real-world unmodified applications such as ray-tracing and large in-memory sorting. Our results with the Anemone prototype show that unmodified single-process applications execute 2 to 3 times faster and multiple concurrent processes execute 6 to 7.7 times faster, when compared to disk based paging. The Anemone prototype reduces page-fault latencies by a factor of 19.6—from an average of 9.8 ms with disk based paging to 500 μs with Anemone. Most importantly, Anemone provides a virtualized low-latency access to potentially “unlimited” network memory resources.",[Kartik Gopalan][Michael Hines][Jian Wang],[The Research Foundation of State University of New York],"The present application claims benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/870,320, filed Dec. 15, 2006, the entirety of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.",20071215,This invention was developed in part under National Science Foundation Grant No. 0509131.,"","","",""

In this study it is shown that the microalga can be engineered to import glucose and grow in the dark through the introduction of genes encoding glucose transporters. Both the human and glucose transporters facilitated the uptake of glucose by , allowing the cells to metabolize exogenous organic carbon and thrive, independent of light. This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene. Since strains transformed with the glucose transport genes are able to grow non-photosynthetically, they can be exploited for the analysis of photosynthetic processes through mutant generation and characterization. Finally, this work also represents critical progress toward large-scale commercial exploitation of obligate phototrophic algae through the use of microbial fermentation technology, eliminating significant limitations resulting from light-dependent growth.",[Kirk Emil Apt][F.

Thus, devices according to the invention allow for continuous potentiometric pH measurements with occasional spectrophotometric calibrations. The spectrophotometric calibration device consists of a spectrophotometer with associated pumps for combining a sulfonephthalein pH indicator with the aqueous medium whose pH is to be measured. The device will record potentiometric pH measurements for an extended period of time until the spectrophotometric device is autonomously activated for another calibration.

One advantage is that queuing delay can be more accurately estimated than loss probability. This is because packet losses in networks with large bandwidth-delay product are rare events under TCP Reno and its variants (probability on the order 10or smaller), and because loss samples provide coarser information than queuing delay samples. Indeed, measurements of delay are noisy, just as those of loss probability. Thus, another advantage of the present invention is that each measurement of queuing delay provides multi-bit information while each measurement of packet loss (whether a packet is lost) provides only one bit of information for the filtering of noise. This makes it easier for an equation-based implementation to stabilize a network into a steady state with a target fairness and high utilization.

One object of the game is to have each player type exactly what his or her partner is typing or has already typed. Once both players type the same string of words or letters, they receive a new image (the players are not required to type the string at the same time). The string upon which the two players agree is used as a label for that image. When trying to agree on a word, players may not be able to type certain specific strings of characters or “forbidden words”.

Also a sequence tail pointer is available at each VOQ that is used to acknowledge and limit the amount of cells that can be sent to the output ports based on the window size of the scheme. Each VIQ at the output port has a sequence pointer or sequence number (SN) pointer that indicates to the VIQ which cell to wait for. Once the VIQ receives the cell that the SN pointer indicated, the output port sends an ACK packet back to the input port.

This is the first successful trophic conversion of an obligate photoautotroph through metabolic engineering, and it demonstrates that methods of cell nourishment can be fundamentally altered with the introduction of a single gene.

With this method, the message bits are divided into multiple submessages and the bits in each layer are encoded using a standard error correction code to provide a plurality of subcodewords. A first linear transformation is applied to each of the subcodewords. The so-transformed subcodewords from the different submessages are then combined to form a first redundancy block to be transmitted. Additional redundancy blocks are generated by repeating this process on the same message but with jointly related nonidentical sets of linear transformations. The result is a set of codewords for each message which are then used to generate a transmitted waveform in one of several different ways, depending upon the application. For example, the codewords can be used in sequence (temporally) to form a rateless code for transmission over channels of unknown quality, in which case a receiver accumulates as many of the codewords as are necessary to successfully decode. As another example, the codewords can be spatially distributed if the channel has multiple-inputs, as would be the case in a multi-antenna system.

Most production grids are essentially multi-site supercomputer centers, rather than truly open and heterogeneous sets of resources that can join and leave dynamically, and that can provide support for an equally dynamic set of users. Large-scale grids containing individual resources with more autonomy about when and how they join and leave will require self-organizing grid middleware services that do not require centralized administrative control. Dynamic discovery of high-performance variable-size clusters of grid nodes provides an effective solution for implementation of grids. A brute force approach to the problem of identifying these “ad-hoc clusters” would require excessive overhead in terms of both message exchange and computation. Therefore, a scalable solution is provided that uses a delay-based overlay structure to organize nodes based on their proximity to one another, using a small number of delay experiments. This overlay can then be used to provide a variable-size set of promising candidate nodes than can then be used as a cluster, or tested further to improve the selection.

A key feature of the device is that, rather than being calibrated conventionally with buffers, it can be calibrated with an in situ device that measures pH spectrophotometrically. Spectrophotometric pH measurements obtained via sulfonephthalein absorbance measurements are inherently calibrated (do not require buffers). Thus, devices according to the invention allow for continuous potentiometric pH measurements with occasional spectrophotometric calibrations. The spectrophotometric calibration device consists of a spectrophotometer with associated pumps for combining a sulfonephthalein pH indicator with the aqueous medium whose pH is to be measured. The device will record potentiometric pH measurements for an extended period of time until the spectrophotometric device is autonomously activated for another calibration. In this manner precise and accurate pH measurements can be obtained continuously in the environment, and the low energy expenditure of the potentiometric device provides excellent endurance.

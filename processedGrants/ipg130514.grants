This binding process changes the conformation of the mRNA, which causes a change in gene expression by a variety of different mechanisms. Modified versions of these natural “riboswitches” (created by using various nucleic acid engineering strategies) can be employed as designer genetic switches that are controlled by specific effector compounds. Such effector compounds that activate a riboswitch are referred to herein as trigger molecules. The natural switches are targets for antibiotics and other small molecule therapies. In addition, the architecture of riboswitches allows actual pieces of the natural switches to be used to construct new non-immunogenic genetic control elements, for example the aptamer (molecular recognition) domain can be swapped with other non-natural aptamers (or otherwise modified) such that the new recognition domain causes genetic modulation with user-defined effector compounds.

08443034,20130514,Input vector selection for reducing current leakage in integrated circuits,12479584,20100308895,20101209,"Techniques are generally described for selecting input vectors that reduce or minimize leakage current for a plurality of integrated circuits (ICs) with the same design, but that differ due to manufacturing variability. In various embodiments, the techniques include determining at least one starting input vector that reduces leakage current in a respective one of N instances of the ICs, and selecting from the determined at least one starting input vector of each respective one of the N instances, a set R of representative input vectors. Some of the embodiments then use each of the representative input vectors in the set R to determine at least a particular input vector to apply to input terminals of an IC in the plurality of ICs to reduce or minimize leakage current in the IC. Additional variants and embodiments may also be disclosed.",[Farinaz Koushanfar][Miodrag Potkonjak],"[Empire Technology Development, LLC]","",20090605,"The work described herein was supported at least in part by National Science Foundation (NSF) grant no. 0716674, and at least in part by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Microsystems Technology Office (DARPA/MTO) Young Faculty Award (YFA) grant no.

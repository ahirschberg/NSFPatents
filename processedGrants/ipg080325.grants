07349098,20080325,Simultaneous beam-focus and coherence-gate tracking for real-time optical coherence tomography,11332780,20060170930,20060803,"Method and apparatus for achieving dynamic focus tracking during real-time optical coherence tomography (OCT) by simultaneously implementing geometric focus tracking (GFT) and coherence gate tracking (CGT). GFT tracking involves changing a position of the focal point of the OCT probe in the sample during scanning. Preferably, the focal point is moved relative to the sample without disrupting the Gaussian beam profile of the scanner. CGT involves determining a change in the optical path length of the sample arm due to the GFT, and calculating the change in the optical path length in the reference arm required to maintain an equivalent optical path length in both the sample arm and the reference arm. The reference arm is then translated by the required amount, to maximize the OCT signal. A lateral priority scanning technique is employed, and this technique can be implemented using a single optical fiber suitable for endoscopic use.",[Xingde Li],[University of Washington],"This application is based on a prior provisional application, Ser.

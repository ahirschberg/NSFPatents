08615804,20131224,Complementary character encoding for preventing input injection in web applications,13030657,20110252475,20111013,"Method to prevent the effect of web application injection attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), which are major threats to the security of the Internet. Method using complementary character coding, a new approach to character level dynamic tainting, which allows efficient and precise taint propagation across the boundaries of server components, and also between servers and clients over HTTP. In this approach, each character has two encodings, which can be used to distinguish trusted and untrusted data. Small modifications to the lexical analyzers in components such as the application code interpreter, the database management system, and (optionally) the web browser allow them to become complement aware components, capable of using this alternative character coding scheme to enforce security policies aimed at preventing injection attacks, while continuing to function normally in other respects. This approach overcomes some weaknesses of previous dynamic tainting approaches by offering a precise protection against persistent cross-site scripting attacks, as taint information is maintained when data is passed to a database and later retrieved by the application program. The technique is effective on a group of vulnerable benchmarks and has low overhead.",[Raymond Mui][Phyllis Frankl],[Polytechnic Institute of New York University],"This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/305,765 having a filing date of 18 Feb. 2010, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.",20110218,"This invention was partially supported by the U.S. Department of Education GAANN grant P200A090157, U.S. National Science Foundation grant CCF 0541087, and the Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications sponsored by NYSTAR.

07281419,20071016,Multifunctional probe array system,11234401,20070062264,20070322,"A probe array for includes a handle, a first probe and a second probe. The first probe has a first shank, connected to the handle, and a first tip; and the second probe has a second shank, connected to the handle, and second tip. The first tip contains a different material from the second tip. The probe array may be used to write on a surface by contacting the first tip with a surface, where a first ink is on the first tip. This writing method may further include lifting the first tip from the surface and contacting the second tip with the surface.",[Xuefeng Wang][Chang Liu],[The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/719,158 entitled &#x201C;Multifunctional Probe Array System&#x201D; filed Sep. 21, 2005, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.",20050923,"The subject matter of this application may have been funded in part under a research grant from the National Science Foundation, under NSF Grant Number EEC-0118025.

07282105,20071016,Support planar and tapered quasi-planar germanium waveguides for infrared evanescent-wave sensing,10320895,"","","Miniature planar IR waveguides of thickness 30–50 μm, consisting of 12-mm long, 2-mm wide strips of Ge supported on ZnS substrates and tapered quasi-tapered waveguides, tapered from a thickness of 1 mm at the ends to a minimum of 1–100 μm at the center, are disclosed. The surface sensitivity is increased as a function of incidence or bevel angle. The tapered waveguide improves the efficiency of the optical coupling both into the waveguide from an FTIR spectrometer, and out of the waveguide onto a small-area IR detector. The tapering makes it possible to dispense with using an IR microscope couple light through the waveguide, enabling efficient coupling with a detector directly coupled to an immersion lens. This optical arrangement makes such thin supported waveguides more useful as sensors, because they can be made quite long (e.g. 50 mm) and mounted horizontally. Furthermore, even with a 20-μm×1-mm cross section, sufficient throughput is obtained to give signal/noise ratios in excess of 1000 over most of the 1000–5000 cm-range, with just 2 min of scanning at 8 cm-resolution.",[Susan E.

Dynamic, real time tunability is achieved by the application of a variable force with a MEMS actuator or other means. The force induces changes in the crystal structure of the photonic crystal, and consequently modifies the photonic band structure. The concept was demonstrated by a theoretical investigation on the effect of mechanical stress on the anomalous refraction behavior of the flexible PC, and a very wide tunability in beam propagation direction was observed. Experimental studies on fabrication and characterizations of the flexible photonic crystal structures were also carried out. High quality flexible PC structures were fabricated by e-beam lithography and anisotropic etching processes.",[Wounjhang Park][Jeong-Bong Lee][Mark T. Tinker][Ethan F.

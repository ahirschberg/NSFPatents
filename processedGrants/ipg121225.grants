The fluidically integrated jet transports ambient gas or liquid into the jet/sensor assembly through integrated gas or liquid channels, impinges the sample gas or liquid on the sensing element, and finally ejects the sample gas or liquid back into the ambient gas or liquid. The response of the sensor in the presence of the active jet is compared to its response when the jet is inactive. The jet actuator directs entrained ambient gas or liquid toward the active surface of the sensor, and the impingement of sample gas or liquid onto the surface of the sensor results in faster response time.

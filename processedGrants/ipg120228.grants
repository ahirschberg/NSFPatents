MOFs are also useful as sorbents in new compact and portable micropreconcentrator designs such as a modified purge and trap system and a multi-valve microelectromechanical system (MEMS) to achieve high gain in analyte detection. Further, MOFs may be used as coatings for novel microstructure arrays in micropreconcentrators where the microstructures are designed to increase the surface area to volume ratio inside the micropreconcentrator while minimizing the pressure drop across the micropreconcentrator.","",[The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois],"This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/724,313, filed on Oct. 6, 2005, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/791,988, filed on Apr. 14, 2006, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/828,266, filed Oct. 5, 2006, the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.",20061006,"This invention was made, at least in part, with U.S. government support under U.S. Air Force Grant No. FA8650-04-1-7121, awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and under NSF Grant No. DMI 03-28162 and NSF Grant No. CTS 01-20978, awarded by the National Science Foundation.

08124583,20120228,Composition and method for self-assembly and mineralization of peptide-amphiphiles,12489401,20100221224,20100902,"The present invention is directed to a composition useful for making homogeneously mineralized self assembled peptide-amphiphile nanofibers and nanofiber gels. The composition is generally a solution comprised of a positively or negatively charged peptide-amphiphile and a like signed ion from the mineral. Mixing this solution with a second solution containing a dissolved counter-ion of the mineral and/or a second oppositely charged peptide amphiphile, results in the rapid self assembly of the peptide-amphiphiles into a nanofiber gel and templated mineralization of the ions. Templated mineralization of the initially dissolved mineral cations and anions in the mixture occurs with preferential orientation of the mineral crystals along the fiber surfaces within the nanofiber gel. One advantage of the present invention is that it results in homogenous growth of the mineral throughout the nanofiber gel. Another advantage of the present invention is that the nanofiber gel formation and mineralization reactions occur in a single mixing step and under substantially neutral or physiological pH conditions. These homogeneous nanostructured composite materials are useful for medical applications especially the regeneration of damaged bone in mammals. This invention is directed to the synthesis of peptide-amphiphiles with more than one amphiphilic moment and to supramolecular compositions comprised of such multi-dimensional peptide-amphiphiles.

The overall synthetic strategy for the preparation of these block cationomers comprised four steps: 1) Synthesis by living cationic polymerization of mono- and di-allyltelechelic polyisobutylenes, 2) End group transformation to obtain PIBs fitted with termini capable of mediating the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of DMAEMA, 3) ATRP of DMAEMA and 4) Quaternization of PDMAEMA to PDMAEMAI by CHI.

07166325,20070123,Carbon nanotube devices,10299610,20030068432,20030410,"Nanotubes and nanotube-based devices are implemented in a variety of applications. According to an example embodiment of the present invention, a nanotube device is manufactured having a nanotube extending between two conductive elements. In one implementation, each conductive element includes a catalyst portion, wherein electrical connection is made to opposite ends of the nanotube at each of the catalyst portions. In one implementation, the conductive elements are coupled to circuitry for detecting an electrical characteristic of the nanotube, such as the response of the nanotube to exposure to one or more of a variety of materials. In another implementation, the nanotube device is adapted for chemical and biological sensing. In still another implementation, a particular functionality is imparted to the nanotube using one or more of a variety of materials coupled to the nanotube, such as metal particles, biological particles and/or layers of the same.",[Hongjie Dai][Jing Kong],[The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University],"This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser.

The problem of finding the pair of half pulses is rephrased in the inverse scattering formalism and a simple closed form algorithm for the solution is given, provided the target transverse profile has constant phase (modulo 180°). The problem has a unique low energy solution for sufficiently small, complex valued data, and an algorithm for finding the solution is provided. This solution is used to generate pairs of half pulses for given target transverse profiles.",[Jeremy Magland][Charles L.

In accordance with one embodiment, a crystal growth architecture is separated by a permeable membrane from an adjacent well having a much larger volume. The well may be configured to contain a fluid having an identity and concentration similar to the solvent and crystallizing agent employed in crystal growth, with diffusion across the membrane stabilizing that process. Alternatively, the well may be configured to contain a fluid having an identity calculated to affect the crystallization process. In accordance with the still other embodiment, the well may be configured to contain a material such as a cryo-protectant, which is useful in protecting the crystalline material once formed.",[Carl L.

As used herein the term “kinetically stable protein” means a protein that is trapped in a specific conformation due to an unusually high unfolding barrier that results in very slow unfolding rates. The present inventors are the first to discover the existence of a correlation between kinetic stability and SDS-induced denaturation. Thus, the invention provides methods for identifying kinetically stable proteins comprising the step of testing the proteins for resistance to denaturation by SDS. In one embodiment, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is one simple method for quickly identifying and selecting kinetically stable proteins. In another embodiment a two-dimensional SDS-PAGE provides a high throughput method for quickly identifying kinetically stable proteins in a sample.",[Wilfredo Colón][Marta Manning],[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute],"This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser.

07217427,20070515,Polymersomes and related encapsulating membranes,10882816,20050048110,20050303,"The present invention provides biocompatible vesicles comprising semi-permeable, thin-walled encapsulating membranes which are formed in an aqueous solution, and which comprise one or more synthetic super-amphiphilic molecules. When at least one super-amphiphile molecule is a block copolymer, the resulting synthetic vesicle is termed a “polymersome.” The synthetic, reactive nature of the amphiphilic composition enables extensive, covalent cross-linking of the membrane, while maintaining semi-permeability. Cross-linking of the polymer building-block components provides mechanical control and long-term stability to the vesicle, thereby also providing a means of controlling the encapsulation or release of materials from the vesicle by modifying the composition of the membrane. Thus, the encapsulating membranes of the present invention are particularly suited for the reliable, durable and controlled transport, delivery and storage of materials.",[Dennis E.

In one embodiment, the alloy is InGaN having an energy bandgap range of approximately 0.7 eV to 3.4 eV, providing a good match to the solar energy spectrum. Multiple junctions having different bandgaps are stacked to form a solar cell. Each junction may have different bandgaps (realized by varying the alloy composition), and therefore be responsive to different parts of the spectrum.

07218448,20070515,Extended depth of field optical systems,09070969,"","","A system for increasing the depth of field and decreasing the wavelength sensitivity of an incoherent optical system incorporates a special purpose optical mask into the incoherent system. The optical mask has been designed to cause the optical transfer function to remain essentially constant within some range from the in-focus position. Signal processing of the resulting intermediate image undoes the optical transfer modifying effects of the mask, resulting in an in-focus image over an increased depth of field. Generally the mask is placed at or near an aperture stop or image of the aperture stop of the optical system. Preferably, the mask modifies only phase and not amplitude of light, though amplitude may be changed by associated filters or the like. The mask may be used to increase the useful range of passive ranging systems.","[Wade Thomas Cathey, Jr.][Edward Raymond Dowski, Jr.]",[The Regents of the University of Colorado],"This application is a continuation in part of patent application Ser.

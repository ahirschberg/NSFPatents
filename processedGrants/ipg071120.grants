The instrument is suited for biochemical reactions, particularly DNA-based reactions such as the polymerase chain reaction, that require thermal cycling since the inherently small size of the instrument facilitates rapid cycle times. The integrated nature of the instrument provides accurate, contamination-free processing. The instrument may include reagent reservoirs, agitators and mixers, heaters, pumps, and optical or electromechanical sensors.

A TCP source monitors received acknowledgments (ACKs) and uses header information associated with the ACKs to determine an amount of data delivered at a TCP receiver. The amount of delivered data, divided by the time requited to deliver the data, gives a measure of instant data rate. The instant data rate is input to a filtering and averaging process to generate an estimate of the end-to-end bandwidth share or data rate of the connection. For the entire duration of the connection, the TCP source updates its estimate of the end-to-end bandwidth share every time an ACK is received. The estimate of the end-to-end bandwidth share is used the reset a congestion window and a slow start threshold whenever packet loss is indicated such as whenever a timeout expires or whenever three (3) duplicate ACKs are received.",[Mario Gerla][M.

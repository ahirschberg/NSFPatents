In some aspects, the invention relates to methods, articles and compositions for the detection and analysis of biomolecules in a sample. Provided assays include those determining the presence of a target biomolecule in a sample or its relative amount, or the assays may be quantitative or semi-quantitative. The methods can be performed on a substrate. The methods can be performed in an array format on a substrate, which can be a sensor. In some embodiments, detection assays are provided employing sensor biomolecules that do not comprise a fluorophore that can exchange energy with the cationic multichromophore. In some aspects biological assays are provided in which energy is transferred between one or more of the multichromophore, a label on the target biomolecule, a label on the sensor biomolecule, and/or a fluorescent dye specific for a polynucleotide, in all permutations. The multichromophore may interact at least in part electrostatically with the sensor and/or the target, and an increase in energy transfer with the polymer may occur upon binding of the sensor and the target. Other variations of the inventions are described further herein.",[Guillermo C.

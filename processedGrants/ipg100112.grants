07645308,20100112,Osmium diboride compounds and their uses,11578029,20070224100,20070927,"Osmium, when combined with boron alone, or in combination with rhenium, ruthenium or iron, produces compounds that are ultra-hard and incompressible. These osmium diboride compounds are useful as a substitute to for other super or ultra-hard materials that are used in cutting tools and as abrasives. The osmium diboride compounds have the formula  OsMB  where M is rhenium, ruthenium or iron and x is from 0.01 to 1, except when x is not 1 and M is rhenium, x is from 0.01 to 0.3. ",[Richard B.

07645327,20100112,Fractal structured nanoagglomerates as filter media,11416034,20090293719,20091203,"Systems and methods for achieving filtration are provided that utilize agglomerates or granules of nanoparticles. The agglomerates or granules of nanoparticles may be used as and/or incorporated into a HEPA filtration system to remove solid or liquid submicron-sized particles, e.g., MPPS, in an efficient and efficacious manner. The filtration systems and methods are provided that utilize agglomerates or granules in a size range of about 100-500 microns. The agglomerates or granules of nanoparticles exhibit a hierarchical fractal structure. In the case of agglomerates of nanoparticles, porosities of 0.9 or greater are generally employed, and for granules of nanoparticles, porosities that are smaller than 0.9 may be employed. Filter media formed from the agglomerates or granules may be formed from materials such as carbon black and fumed silica, and may be employed in baffled or non-baffled filtration apparatus.",[Robert Pfeffer][Rajesh Dave][Stanislav Dukhin][Jose A.

The photovoltaic cells include at least one contact made from a first contact material, at least one contact made from a second contact material and a plurality of photoconducting carbon nanotubes bridging the contacts. A Schottky barrier is formed at the interface between the first contact material and the carbon nanotubes while at the interface between the second contact material and the carbon nanotubes, a Schottky barrier for the opposite carrier is formed, or a small, or no Schottky barrier is formed. It is the Schottky barrier asymmetry that allows the photo-excited electron-hole pairs to escape from the carbon nanotube device.",[Todd R. Narkis][Matt S. Marcus][Max G. Lagally][Mark A.

A contour of that object is extracted from the image and normalized. Based on the normalized contour, one or more summation invariant values are determined and compared to templates comprising one or more summation invariants for each of one or more target objects. The determined summation invariants for the extracted object are compared to summation invariants for the target objects. When the summation invariants for the extracted object sufficiently match the summation invariants determined from an image of a target object, the extracted object is recognized as that target object. The summation invariants can be semi-local summation invariants determined for each point along the normalized contour, based on a number of points neighboring that point on the normalized contour. The semi-local summation invariants are determined as a function of the x and y coordinates of those points.",[Wei-Yang Lin][Nigel Boston][Yu Hen Hu],[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation],"This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

Users are connected to the server, e.g., through a computer network or the Internet, to enable data transfers and to transact licenses to utilize the media. Packaged electronic media are typically created by an author or derivative user of the work. Once the packaged media is registered on the server, the media is made available for limited use and possible license through an authorization server. This limited use is specified within the minimum permissions data set assigned to each packaged media. Without a license, users are typically permitted to view the packaged media—through a system which unpackages the media—but cannot save or otherwise transfer the media without obtaining auxiliary permissions to do so from the authorization server. The electronic media is authenticated through digital signatures and optional encryption.",[John S.

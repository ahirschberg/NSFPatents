07378655,20080527,Apparatus and method for sensing electromagnetic radiation using a tunable device,10821790,20050017177,20050127,"A method for manufacturing a sensing device, such as a bolometer device or other devices. The method includes providing a substrate, e.g., silicon wafer. The method includes forming a first reflection layer overlying the substrate and forming a first electrode layer overlying the substrate. The method includes forming a sacrificial layer overlying a portion of the first reflection layer and a portion of the first electrode layer. The sacrificial layer is patterned using photolithography techniques. The patterned sacrificial layer corresponds to a cavity region. The method also forms a second electrode layer overlying the sacrificial layer and forms an elastic layer overlying the patterned sacrificial layer. The elastic layer encloses the cavity region corresponding to the patterned sacrificial layer. The method releases the sacrificial layer to form an opening in the cavity region.",[Yu-Chong Tai][Matthieu Liger][Ming C.

The invention includes a joint method for simultaneous SR, deblurring, and demosaicing, this way taking into account practical color measurements encountered in video sequences. For the case of translational motion and common space-invariant blur, the proposed invention is based on a very fast and memory efficient approximation of the Kalman filter (KF). Experimental results on both simulated and real data are supplied, demonstrating the invention algorithms, and their strength.",[Peyman Milanfar][Sina Farsiu][Michael Elad],"[The Regents of the University of California, Santa Cruz]","",20061019,The present invention was supported in part by grant number CCR-9984246 and F49620-03-01-0387 from the National Science Foundation and U.S. Air Force.

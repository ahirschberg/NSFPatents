In one embodiment, carbon dioxide gas pressure is applied to the solvent at a pressure effective to enhance the solubility of the fluorinated compound. The method may further include recrystallizing the fluorinated compound by reducing the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas. Also provided are methods of conducting a reaction using a fluorinated compound in an organic solvent. In one embodiment, the method comprises applying carbon dioxide pressure to an organic solvent comprising at least one substrate and a fluorinated catalyst, in an effective amount to solubilize the catalyst; and permitting the fluorinated catalyst to catalyze the reaction of the substrate to form a product. The catalyst is optionally separated from the reaction product and solvent after the reaction by the release of the pressure.",[Charles A. Eckert][Philip G. Jessop][Charles L.

Our duplex qPCR for nDNA/mtDNA had a linear quantitation range of 100 ng to 1 pg, and our triplex qPCR assay for nDNA/mtDNA/male Y DNA had a linear range of 100 ng to 0.1 ng. Human-specificity was demonstrated by the accurate detection of 0.05% and 5% human DNA, respectively, from a complex source of starting templates. Target-specificity was confirmed by the lack of cross-amplification among targets. A high throughput alternative for human gender determination was also developed by multiplexing the male Y primer/probe set with an X chromosome based system. Background cross-amplification with DNA templates derived from fourteen other species was negligible aside from the male Y assay which produced spurious amplifications from other non-human primate templates. Mainstream application of these assays will undoubtedly benefit forensic genomics.",[Jerilyn A. Walker][Dale J. Hedges][Jaiprakash G. Shewale][Sudhir K. Sinha][Mark A.

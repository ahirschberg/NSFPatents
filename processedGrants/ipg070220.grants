07179356,20070220,Biomimetic pathways for assembling inorganic thin films and oriented mesoscopic silicate patterns through guided growth,10411641,20040020774,20040205,A process directed to preparing surfactant-polycrystalline inorganic nanostructured materials having designed microscopic patterns. The process includes forming a polycrystalline inorganic substrate having a flat surface and placing in contact with the flat surface of the substrate a surface having a predetermined microscopic pattern. An acidified aqueous reacting solution is then placed in contact with an edge of the surface having the predetermined microscopic pattern. The solution wicks into the microscopic pattern by capillary action. The reacting solution has an effective amount of a silica source and an effective amount of a surfactant to produce a mesoscopic silica film upon contact of the reacting solution with the flat surface of the polycrystalline inorganic substrate and absorption of the surfactant into the surface. Subsequently an electric field is applied tangentially directed to the surface within the microscopic pattern. The electric field is sufficient to cause electro-osmotic fluid motion and enhanced rates of fossilization by localized Joule heating.,[Ilhan A.

Inductive coupling between capacitors can allow undesired high frequencies to propagate across a filter. This is particularly a concern when the capacitors are oriented in parallel. In the present invention, the inductance cancellation loop is disposed adjacent to one capacitor so that mutual inductance between the capacitors is reduced. The attenuation of the filter at high frequencies is thereby increased. The loop can increase voltage attenuation of an EMI filter by about 20 dB. In another aspect, inductors in the filter are oriented horizontally relative to a circuitboard. Horizontal orientation reduces leakage inductance coupling between the inductors and circuitboard traces, and between the inductor and capacitors, thereby preventing unwanted propagation of high frequencies. Both measures in combination can provide a voltage attenuation increase of 30 dB.",[Shuo Wang][Fred C.

Devices include electroluminescent (EL) colloidal conductive polymer systems that can include EL dyes or other EL materials. Systems can sequester multiple EL components in different colloids in a single emissive layer of an EL device with little or no appreciable energy transfer between colloids. Devices can exhibit tailored emissions over a broad range of wavelengths through mixing of, e.g., red, green and blue PLED colloids. Disclosed methods including incorporation of one or more electroluminescent dyes into a semiconductive EL polymer colloid that can isolate the dyes and prevent energy transfer while retaining individual color emission.",[Christopher F.

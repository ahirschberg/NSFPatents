07332355,20080219,Method and compositions for the detection of protein glycosylation,10990767,20050130235,20050616,"The invention provides methods and compositions for the rapid and sensitive detection of post-translationally modified proteins, and particularly of those with post-translational glycosylations. The methods can be used to detect O-GlcNAc post-translational modifications on proteins on which such modifications were undetectable using other techniques. In one embodiment, the method exploits the ability of an engineered mutant of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase to selectively transfer an unnatural ketone functionality onto O-GlcNAc glycosylated proteins. Once transferred, the ketone moiety serves as a versatile handle for the attachment of biotin, thereby enabling detection of the modified protein. The approach permits the rapid visualization of proteins that are at the limits of detection using traditional methods. Further, the preferred embodiments can be used for detection of certain disease states, such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.",[Linda Hsieh-Wilson][Nelly Khidekel][Hwan-Ching Tai][Sabine Arndt],[California Institute of Technology],"This patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7; 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent No. 60/523,523, filed Nov. 18, 2003, herein incorporated by reference.",20041117,This invention was made in part with government support under the NSF CAREER Award (CHE-0239861) awarded by the National Science Foundation and under the National Institutes of Health Training Grant T32GM07616 awarded by the National Institutes of Health.

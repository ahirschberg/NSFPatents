Such techniques offload specific functionality to a NIC while maintaining the bulk of the protocol processing in the host operating system (“OS”). The resulting protocol implementation allows the application to bypass the protocol processing of the received data. Such can be accomplished this by moving data from the NIC directly to the application through direct memory access (“DMA”) and batch processing the receive headers in the host OS when the host OS is interrupted to perform other work. Batch processing receive headers allows the data path to be separated from the control path. Unlike operating system bypass, however, the operating system still fully manages the network resource and has relevant feedback about traffic and flows. Embodiments of the present disclosure can therefore address the challenges of networks with extreme bandwidth delay products (BWDP).","","[SeaFire Micros, Inc.]","This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser.

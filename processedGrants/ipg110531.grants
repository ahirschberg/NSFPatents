07951334,20110531,Direct write nanolithographic deposition of nucleic acids from nanoscopic tips,12044738,20080269073,20081030,"The use of direct-write nanolithography to generate anchored, nanoscale patterns of nucleic acid on different substrates is described, including electrically conductive and insulating substrates. Modification of nucleic acid, including oligonucleotides, with reactive groups such as thiol groups provides for patterning with use of appropriate scanning probe microscopic tips under appropriate conditions. The reactive groups provide for chemisorption or covalent bonding to the substrate surface. The resulting nucleic acid features, which exhibit good stability, can be hybridized with complementary nucleic acids and probed accordingly with use of, for example, nanoparticles functionalized with nucleic acids. Patterning can be controlled by selection of tip treatment, relative humidity, and nucleic acid structure.",[Chad A. Mirkin][Linette Demers][David S.

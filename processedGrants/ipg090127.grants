In one embodiment, the present invention provides for preparation of homogeneous populations of short fullerene nanotubes by cutting and annealing (reclosing) the nanotube pieces followed by fractionation. The cutting and annealing processes may be carried out on a purified nanotube bucky paper, on felts prior to purification of nanotubes or on any material that contains fullerene nanotubes. In one embodiment, oxidative etching with concentrated nitric acid is employed to cut fullerene nanotubes into shorter lengths.

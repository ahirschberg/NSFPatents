07172676,20070206,System and method for bonding and debonding a workpiece to a manufacturing fixture,10635791,20040026023,20040212,"A system and a method by which workpieces are bonded to and debond from a manufacturing fixture using a radiation responsive adhesive as a bonding agent. The system includes curing the adhesive agent during loading within seconds, and structurally weakens the adhesive bond during unloading within seconds. During the workpiece loading cycle, an adhesive dispenser deposits radiation responsive adhesive on to a load bearing, light transmittive surface, known as gripper pins. The workpiece is subsequently pushed against the locators, and towards the gripper pins causing the adhesive to interpose between workpiece and gripper pins, curing radiant energy is transmitted through the gripper pins and on to the adhesive to cure adhesive and bond the workpiece to the fixture. Therefore, the bond is structurally weakened or debonded in order to remove the workpiece from the fixture after manufacturing.",[Edward C.

07172684,20070206,Methods of and apparatus for making high aspect ratio microelectromechanical structures,10272254,20060283710,20061221,"Various embodiments of the invention provide techniques for forming structures (e.g. HARMS-type structures) via an electrochemical extrusion process. Preferred embodiments perform the extrusion processes via depositions through anodeless conformable contact masks that are initially pressed against substrates that are then progressively pulled away or separated as the depositions thicken. A pattern of deposition may vary over the course of deposition by including more complex relative motion between the mask and the substrate elements. Such complex motion may include rotational components or translational motions having components that are not parallel to an axis of separation. More complex structures may be formed by combining the electrochemical extrusion process with the selective deposition, blanket deposition, planarization, etching, and multi-layer operations of a multi-layer electrochemical fabrication process.",[Adam L.

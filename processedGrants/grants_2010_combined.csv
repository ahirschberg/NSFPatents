OFDM signals have large crest factors, or peak-to-average power ratios (PARs) which lead to power inefficiency in the RF portion of the transmitter. Selected mapping can be used to reduce the PAR of an OFDM signal and is distortionless. A technique is disclosed that links the index of a phase rotation sequence used in selected mapping to the location of pilot tones that are used to estimate the channel. Each pilot tone location-phase sequence selection produces a different PAR value for the time-domain OFDM signal, and the signal with the lowest PAR value is transmitted. The technique is “blind” in that the optimum pilot tone location-phase sequence index is not transmitted as side information. A technique to blindly detect the optimum index at the receiver is also disclosed.",[Ning Chen][Guotong Zhou],[Georgia Tech Research Corporation],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/663,148, filed Mar. 18, 2005.",20060314,"This invention was made with Government support under Agreement No. CCR-0218778 awarded by the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. Army under contract No. DAAD19-01-2-0011.

An expanded downstream channel with multiple parallel capillary blood flow path provides continuing movement of blood past the filters. Lysing is controlled by the size of the filter pores and the duration of adherence of the red blood cells to the pores.

RE041693,20100914,Magnetic switching of charge separation lifetimes in artificial photosynthetic reaction centers,11565506,"","","Excitation of a triad artificial photosynthetic reaction center consisting of a porphyrin (P) convalently linked to a fullerene electron acceptor (C) and a carotenoid secondary donor (C) leads to the formation of a long-lived C-P-Ccharge-separated state via photoinduced electron transfer. This reaction occurs in a frozen organic glass down to at least 8 K. At 77 K, charge recombination of C*-P-Coccurs on the μs time scale, and yields solely the carotenoid triplet state. In the presence of a small (20 mT) static magnetic field, the lifetime of the charge-separated state is increased by 50%. This is ascribed to the effect of the magnetic field on interconversion of the singlet and triplet biradicals. At zero field, the initially formed singlet biradical state is in equilibrium with the three triplet biradical sublevels, and all four states have comparable populations. Decay to the carotenoid triplet only occurs from the three triplet sublevels. In the presence of the field, the S and Tstates are still rapidly interconverting, but the Tand Tstates are isolated from the other two due to the electronic Zeeman interaction, and are not significantly populated. Under these conditions, recombination to the triplet occurs only from T, and the lifetime of the charge-separated state increases. This effect can be used as the basis for a magnetically controlled optical or optoelectronic switch (e.g. AND gate).","[John D. Gust, Jr.][Ana L.

The detectors of the invention rely on base pairing between two oligonucleotide strands, the sensor strand and the blocker strand. In the ‘off’ position of the detector, i.e., in the absence of target, the blocker strand and sensor strand are base-paired. As shown in FIG. , the formation of comparatively rigid, duplex DNA prevents the redox moiety from approaching the electrode surface, thereby suppressing Faradaic currents. When target is added to the system, the target displaces the blocker strand, binds to the sensor strand, liberating the end of the redox-labeled oligonucleotide to produce a flexible element. This, in turn, allows the redox moiety to collide with the electrode surface, producing a readily detectable Faradaic current.",[Yi Xiao][Arica Lubin][Kevin Plaxco],[The Regents of the University of California],"This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser.

In PLN, the particle acts as a “nano-lens,” restricting laser light to the near-field of the particle, and only photodisrupting structures that are nanometers away. This eliminates the need for a tightly focused beam, while still achieving nanoscale ablation resolution. Moreover, the enhanced scattering around the particles reduces the amount of required laser fluence.

The method is based on low-complexity post-FFT signal processing. Minimum mean square error combining of signals is performed for signals received at spatially-distributed receiver elements using adaptive channel estimation and phase tracking. Doppler shifts are modeled as a consequence of motion-induced time compression and dilation. The Doppler rate is assumed constant over one OFDM block but can vary between OFDM blocks. Thus a non-constant Doppler shift is accommodated by the method. Non-uniform Doppler compensation across subchannels is based on adaptive estimation and prediction of the Doppler rate. A single adaptively estimated parameter is used to track the phases of all the carriers and channel estimates are updated on a block by block basis.",[Milica Stojanovic],[Massachusetts Institute of Technology],"",20070911,"This invention was produced utilizing U.S. Government support under Grant Number OCE-0532223, awarded by the National Science Foundation and under Grant Number N00014-05-G0106, awarded by the U.S. Navy.

With frequency domain power adaptation, the transmission power is allocated over the N′ (1≦N′≦N) strongest subcarriers rather than over all possible N subcarriers, where the strongest subcarriers are understood to exhibit the highest channel gains. A substantially optimal N′ can be chosen so that the average bit error rate (BER) is minimized. In the time domain power adaptation technique, transmission power is adapted so that the desired signal strength at the receiver output is maintained at a fixed level. In the combined time and frequency domain adaptation technique, the transmission power is first allocated over the N′ (1≦N′≦N) strongest subcarriers rather than over all possible N subcarriers and then it is adapted so that the desired signal strength at the receiver output is maintained at a fixed level.",[Yeheskel Bar-Ness][Ye-Hoon Lee],[New Jersey Institute of Technology],"This application is a Continuation Application of U.S. application Ser.

07860306,20101228,Method for editing multi-channel images,12705554,20100142804,20100610,"The present invention presents a framework for separating specular and diffuse reflection components in images and videos. Each pixel of the an M-channel input image illuminated by N light sources is linearly transformed into a new color space having (M−N) channels. For an RGB image with one light source, the new color space has two color channels (U,V) that are free of specularities and a third channel (S) that contains both specular and diffuse components. When used with multiple light sources, the transformation may be used to produce a specular invariant image. A diffuse RGB image can be obtained by applying a non-linear partial differential equation to an RGB image to iteratively erode the specular component at each pixel. An optional third dimension of time may be added for processing video images. After the specular and diffuse components are separated, dichromatic editing may be used to independently process the diffuse and the specular components to add or suppress visual effects. The (U,V) channels of images can be used as input to 3-D shape estimation algorithms including shape-from-shading, photometric stereo, binocular and multinocular stereopsis, and structure-from-motion.",[Satya P.

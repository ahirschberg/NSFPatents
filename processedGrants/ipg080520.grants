Introduction of such modifications to a thiophene core affords enhanced thermal stability and volatility, and increased electron affinity versus the unmodified compositions of the prior art. Evaporated films behave as n-type semiconductors, and can be used to fabricate thin film transistors with FET mobilities ˜0.01 cm/Vs—some of the highest reported to date for n-type organic semiconductors ",[Tobin J.

Low temperature methods for making thin films of the compounds on substrate silicon are provided. The methods comprise the step of contacting a precursor having the formula HX—O—XH, wherein X is silicon or carbon with a compound comprising boron or nitrogen in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber or with one or more atomic elements in a molecular beam epitaxial deposition (MBE) chamber. These thin film constructs are useful as components of microelectronic devices, and specifically as gate dielectrics in CMOS devices.",[John Kouvetakis][Ignatius S.

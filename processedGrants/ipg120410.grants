The Fabry-Perot cavity is formed on the sidewall of the fiber and a polymer-metal composite diaphragm is formed on the top of the Fabry-Perot cavity to operate as a pressure transducer. The sensor exhibits a sufficient linearity over the broad pressure range with a high sensitivity. The sensitivity of the sensor may be tuned by controlling the thickness of the diaphragm. The sensor may be used in a wide range of applications, including reliable in vivo low invasive pressure measurements of biological fluids, single sensor systems, as well as integral spatial-division-multiplexing sensor networks. Methods of batch production of uniform device-to-device Fabry-Perot pressure sensors of co-axial and cross-axial configurations are presented.","",[University of Maryland],"This Utility Patent Application is based on U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/230,899 filed on 3 Aug. 2009.",20100803,The U.S. Government has certain rights to the invention.

In this regime, the pulse spectrum is modified by strong self-phase modulation and gain shaping. With large-enough nonlinear phase shift, substantial spectral broadening occurs. The amplified spectrum can therefore be much broader than the spectrum that is obtained with small nonlinear phase shifts. The broader spectrum enables the formation of a shorter pulse, and the bandwidth generated in nonlinear chirped-pulse amplification can in fact be exploited to generate shorter pulses. Ultimately, this allows the generation of pulses shorter than the gain-narrowing limit of a fiber amplifier.","",[Cornell University],"This application claims the benefit, under 35 U.S.C. 119(e), of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/940,076, filed May 25, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",20080527,This invention was made with Government support from the National Science Foundation under Contract No. ESC-0500596.

07823467,20101102,Tactile sensors,12330396,20090165569,20090702,"An electroactive polymer is used to produce a tactile sensor. The electroactive polymer (EAP) includes a sheet of an ion-exchange membrane having opposite surfaces on which are plated gold electrodes. The EAP is formed to have a dome-shape with a plurality of sensing electrodes circumferentially disposed around an outer surface of the dome. A flexible polymer underlying the EAP supports it and prevents a force applied to the tactile sensor from inverting the dome. The sensor electrodes produce separate output signals indicative of different vector components of an applied force acting on the tactile sensor, so that a direction of the force can be determined. Vias provided in the electrodes are electrically coupled to a flexible circuit that conveys the output signals externally from the sensing electrodes for use and further processing. A plurality of the tactile sensors can be formed as an array on an ion-exchange membrane.",[Minoru Taya][Jin Wang][Chunye Xu][Yasuo Kuga],[University of Washington],"This application is based on a prior copending provisional application, Ser.

07825199,20101102,Catalytic processes for the controlled polymerization of free radically (co)polymerizable monomers and functional polymeric systems prepared thereby,09534827,"","","Further improvements have been made in processes for controlled polymerization of free radically (co)polymerizable monomers mediated by a transition metal complex participating in a redox reaction which involves transfer of a radically transferable atom or group to and from an initiator or dormant polymer and the growing active polymer chain ends. Two improvements involve the choice of counterion in the transition metal complex. In one improvement the transition metal is held in close conjunction with a solid support through interaction with a counterion directly attached to the support. This cognition also allows for improvements in catalyst utilization including catalyst recovery and recycle. In another improvement, particularly suitable for controlled polymerization of certain monomers with an expanded range of transition metals, the function of counterion and ligand in the development of the transition metal based catalyst is superseded by use of salt containing a soluble organic counterion. These and other process improvements have been employed to prepare an extended range of novel polymeric materials and novel processes for the preparation of functional polymers including a novel catalytic Atom Transfer Coupling Reaction.",[Krzysztof Matyjaszewski][Scott G.

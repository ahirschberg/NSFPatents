In one embodiment, the invention provides a system with two computers each having a wireless network adapter. The sending node encodes the frames, transmits the frames, determines if the frames were correctly received, retransmits the frames if they were not correctly received, stores the frames that were not retransmitted, and uses the stored frames to generate a secret key. The receiving node receives the encoded frames, determines if the frames were retransmitted, stores at least one of the frames that was not retransmitted, and uses the stored frames to generate the same secret key as the receiving node.","",[University of Massachusetts],"",20081124,"This invention was made with Government support under National Science Foundation grants, contract numbers DMI-0330171 and CNS-0524323.

08204302,20120619,Systems and methods for automatically determining 3-dimensional object information and for controlling a process based on automatically-determined 3-dimensional object information,13047491,20110222777,20110915,"An image containing one or more types of objects to be located is analyzed to locate linear features within the image. The objects have edges having known spatial relationships. The linear features and identified virtual lines are analyzed to find groups of linear features and/or virtual lines that have one of the known spatial relationships. These relationships can include parallel edges, edges that meet at certain angles or angle ranges, the number of lines meeting a vertex and the like. The identified group is compared with projected 2-dimensional representation(s) of the object(s) to determine whether any additional lines appear in the image that are part of the located object. In various exemplary embodiments, two or more hypotheses for how the identified group of linear features maps to the 3-dimensional representation of the object can be generated. The best fitting hypothesis becomes the recognized 3-dimensional shape and orientation for that object.","",[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation],"This patent document is a continuation under 35 U.S.C. &#xA7;120 of application Ser.

The good flow characteristics and strong affinity of the sols to measurement electrodes enable intimate ohmic contact. The measurable, reproducible and proportionate changes in the resistance of the sensors when exposed to trace quantities of oxidative and reducing gases constitute the basis for nanodisk gas sensors. The nanodisk sensors show rapid response and ultra-fast recovery for the detection of nitrogen dioxide and acetic acid vapor. Based on the principles of pattern recognition of the olfactory system, an electronic nose that can “smell” different gaseous species is provided with the multiple nanodisk sensor array. These nanodisk sensors have gas recognition ability, instant response and rapid recovery, compact size and integration with the established microelectronics platform and are well-suited for the on-site and real-time detection of gases.",[Ming Su][Vinayak P.

However, upon confinement into the cylindrical pores, of average diameter 20 nm, of a porous membrane such features of microphase separation do not occur. The microphase separation observed in the bulk polymer is suppressed by strong pinning of the charge carriers due to interactions of the polymer with pore walls together with constrained chain packing and a non-uniform rate of evaporation of the NMP solvent from the pores. This enhances the bulk conductivity after doping by reducing the internal intra-chain disorder introduced by microphase separation.",[Nicholas J. Pinto][Fouad M.

The attenuation of the filter at high frequencies is thereby increased. The loop can increase voltage attenuation of an EMI filter by about 20 dB. In another aspect, inductors in the filter are oriented horizontally relative to a circuitboard. Horizontal orientation reduces leakage inductance coupling between the inductors and circuitboard traces, and between the inductor and capacitors, thereby preventing unwanted propagation of high frequencies.

An optimization framework provides for comparison of the local trends of the 3D estimate and the generic model so that the errors in the 3D estimate are corrected. The 3D estimate is obtained by fusing intermediate 3D reconstructions of pairs of frames of the video sequence after computing the uncertainty of the two frame solutions.

An inventive strategy based on reticulating metal ions and organic carboxylate links into extended networks has been advanced to a point that has allowed the design of porous structures in which pore size and functionality can be varied systematically. MOF-5, a prototype of a new class of porous materials and one that is constructed from octahedral Zn—O—C clusters and benzene links, was used to demonstrate that its 3-D porous system can be functionalized with the organic groups, —Br, —NH2, —OCH, —OCH, —HC, and —HC, and its pore size expanded with the long molecular struts biphenyl, tetrahydropyrene, pyrene, and terphenyl. The ability to direct the formation of the octahedral clusters in the presence of a desired carboxylate link is an essential feature of this strategy, which resulted in the design of an isoreticular (having the same framework topology) series of sixteen well-defined materials whose crystals have open space representing up to 91.1% of the crystal volume, and homogeneous periodic pores that can be incrementally varied from 3.8 to 28.8 angstroms. Unlike the unpredictable nature of zeolite and other molecular sieve syntheses, the deliberate control exercised at the molecular level in the design of these crystals is expected to have tremendous implications on materials properties and future technologies. Indeed, data indicate that members of this series represent the first monocrystalline mesoporous organic/inorganic frameworks, and exhibit the highest capacity for methane storage (155 cm/cmat 36 atm) and the lowest densities (0.41 to 0.21 g/cm) attained to date for any crystalline material at room temperature.",[Omar M.

Such optical fractionation relies on competition between an externally applied force and the moving objects' differing affinities for optical gradient traps. In a reverse fractionation method, objects that are more strongly influenced by the traps tend to become kinetically locked in to the array and are systematically deflected back into an input flow. In a thermal ratcheting method, patterns are spaced to allow particle diffusion, thus providing the opportunity for forward or reverse movement through the patterns. Unlike other sorting techniques, optical fractionation can operate continuously and can be continuously optimized.

The estimated degree of functionality is ca. 1 out of every 20 to 30 carbons in a nanotube bearing a functionality moiety. Such electrochemical reduction processes can be adapted to apply site-selective chemical functionalization of nanotubes. Moreover, when modified with suitable chemical groups, the derivatized nanotubes are chemically compatible with a polymer matrix, allowing transfer of the properties of the nanotubes (such as, mechanical strength or electrical conductivity) to the properties of the composite material as a whole.

The substrate can be manipulated to obtain free-standing alumina templates of high optical quality and substantially flat surfaces PAA films can also be grown this way on patterned and non-planar surfaces. Furthermore, under certain conditions the resulting PAA is missing the barrier layer (partially or completely) and the bottom of the pores can be readily accessed electrically. The resultant film can be used as a template for forming an array of nanowires wherein the nanowires are deposited electrochemically into the pores of the template. By patterning the electrically conducting adhesion layer, pores in different areas of the template can be addressed independently, and can be filled electrochemically by different materials.

Such a process overcomes the fundamental bandwidth-delay constraint in optics, and can generate arbitrarily small group velocities for light pulses with a given bandwidth, without the use of any coherent or resonant light-matter interactions. This is accomplished only by small refractive index modulations performed at moderate speeds and has applications ranging from quantum communications and computing to coherent all-optical memory devices. A complete time reversal and/or temporal/spectral compression and expansion operation on any electromagnetic field is accomplished using only small refractive index modulations and linear optical elements.

The surface sensitivity is increased as a function of incidence or bevel angle. The tapered waveguide improves the efficiency of the optical coupling both into the waveguide from an FTIR spectrometer, and out of the waveguide onto a small-area IR detector. The tapering makes it possible to dispense with using an IR microscope couple light through the waveguide, enabling efficient coupling with a detector directly coupled to an immersion lens. This optical arrangement makes such thin supported waveguides more useful as sensors, because they can be made quite long (e.g. 50 mm) and mounted horizontally. Furthermore, even with a 20-μm×1-mm cross section, sufficient throughput is obtained to give signal/noise ratios in excess of 1000 over most of the 1000–5000 cm-range, with just 2 min of scanning at 8 cm-resolution.",[Susan E.

A cognitive radio engine implements three algorithms; a wireless channel genetic algorithm (WCGA), a cognitive system monitor (CSM) and a wireless system genetic algorithm (WSGA). A chaotic search with controllable boundaries allows the cognitive radio engine to seek out and discover unique solutions efficiently. By being able to control the search space by limiting the number of generations, crossover rates, mutation rates, fitness evaluations, etc., the cognitive system can ensure legal and regulatory compliance as well as efficient searches. The versatility of the cognitive process can be applied to any adaptive radio. The cognitive system defines the radio chromosome, where each gene represents a radio parameter such as transmit power, frequency, modulation, etc. The adaptation process of the WSGA is performed on the chromosomes to develop new values for each gene, which is then used to adapt the radio settings.",[Christian J.

These structures were made by initially using direct write nanolithography to pattern the etch resist, 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA), on Au/Ti/SiO/Si substrates and then wet chemical etching to remove the exposed gold. These are the smallest Au structures prepared by a wet chemical etching strategy. Also, Dip-Pen Nanolithography (DPN) has been used to generate resist layers on Au, Ag, and Pd that when combined with wet chemical etching can lead to nanostructures with deliberately designed shapes and sizes. Monolayers of mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHA) or octadecanethiol (ODT), patterned by DPN, were explored as etch resists. They work comparably well on Au and Ag, but ODT is the superior material for Pd. MHA seems to attract the FeCletchant and results in nonuniform etching of the underlying Pd substrate. Dots, lines, triangles and circles, ranging in size from sub-100 to several hundred nm have been fabricated on these substrates.

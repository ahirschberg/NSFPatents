The magnetic hysteresis loop of this new magnetic nitride is close to the perfect ideal square with the same value of saturation magnetization, remnant magnetization, and magnetization right before switching (domain reversal).

07354563,20080408,Method for purification of as-produced fullerene nanotubes,11507960,20080063588,20080313,"This invention relates generally to a fullerene nanotube purification process and more particularly to a purification process that comprises heating the fullerene nanotube-containing felt under oxidizing conditions to remove the amorphous carbon deposits and other contaminating materials. In a preferred mode of this purification procedure, the felt is heated in an aqueous solution of an inorganic oxidant, such as nitric acid, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid, or a potassium permanganate. Preferably, fullerene nanotube-containing felts are refluxed in an aqueous solution of an oxidizing acid at a concentration high enough to etch away amorphous carbon deposits within a practical time frame, but not so high that the fullerene nanotube material will be etched to a significant degree. When material having a high proportion of fullerene nanotubes is purified, the preparation produced will be enriched in fullerene nanotubes, so that the fullerene nanotubes are substantially free of other material.",[Richard E.

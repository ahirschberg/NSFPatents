07421910,20080909,Strain sensitive coax cable sensors for monitoring structures,11245480,20060086197,20060427,"The invention provides increased structural monitoring systems that have sensitive continuous coaxial cable sensors. A preferred embodiment sensor cable of the invention includes an inner conductor, a dielectric jacket, and an outer conductor that is configured to passively deform responsively to strain in an associated structure. The deformation can be aided by the physical structure of the dielectric jacket, the outer conductor, or a combination of both. The deformation translates strain into a measurable change in a reflection coefficient associated with the outer conductor.",[Genda Chen][James L.

A substrate is provided with at least two anchors secured thereto in spaced relationship. Fibroblast cells are provided on the substrate in the absence of a synthetic matrix, where at least some of the cells are in contact with the anchors. The cells are cultured in vitro under conditions to allow the cells to self-organize and become confluent between the anchors, where the anchors are receptive to the cells and allow the cells to attach thereto while permitting the cells to detach from the substrate to form a three-dimensional connective tissue construct.",[Paul E.

07423265,20080909,Near-field aperture having a fractal iterate shape,11666063,20080088903,20080417,"Near-field electromagnetic devices having an opaque metallic screen with a fractal iterate aperture are provided. More specifically, the aperture is obtained by application of a self-similar replacement rule to an initial shape two or more times. Alternatively, the aperture can be obtained by application of a self-similar replacement rule one or more times to an initial C-shape. Such apertures tend to have multiple transmission resonances due to their multiple length scales. Fractal iterate apertures can provide enhanced transmission and improved spatial resolution simultaneously. Enormous improvement in transmission efficiency is possible. In one example, a checkerboard fractal iterate aperture provides 10more intensity gain than a square aperture having the same spatial resolution. Efficient transmission for fractal iterate apertures having spatial resolution of Î»/20 is also shown. The effect of screen thickness and composition can be included in detailed designs, but do not alter the basic advantages of improved transmission and spatial resolution provided by the invention.",[Joseph A.

The k-space sampling table is produced using a spatio-temporal model of the beating heart, time sequential sampling theory and a known number of parallel receive channels (coils). The imaging pulse sequence is repeated to play out the phase encodings in the order listed in the k-space sampling schedule and the k-space data sets acquired through the parallel receive channels are combined and used to reconstruct a sequence of images. The method is an improved process for dynamic MRI, designed to overcome the limitations of current MRI systems in imaging dynamic phenomena and produces highly accurate motion movies of the structure, function, perfusion and viability of various anatomical regions in MRI subjects such as the beating heart, flow of contrast agents in blood vessels, brain excitation, or joint movement.",[Behzad Sharif][Yoram Bresler][Nitin Aggarwal],[The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois],"",20070406,This invention was made with government support under contract Number BES02-01876 awarded by the National Science Foundation.

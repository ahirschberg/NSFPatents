07188473,20070313,Shape memory alloy actuator system using segmented binary control,11114504,"","","An architecture shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators is presented called Segmented Binary Control (SBC). Instead of controlling the phase transition of the entire SMA wire as a single plant, we divide the SMA wire into many segments, each of which is controlled separately as an ON-OFF finite-state process. SBC produces a displacement as the addition of small displacements generated by the individual segments. Furthermore, the segmented architecture of SMA wires is extended to a multi-axis actuator array by arranging them in a two-dimensional array, so that the multi-axis control may be streamlined and coordinated. Moreover, the 2-D segmentation can be so designed that coordinated gross motion as well as independent fine movements may be generated with minimum complexity and minimum control loops.",[Harry Haruhiko Asada][Kyu-Jin Cho][Brian Selden],[],"This application claims the benefit of Provisional Patent Application Ser.

The techniques may further include applying a permutation matrix to the Nblocks, generating a space-time block coded matrix having Nrows that are communicated through a wireless communication medium.

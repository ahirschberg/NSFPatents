<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">One-dimensional nanostructures having uniform diameters of less than approximately 200 nm. These inventive nanostructures, which we refer to as &ldquo;nanowires&rdquo;, include single-crystalline homostructures as well as heterostructures of at least two single-crystalline materials having different chemical compositions. Because single-crystalline materials are used to form the heterostructure, the resultant heterostructure will be single-crystalline as well. The nanowire heterostructures are generally based on a semiconducting wire wherein the doping and composition are controlled in either the longitudinal or radial directions, or in both directions, to yield a wire that comprises different materials. Examples of resulting nanowire heterostructures include a longitudinal heterostructure nanowire (LOHN) and a coaxial heterostructure nanowire (COHN). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains generally to nanostructures, and more particularly to a substantially crystalline nanowire structure having a diameter along the wire axis which varies by less than approximately 10% over a section exhibiting the maximum change in diameter, and which has a diameter of less than approximately 200 nm. The nanowire structure can be formed as a homostructure, as a heterostructure, and as combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The ability to efficiently convert energy between different forms (e.g., thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> creates the infrastructure of any modern economy and is one of the most recognizable symbols of advances in science and engineering. Optoelectronics, for example, deals with the conversion between optical and electronic forms, which has laid the foundation for many aspects of modern information technology. Conversion between thermal energy and electrical power is the hallmark of the energy economy, where even marginal improvements in efficiency and conversion methods can have enormous impact on both monetary savings, energy reserves, and the environment. Similarly, electromechanical energy conversion lies at the heart of many modern machines and sensors, which have found widespread use in technology. Given its importance, it is natural to ask whether nanoscale science and engineering can play any role in energy conversion. Clearly, in view of the continuing quest for miniaturization and increased efficiency of devices, nanoscale devices can play a role in energy conversion. Accordingly, there is a need for a broad spectrum of high performance energy conversion devices based on one-dimensional inorganic nanostructures or nanowires. The present invention satisfies that need, as well as others, and overcomes deficiencies inherent in conventional devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains generally to nanostructures which are substantially crystalline, and more particularly to one-dimensional nanostructures having a diameter along the longitudinal axis which does not vary by more than approximately 10% over the section exhibiting the maximum change in diameter, and having a diameter of less than approximately 200 nm at the point of maximum diameter. These inventive nanostructures, which we refer to as &ldquo;nanowires&rdquo;, preferably comprise substantially monocrystalline homostructures, as well as heterostructures of at least one substantially crystalline material and one other material where an interface or junction is formed therebetween. Heterostructures according to the present invention can also include combinations of homostructures and heterostructures. In the event that substantially crystalline materials are used to form the heterostructure, the resultant heterostructure will be substantially crystalline as well. Additionally, nanowires according to the invention can have various cross-sectional shapes, including, but not limited, to circular, square, rectangular and hexagonal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Heterostructures can be formed with any number of segments, both longitudinally and coaxially, where adjacent segments are substantially crystalline or where a substantially crystalline segment is adjacent to a material which is not substantially crystalline. Many of the nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention are generally based on a semiconducting wire wherein the doping and composition are controlled in either the longitudinal or radial directions, or in both directions, to yield a wire that comprises different materials. Segments of heterostructures can be various materials, including, for example, semiconductor materials which are doped or intrinsic and arranged to form a variety of semiconductor devices with junctions such as pn, pnp, npn, pin, pip and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> By way of further example, according to an aspect of the invention, the nanowire could comprise different materials when viewed longitudinally, such as would be the case with alternating or periodic segments of different materials or multi-segmented nanowires where at least two of the segments comprise different materials. We refer to this configuration as a longitudinal heterostructure nanowire (LOHN). An example would be a LOHN where adjacent segments have different chemical compositions such as Si and SiGe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, the nanowire would be a coaxial-type structure, comprising a core of a first material surrounded by a jacket of a second material. We refer to this configuration as a coaxial heterostructure nanowire (COHN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The junctions between the compositionally substantially crystalline materials defining nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention typically exhibit a high degree of sharpness. For example, in accordance with the present invention, the interface between these materials can be made as sharp as approximately one atomic layer to approximately 20 nm. However, since heterostructures according to the present invention can comprise multiple segments either longitudinally, coaxially, or both, it is also possible to form heterostructures where some junctions exhibit a high degree of sharpness and others do not depending upon the particular application and need. Furthermore, not only can the composition of the materials forming adjacent segments be sharp or gradual, but by controlling the doping of materials forming segments of the heterostructure, it is possible to have sharp or gradual dopant transition between segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments of the present invention, the nanostructures of this invention expressly exclude structures comprising carbon nanotubes and/or structures comprising what are commonly referred to as &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; or &ldquo;nano-whiskers&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that various configurations can be achieved using the foregoing inventive structures, some of which have been previously described. By way of further example, and not of limitation, these configurations can include single and multiple junction LOHNs, single and multiple junction COHNs, combinations of LOHN and COHN structures, two-terminal configurations, N&gt;2 terminal configurations, combinations of heterostructures and homostructures, homostructures with one or more electrodes (which would also be an overall heterostructure), heterostructures with one or more electrodes, homostructures with insulators, heterostructures with insulators, and the like. It will also be appreciated that the interface between a nanowire and a terminal constitutes a heterojunction. A variety of devices can be fabricated using these structures and configurations, including, but not limited to, phonon bandgap devices, quantum dots that confine electrons in specific areas, thermoelectric devices (e.g., solid state refrigerators and engines), photonic devices (e.g., nanolasers), nanoelectromechanical (MEM) devices (electromechanical actuators and sensors), energy conversion devices of various forms including for example, light to mechanical energy or thermal energy to light, and other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a process for fabricating nanowires has been developed. In particular, this aspect of the invention includes a process for making a population of nanowire heterostructures with a substantially monodisperse distribution of diameters if the distribution of diameters within the population is less than or equal to approximately 50% rms, more preferably less than or equal to 20% rms, and most preferably less than 10% rms. A further aspect of the invention comprises a process for forming populations of nanowires with a substantially monodisperse distribution of lengths. A population of nanowires is considered to have a monodisperse distribution of lengths in the distribution of lengths within the population is less than or equal to 20% rms, more preferably less than or equal to 10% rms, more preferably less than or equal to 5% rms, and most preferably less than 1%. A further aspect of the invention comprises a design for nanowires that permits batch fabrication in large quantities. Another aspect of the invention includes a laser device that can be formed from either a heterostructure or a homogeneous structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further objects and advantages of the invention will be brought out in the following portions of the specification, wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing preferred embodiments of the invention without placing limitations thereon.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> 1. Introduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a family of nanostructures which we refer to as &ldquo;nanowires&rdquo;. Nanowires in accordance with the present invention generally comprise heterostructures of at least one substantially crystalline material and one other compositionally different material where an interface or junction is formed therebetween. However, nanowire heterostructures according to the invention can also include heterostructures where the materials are the same but have different crystalline orientations. Furthermore, the surface of a nanowire according to the present invention (whether a homostructure or a heterostructure) could be functionalized to capture specific chemical or biological species. In the event that substantially crystalline materials are used to form the heterostructure, it will be appreciated that the resultant heterostructure will be substantially crystalline as well. Preferably at least one of the materials in the heterostructure is substantially monocrystalline. In this regard, we refer to a material as being substantially crystalline if the material exhibits long range ordering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A nanowire according to the present invention preferably has a diameter of less than approximately 200 nm at its maximum point, and the diameter along the longitudinal axis preferably varies by less than approximately 10% over the section exhibiting the maximum change in diameter. Additionally, nanowires according to the invention can have various cross-sectional shapes, including, but not limited, to circular, square, rectangular and hexagonal. For example, ZnO nanowires have a hexagonal cross-section, SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>nanowires have a rectangular cross-section, PbSe nanowires have a square cross-section, and Si or Ge nanowires have a circular cross-section. In each case, the term &ldquo;diameter&rdquo; is intended to refer to the effective diameter, as defined by the average of the major and minor axis of the cross-section of the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the nanowire materials of the present invention are fundamentally different from those commonly referred to as semiconductor &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; formed by using basic VLS growth techniques. It is well understood that the mechanism responsible for the growth of these &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; is limited to the creation of semiconductor wires of a diameter greater than approximately 1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention describe a method of modifying VLS growth in which the catalyst size is arrested to form nanowires with diameters from approximately 1 nm to approximately 200 nm. Due to the quantum confinement effects, these structures are fundamentally different than whiskers, which are larger than the Bohr exciton radius of the bulk semiconductors from which they are formed, and therefore represent a unique composition of matter. The physical, optical, and electronic properties of these materials are fundamentally different than would be achieved if the characteristics of whiskers were simply extrapolated toward far smaller sizes. In the nanowire size range these materials represent a new form of matter, different than bulk material in ways which are unique and non-obvious. The importance of the distinction between nanowires and traditional &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; should be appreciated. Whiskers operate as small &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; semiconductor wires and thereby provide the same functionality as wires formed by standard photolithographic semiconductor processing techniques. The nanowires described within the present invention, however, display both electronic and optical properties that are fundamentally different than the bulk material from which they are formed, and are characteristically different than that of &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention include configurations where two or more substantially monocrystalline materials are spatially arranged in such a manner that quantum confinement effects are exploited in new and unique ways. This approach is expected to not only open the road to scientific discoveries, but also offer the promising prospects of dramatically changing energy conversion technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments of the invention fabrication is facilitated with the well known vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) chemical synthesis process which will be described herein. The basic (unmodified) VLS process is also described in detail in the following publications which are incorporated herein by reference: Wagner, R. S., &ldquo;VLS Mechanism of Crystal Growth&rdquo;, Whisker Technology, pp. 47-119 (1970); Wagner et al., &ldquo;Vapor-Liquid-Solid Mechanism of Single Crystal Growth&rdquo;, Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 4., No. 5, pp. 89-90 (1964); and Givargizov, E., &ldquo;Fundamental Aspects of VLS Growth&rdquo;, Journal of Crystal Growth, Vol. 31, pp. 20-30 (1975). Using the basic (unmodified) VLS, it is possible to grow monocrystalline nanowires of a wide variety of semiconducting materials (e.g., Si, Ge, ZnO, etc.) with an average diameter greater than approximately 1 &mgr;m and a diameter distribution greater than 50% and lengths up to or exceeding many millimeters. The present invention provides methods of forming nanowires structures with a diameter less than approximately 200 nm and preferably in the range of approximately 5 nm to approximately 50 nm, with lengths in the range of approximately 100 nm to approximately 100 &mgr;m, preferably in the range between approximately 1 &mgr;m to approximately 20 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if the diameter of semiconducting nanowires is reduced to the range of approximately 5 nm to approximately 50 nm, quantum confinement of electrons and holes allows tailoring of the electronic band structure of the entire nanowire or of one or more domains within the nanowire. Such confinement can also strongly influence photon and/or phonon transport in nanowires because both the photon and/or phonon spectra and lifetimes can be significantly modified. The importance of surface energy and growth anisotropy in nanowire synthesis also affords the possibility of synthesizing phases that are stable in nanowire form but metastable in the bulk or as thin films. Hence, materials with unique phases and properties can be created in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> 2. Nanowire Heterostructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an aspect of the present invention comprises the following two nanowire heterostructures as building blocks for other heterostructures and devices: (i) a coaxial heterostructure nanowire (COHN) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; and (ii) a longitudinal heterostructure nanowire (LOHN) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, COHN <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a substantially crystalline core <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> surrounded by a sheath <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of a compositionally different material where a junction <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed therebetween. Sheath <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be substantially crystalline or amorphous, a polymer, semiconductor, oxide or the like. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, LOHN <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises at least one segment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a substantially crystalline material adjacent to at least one other segment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a compositionally different material where a junction <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Heterostructures according to the present invention can be formed with any number of segments, both longitudinally and coaxially, and in various configurations, some of which are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a superlattice of additional segments <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby illustrating that a heterostructure is not limited to only two adjacent segments. It will be appreciated, however, that at least two of the segments should comprise compositionally different materials in order to be a heterostructure. By &ldquo;compositionally different&rdquo; we mean (i) the materials have different chemical compositions (whether intrinsic or doped) or (ii) the materials have different crystal directions (e.g., the same materials but different crystal orientation). The nanowire heterostructure could comprise compositionally different materials when viewed longitudinally, such as would be the case with alternating or periodic segments of different materials or multi-segmented nanowires where at least two of the segments comprise different materials. An example of a LOHN where adjacent segments have different compositions would be a segment of Si adjacent to a segment SiGe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrate various examples of COHNs having additional segments. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a core <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a sheath comprising first and second segments <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a core comprising first and second segments <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, respectively, surrounded by a sheath <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> having a core comprising first and second core segments <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, respectively, and a sheath comprising first and second sheath segments <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a COHN <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> having a core comprising a superlattice of segments <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> surrounded by a sheath <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Note that the sheath can be crystalline or amorphous, and can include materials such as polymers, semiconductors, oxides, and the like. In addition, COHNs can have multiple sheath layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, COHNs can be formed by partially coating a single-segment nanowire or a LOHN. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having a single-segment core <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which is only partially surrounded by a sheath <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> having a LOHN core comprising segments <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> wherein the core is only partially surrounded by sheath <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the cores could comprise superlattices with a partial sheath. Note also that the sheath portion could be segmented as well and, further, that the segments of the sheath could be adjacent or spaced-apart. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these sheath configurations are achieved using conventional masking techniques, and that these configurations represent just a few of the possible configurations based on the nanowire structures described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that segments of heterostructures can comprise various materials, including, for example, semiconductor materials which are doped or undoped (i.e. pure intrinsic semiconductors) and arranged to form a variety of semiconductor devices with junctions such as pn, pnp, npn, pin, pip and so forth. In certain embodiments the materials can be doped in a conventional manner. For example, conventional dopants such as B, Ph, As, In and Al can be used. Both the nanowire and the dopant materials can be selected from Groups II, III, IV, V, VI, etc. and can include quaternaries and tertiaries, as well as oxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> One of the inventive aspects of the present invention is that while it is commonly believed that such nanostructures cannot be &ldquo;homogeneously doped&rdquo; (i.e. doped such that dopant molecules are dispersed in a microscopically homogeneous manner), the materials of the present invention operate as if homogeneous doping was performed, because they conduct as would be expected if dopant molecules had been homogeneously distributed throughout the material. This result is unexpected since the high temperature and small size of the nanowires would suggest that all dopant molecules would be annealed to the surface of the wires, where they would behave in the manner of trap sites rather than replicating the electronic properties of a &ldquo;homogeneously doped&rdquo; semiconductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In a number of embodiments, the present invention contemplates nanowire heterostructures comprising one or more doped semiconductors selected from a group that includes, but is not limited to, type II-VI semiconductor, type III-V semiconductor, type II-IV semiconductor, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Essentially any semiconductor material and its alloys can be used as adjacent materials in a nanowire heterostructure according to the present invention. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a nanowire heterostructure <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which is a pn junction device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a nanowire heterostructure <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which is a pnp, npn, pin, pip, etc. junction device. Many of the nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention are generally based on a semiconducting wire wherein the doping and composition are controlled in either the longitudinal or radial directions, or in both directions, to yield a wire that comprises compositionally different materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, in a heterostructure according to the present invention at least one of the segments comprises a material that is substantially crystalline, particularly at its core. It will be appreciated that oxides on a nanowire surface can be amorphous without destroying the substantially crystalline ordering of the nanowire core. In addition, the nanocrystals can include defects, substitutions of atoms, certain dislocations, and combinations thereof, without defeating substantial long-range ordering. In general, insofar as the material exhibits substantial long-range ordering (e.g. ordering over a distance of approximately 100 nm, it will be regarded as substantially crystalline and/or substantially monocrystalline. Insofar as the material exhibits long-range ordering, then the material is considered to be substantially crystalline according to the present invention. Preferably, at least the inner 20% of the material from the cross-sectional center outward is substantially monocrystalline. In the case of silicon nanowires, epitaxial growth is preferred (i.e., monocrystalline growth for silicon on a silicon wafer by precipitating silicon from a vapor). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The diameter of a nanowire according to the present invention is typically less than approximately 200 nm at the maximum point of diameter and preferably in the range from approximately 5 nm to approximately 50 nm. In addition, the variation in diameter across an ensemble of wires synthesized in the same process is relatively sharp, such that the distribution of diameters is typically less than approximately 50%, preferably less than approximately 20%, more preferably less than approximately 10%. In cases where the cross-section of the nanowire is not circular, the term &ldquo;diameter&rdquo; in this context refers to the average of the lengths of the major and minor axis of the cross-section of the nanowire, with the plane being normal to the longitudinal axis of the nanowire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, nanowires according to the present invention typically exhibit a high uniformity in diameter from end to end. More particularly, over a section of the nanowire that shows the maximum change in diameter would preferably not exceed approximately 10%, more preferably it would not exceed approximately 5%, and most preferably it would not exceed approximately 5%. The change in diameter may be considered to be given by (d<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&minus;d<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight>)/d<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight>). It should be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that the ends of the nanowire will contain a sharp change in diameter, possibly even exhibiting an infinite slope, wherein the measure described above is considered to be at a location away from the ends of the nanowires. The measurement preferably being made at a location separated from an end by at least 5%, and more preferably at least 10%, of the total length of the wire. In certain embodiments, the change in diameter is evaluated over a length of the nanowire that ranges from approximately 1%, preferably up to approximately 25%, more preferably up to approximately 75%, and most preferably up to approximately 90% of the total length of the nanowire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The junctions between the compositionally different substantially crystalline materials defining nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention typically exhibit a high degree of sharpness. For example, in accordance with the present invention, the transition zone between these materials can be made as sharp as approximately one atomic layer to the total lateral length of the nanowire (i.e. a continuously varying alloy along the length of the wire). Typically, the transition should be relatively sharp, however, the transition may span between a single atomic layer and approximately 50 nm, and more preferably between a single atomic layer and approximately 20 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of evaluating the length of a transition (transition zone) in the case of a LOHN, the beginning of the transition zone transitioning from a first material to a second material can be defined as a point along the longitudinal axis moving from the first material to the second material wherein the deviation in material composition (e.g. dopant concentration and/or base material composition) of the first material is less than approximately 20%, more preferably less than approximately 10%, more preferably less than approximately 5%, and most preferably less than approximately 1%. The end of the transition zone transitioning from the first material to the second material can be defined as the point along the longitudinal axis moving from the first material to the second material where the deviation in material composition of the nanowire at that point as compared to the composition (e.g. dopant concentration and/or base material concentration) of the second material is less than approximately 20%, more preferably less than approximately 10%, more preferably less than approximately 5%, and most preferably less than approximately 1%. In the case of a COHN, the beginning and end of the transition zone are measured as a function of composition radially from the center of the nanowire. In either case, the transition zone should represent a change from a substantially crystalline and preferably substantially monocrystalline material to a compositionally different material. It should be appreciated, however, that since heterostructures according to the present invention can comprise multiple segments either longitudinally, coaxially, or both. It should also be appreciated that it is also possible to form heterostructures in which some junctions exhibit a high degree of sharpness while others do not, as depends upon the specific application and requirements. Furthermore, not only can the composition of the materials forming adjacent segments be sharp or gradual, but by controlling the doping of materials forming segments of the heterostructure, it is possible to have sharp or gradual dopant transitions between segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, note that the band structure of materials <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in COHNs can be so chosen that one can achieve modulation doping, whereby the dopant atoms would reside in the sheath <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the carriers would be generally confined in the core <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This will provide very high electron mobility due to reduced dopant and interface scattering that has been observed in uncoated nanowires. This is the one-dimensional (1-D) version of the two-dimensional (2-D) electron gas that is created by semiconductor 2-D heterostructures. Such a 1-D electron gas can then utilized, for example, in high-performance thermoelectric and photonic devices where electron mobility plays an important role. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> 3. Nanowire Synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Nanostructures with reduced dimensionality such as nanowires are both fundamentally interesting and technologically important. Yet, nanowire synthesis has remained an enormous challenge for material scientists because of the difficulty with one-dimensional control. Carbon nanotubes can also be used as templates to prepare nanorods of different compositions. There are also efforts using membrane templates to make metal or semiconducting nanorods. However, these nanorods are mostly polycrystalline, which partly limit their potential usefulness. In order to gain well-defined structure-property correlation for these 1D systems, it was necessary to develop general and predictive methodology for the synthesis of single crystalline nanowires with uniform size and aspect ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> 3.1 VLS Mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The nanowires and nanowire heterostructures of the present invention can be synthesized by a wide variety of methods. In preferred embodiments, however, the nanowires are synthesized utilizing a modified vapor liquid solid (VLS) procedure. This process is described in detail in the examples provided herein, which are provided by way of example and not of limitation, wherein a number of modifications of the exemplified process are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the above synthetic approaches, the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process is a very powerful method to chemically synthesize single-crystalline 1D nanomaterials. This process, which has been previously used to produce micron sized whiskers and recently nanowires with various compositions, involves dissolving the gas reactants in nanosized catalytic liquid followed by one-dimensional growth of single-crystalline nanowhiskers. The catalyst can be easily chosen based on the analysis of the equilibrium phase diagrams. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Referring to the schematic diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, an example of the growth process of an Si nanowire on an Si (111) substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated. In this example, SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is utilized as the Si vapor source and Au nanoclusters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as catalysts. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is preferably carried out at approximately 600&deg; C. to approximately 800&deg; C. At this temperature, the Au nanoclusters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> form a liquid alloy with Si and spontaneously break up into nanometer sized droplets <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of Au&mdash;Si alloy. Next, the Si species continuously deposit into Au&mdash;Si alloy droplets where growth of the Si nanowire <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is initiated upon supersaturation of the gold by the silicon. The process continues until nanowire <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> achieves the desired length. Nanowires have been successfully prepared from Si, Ge and ZnO utilizing this mechanism in a conventional chemical vapor transport/deposition (CVT/CVD) system. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies indicate that the inorganic nanowires are single crystalline with a preferred growth direction (e.g. &lsqb;111&rsqb; for Ge). The diameter of these nanowires can be precisely controlled at diameters less than approximately 200 nm. Preferably the diameters are controlled at diameters less than approximately 100 nm, more preferably less than approximately 50 nm, and most preferably less than approximately 25 nm, 15 nm, or 10 nm. By using catalyst nanoclusters (e.g. Au, Co, Ni, Fe) with a monodisperse diameter distribution and with different sizes (e.g. from approximately 1 nm to approximately 100 nm, more typically from approximately 5 nm to approximately 100 nm), such nanowires can readily be produced (e.g. having a diameter ranging from approximately 5 nm to approximately 200 nm, and most typically from approximately 10 nm to approximately 50 nm). These catalysts can be either dispersed on a Si substrate (e.g. an Si substrate or a substrate comprising other desired material or materials) or on top of a mesoporous silica film (e.g. an Si film or alternative films comprising other desired material or materials). It was also found that the aspect ratio of the nanowires can be varied from approximately 1.5 or 2 to on the order of 1,000,000 and more typically from appromximately 100 to approximately 100,000 by using different growth times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The position of the nanowires on substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be controlled through any convenient method of patterning the catalyst. Such methods include, but are not limited to various sputtering and controlled deposition techniques, various lithographic masking and/or etching techniques, along with additional methods and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, nanowire arrays can be fabricated by lithographically patterning a thin film catalyst on the substrate and heating the film until it melts into a plurality of droplets where each droplet acts as the catalyst for an individual nanowire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the substrate material is not limited to Si, or even a single material, and for example, insulators such as sapphire can be used as a substrate. Generally any material that can be made soluble or suspended in an appropriate catalyst may be utilized in the formation of a nanowire by the methods of the present invention. Such materials include, but are not limited to Group II, III, IV, V, and VI materials or alloys thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The metal catalyst can be a material other than Au as well, and also need not be limited to a single material (e.g. the use of various alloy materials is contemplated). By way of example, GaN nanowires can be fabricated on a C-sapphire substrate using an Ni catalyst and a vapor of Ga and NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Here, preferred growth would be in the (002) direction. Furthermore, the nanowire can be doped with Mn by using a mixture of MnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and C. Similarly, a Ga(Co)N nanowire can be grown by using an Ni catalyst, C-sapphire substrate and Ga&plus;NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rarr;Co doping by Co<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus;C mixture. A GaN nanowire can also be grown by using a Ni catalyst, C-sapphire substrate and Ga<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&plus;C mixture. Alloyed Ga&mdash;N&mdash;Zn&mdash;O nanowires can be grown by using an Ni catalyst, C-sapphire substrate and Ga&plus;NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rarr;layer by ZnO&plus;C mixture. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> High temperature TEM was used to observe the growth of a Ge nanowire in situ. Here, small numbers of Ge particles were dispersed on TEM grids together with Au nanoclusters and served as the Ge vapor source when the sample stage was heated in the vacuum chamber. It was observed that the melting of Au clusters initiated after the Ge&mdash;Au alloy formation. This was followed by an increase of the liquid droplet size during the Ge vapor condensation process. When the droplet supersaturates with the Ge component, the Ge nanowire spits out (is ejected) from the alloy droplet and starts to grow. The real-time observation of the nanowire growth directly mirrors the mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Based on these observations, several aspects of nanowire growth control are immediately apparent: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> (1) Inorganic nanowires with different compositions (e.g. Si, Ge, GaAs, CdSe, GaN, AIN, Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, ZnO, and others) can be synthesized by using suitable metal catalysts, gas precursors and reaction temperatures. The latter can be determined by examining the binary or ternary phase diagram </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> (2) Conventional dopants such as B, Ph, As, In and Al can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> (3) Materials can be selected from types III-V, II-VI, II-IV, etc. and can include quaternaries and tertiaries, as well as oxides. Essentially any semiconductor material and its alloys can be used as adjacent materials in a nanowire heterostructure according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> (4) To the first order approximation, the nanowire diameter is determined by the catalyst size. Smaller nanoclusters will yield thinner nanowires. This has also been successfully demonstrated in the GaP and Si nanowire system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Synthesis methods of the present invention share some features of surfactant-mediated epitaxial growth in that the mediating material (in the form of a molten metal nanoparticle or a monolayer, respectively) catalyzes the epitaxial growth by inhibiting the reconstruction of the semiconductor growth surface. Since there is no stable reconstruction that must be continually disassembled and reestablished, nanowire growth can occur selectively and at lower temperature than conventional epitaxial growth. The lower temperatures offer the opportunity to access new phases, to produce sharper interfaces, and to inhibit morphological evolution of the nanowire material during the growth process (e.g., Rayleigh breakup). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> 3.2 Altered Phase Equilibria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The nanowire geometry provides the opportunity to synthesize phases not stable in bulk or thin-film form. As a result of the high surface-to-volume ratio, surface energy contributes more strongly to the total free energy terms in the free energy, especially for crystalline phases with highly anisotropic surface energies. For example, the equilibrium phase boundary between zincblende (cubic) and wurtzite (hexagonal) polytypes of III-V and II-VI semiconductors will shift in pressure and temperature relative to the bulk equilibrium boundary. For example, comparing a &lt;111&gt; oriented zincblende nanowire to a &lt;0001&gt; oriented wurtzite nanowire of the same composition, a cylindrical wurtzite nanowire will more closely approximate the equilibrium (Wulff) shape, exposing low surface-energy prismatic facets. The wurtzite phase has indeed been observed as the preferred phase of GaAs in previous research on nanowire synthesis by OMCVD. In addition, epitaxial relationship between the substrates and nanowires could also be utilized to trap metastable phases in nanowire forms. This strategy has been successfully used in thin film growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> 3.3 Heteroepitaxy in Nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor heterostructures enable confinement of electrons and holes, guiding of light and selective doping, yet these interfaces must be dislocation-free if they reside in active regions of the device. The range of materials that can be grown by coherent epitaxy on a given substrate, and to a required thickness, is greatly limited by the lattice misfit. For a given lattice misfit, the equilibrium critical thickness for coherent epitaxy may be estimated with knowledge of the elastic properties of the film and the core energy and crystallography of a misfit dislocation (e.g., in-plane edge component of the burgers vector). Although coherent heteroepitaxial films can be grown well beyond the equilibrium critical thickness, the films are metastable to relaxation by dislocation mechanisms. The nanowire morphology produced by the methods of this invention provides the opportunity to markedly extend both the equilibrium and kinetic critical thicknesses (or equivalently, the lattice misfit that can be accommodated at a given thickness) due to the change in boundary conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> There are two primary effects. The first is the relaxation of the elastic boundary conditions normal to the growth direction. In the ideal thin film morphology, the strain energy stored in the coherent film per unit area increases linearly with film thickness. In a nanowire heterostructure, the &ldquo;film&rdquo; is constrained laterally only at the interface. As the nanowire &ldquo;film&rdquo; thickens, it will relax laterally so that the stored elastic strain energy saturates. In fact, some of the strain energy will also be stored on the &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; side, as this material may relax laterally as well. The result is that the equilibrium critical thickness for a given lattice mismatch will be extended relative to the thin-film value. Unlike the film case, there will be a finite range of lattice misfits that are associated with infinite critical thickness due to the saturation in stored elastic strain energy with thickness. Countering this first effect is the fact that the strain energy penalty associated with the misfit dislocation strain field is reduced due to the reduced volume of the nanowire. However, the core energy term remains and thus the first effect is expected to dominate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> 3.4 Longitudinal Heterostructure Nanowires (LOHNs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The success of semiconducting integrated circuits is largely determined by the capability of defect engineering through controlled doping. Defect engineering is expected to have even more profound effect on nanowires because not only will it contribute to doping and thereby lead to novel devices, it may also strongly influence electron scattering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Using the methods described herein, compositional profiles such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> are generated along the wire axis through successive feed-in of different dopant gas. For example, to achieve a LOHN comprising a Si pn-junction as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, species such as B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>would be sequentially used during nanowire growth. The CVD process allows accurate growth control of the compositional profile and makes it possible to fabricate junctions with sharp compositional interfaces. 1-D superlattices <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of Si/Ge and various III-V, II-VI, II-IV and tertiary and quaternary materials can also be fabricated using this approach as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Therefore, by sequentially changing the gas used in the VLS process, LOHNs can readily be synthesized. The process will, in general, allow bandgap engineering in 1-D and thereby also allow fabricating a sequence of multiple quantum dots. Quantum dots are currently grown either in solution or through island formation during thin film growth. Because the location of these quantum dots is not known apriori, it becomes very difficult to make contacts with individual quantum dots. By precisely integrating quantum dots within a single nanowire, the problems of making contacts are eliminated. One thus obtains what we refer to as a &ldquo;system on an nanowire.&rdquo; These novel 1D nanostructures offer great opportunities to explore new physics and phenomena for low dimensional systems. They can be potentially used as active nanoelectronic, nano-optical nanothermoelectric or nanoelectromechanical devices. It is also possible to synthesize nanowires of different crystal structures, such as zinc blende and wurzite CdSe and GaN nanowires. This can be achieved by using different substrates to trap certain metastable phases through the epitaxial growth relationship between the substrates and nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> 3.5 Co-Axial Heterostructure Nanowires (COHNs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to synthesize co-axial nanostructures such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> using the as-made nanowires as physical templates. For example, conformal and uniform carbon coating on Ge nanowires can be obtained by decomposing organic molecules on the wire surface. This approach can be readily extended to create COHNs with strong electron confinement effect. For example, GaAs nanowires fabricated using VLS could be subsequently coated with a thin layer of Al<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>As by using low temperature chemical vapor deposition process that effectively avoids crystal growth along the wire axis and promotes surface overgrowth of Al<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>As. Note, however, that the sheath can be crystalline or amorphous, and can include materials such as polymers, semiconductors, oxides, and the like. To form a COHN, a single-segment nanowire or a LOHN would first be formed according to any of the methods described herein. The single-segment nanowire or the LOHN, which will become the core of the COHN is then used as a template for forming the sheath. For example, the sheath can be formed by polymerization of monomers on the surface of the single-segment nanowire or the COHN. Alternatively, any physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process can be used to coat the single-segment nanowire or the LOHN. Examples of core/sheath materials, respectively, include, but are not limited to, Si and ZnO, Ge and C, Si and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SnO2 and TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, GaN and ZnO, GaAlN and GaN. Note that there is essentially an unlimited number of core/sheath material configurations. Even oxides, such as ZnO, can be used for the core material. The following is a list of core/sheath configurations where, for example, both the core and the sheath are monocrystalline: TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; M:TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(M&equals;Mn, Fe, Co, Cr, etc.); PbTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; BaTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; LaMnO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; and HTSC/SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(high temperature semiconductor&mdash;HTSC); GaAs/GaAlAs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Note also that this approach can be used to synthesize a nanotube. For example, a Ge nanowire core could be coated with an organic molecular material. The surface of the organic material would then be carbonized by pyrolysis in a vacuum. The Ge nanowire core would then be melted or evaporated at a temperature ranging from approximately 800&deg; C. to approximately 1000&deg; C., thereby forming a carbon nanotube. In addition, the same process may be utilized to form a &ldquo;nanocylinder&rdquo;, in which a COHN structure is formed and the core is then differentially etched away, leaving only the outer sheath (or cylinder). This cylinder may be made from any of the materials from which a sheath may be made, including but not limited to C, Si and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SnO2 and TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, GaN and ZnO, GaAlN and GaN. It will be appreciated that structural characterization of these nanowires will rely heavily on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Both XRD and TEM will allow for determining the structure/phase of the nanowires. In addition, TEM will provide further information on the defect structures within individual wires, the local microstructure at the interface, growth direction, and overall crystallinity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 4.1.1 Modeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The role of interface roughness and localization in nanowires has been extensively studied in quantum wires defined using electron beam lithography or using electrostatic confinement with split gate method. The transition from ballistic to diffusive transport, positive and negative magneto resistance, conductance quantization and universal fluctuations have been observed at low temperatures. Nanowires fabricated using the process of the present invention provide a unique opportunity to study electron transport in a variety of 1D electronic materials. In addition, the possibility to dope the nanowires similar to CVD deposited thin film materials gives an extra degree of freedom to investigate dominant scattering mechanisms at various electron densities. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in COHNs, modulation doping of wider bandgap material will allow spatial separation of ionized dopants <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and free carriers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and thus higher mobilities could be achieved. Confining free carriers to the core region inside the nanowire sheath will reduce the surface scattering effects. When electrons occupy cylindrical regions next to the heterostructure interface in coaxial nanowires, new quantized whispering gallery electronic states can also be formed. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, heterostructures along the direction of a LOHN nanowire will allow formation of quantum dot states <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. These states can significantly affect electronic properties of nanowires. One could observe coulomb blockade as well as 1D resonant tunneling features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, modeling is preferably carried out in two stages. First, simple 1D band structure models and relaxation time approximation are used to estimate electron mobility along the nanowires at higher temperatures. More elaborated models are then utilized, such as variable range hopping, to take into account the surface/interface scattering and calculate the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity. Other factors, such as modifications in phonon spectra and scattering times, electron-phonon interaction, and so forth may be studied using Monte Carlo simulations of the Boltzmann equation. Note that heterostructure nanowires can contain several confined and interface phonon modes that can scatter electrons differently from what one may find in bulk semiconductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> 4.1.2 Characterization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In order to characterize the electronic properties of bulk and heterostructure nanowires, it is important to measure the doping concentration profile along the nanowire, electron mobility, potential barrier at the hetero interfaces, etc. Conventional bulk or thin film characterization methods have to be carefully examined before applying to nanowire materials. Electrical conductivity along the nanowire is an important parameter and should be characterized over a wide range of temperatures. In addition, measurement of the magneto resistance will give more information how the surface scattering affects electron transport. Measurement of the thermoelectric properties (Seebeck coefficient) will give more information about the features of the electronic density-of-states and scattering mechanisms near the Fermi surface. Measurement of thermionic emission current can be used to determine the heterostructure barriers along the nanowire direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy (BEEM) is one of the ideal techniques to measure the &ldquo;localized&rdquo; electronic properties of nanowire structures and characterize the coaxial heterostructures. BEEM is a powerful low energy electron microscopy technique for lateral imaging and spectroscopy (with nm resolution for buried structures placed up to 30 nm below the surface). The BEEM technique has been used to study a variety of self-assembled quantum dot structures grown on GaAs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> GaSb quantum dots grown on GaAs were observed through STM and BEEM images. In the STM image, a roughly circular feature &tilde;50 nm in diameter and &tilde;5 nm tall, marked the lateral position of the buried dot. The area in the BEEM image aligned with the dot profile in STM was darker than the surrounding region, implying that the BEEM current through the dot is reduced due to electrons reflection off the potential barrier of the dot. The height of this barrier (i.e. the local band offset) can be extracted from the changes in BEEM spectra between the on and off cases. The on dot and off dot BEEM spectra of several dots were fitted by using a modified Bell-Kaiser planar tunneling model, giving a local conduction band offset for GaSb dots on GaAs of 0.08&plusmn;0.02 eV. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows the band profile and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows the characteristic BEEM spectra for GaSb/GaAs self-assembled single quantum dots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In addition to measuring properties such as the heterojunction band offset, the technique has been used to study the electronic band structure of new materials such as Ga As<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x </subscript></highlight>Nx alloys, the effect of ordering on the band structure of GaInP and resonant tunneling through InP quantum dots confined between AlInP barriers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> It is clear that BEEM can be used to characterize the electronic properties not only of the individual nanowires, but also the variation of longitudinal heterostructures of the type described herein, as illustrated in the configuration <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. Confinement effects would lead to structure in the BEEM current which can be analyzed through second-derivative (SD) BEEM spectroscopy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Observing light emission from nanowires is extremely challenging because of the role of surface states and non-radiative recombination at these states. With the use of coaxial heterostructure nanowires (COHNs) electrons are confined in the center regions inside the wire. The effect of free surfaces is thus reduced. Photoluminescence spectroscopy in a wide range of temperatures can be used to study light emission from nanowires, taking advantage of superresolution techniques in order to obtain images with subwavelength spatial resolution. Additionally, scanning solid immersion lenses can be used to characterize localized light emission from individual nanowires. Fabrication and characterization of pn junctions in nanowires is one of the key building blocks for optoelectronic devices. DC and pulsed electrical and optical methods can be used to measure photocurrent, recombination lifetime and electroluminescence in nanowires. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Phonon transport in nanowire heterostructures can be vastly different from that in bulk semiconductors mainly because the dispersion relation is significantly modified due to impose confinement in two directions. Second, the presence of heterostructure interfaces introduce phonon modes which exist at the interfaces. These result in many different phonon polarizations other than the two transverse and one longitudinal acoustic branches found in bulk semiconductors. These changes in the dispersion relation modifies the group velocity and the density of states of each branch. The changes in phonon temperatures come from two sources. First, the phonon-phonon interactions can change because selection rules based on energy conservation and wave-vector relations depend on the dispersion relation. Second, boundary scattering can be much stronger in nanowires (5-50 nm diameter) than in bulk semiconductors. Finally, because nanowire confinement can allow us to access new crystalline phases, the phonon dispersion relation can be drastically modified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The thermal and thermoelectric properties of nanowires according to the present invention can be measured using a microfabricated structure comprising two suspended heaters that contain e-beam lithographically fabricated wires. As a test, a multiwall carbon nanotube bundle was placed across the two heater sections so that the two heater sections were bridged. By monitoring the heat input from one heater and the temperature of both heaters, the nanotube thermal conductivity was extracted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> plots the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature of the multiwall carbon nanotube from 10&deg; K to 350&deg; K, indicating a T<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>behavior suggestive of phonon confinement in a 2-D material. The monotonic increase in thermal conductivity indicates suppression of phonon-phonon scattering and the presence of very long (e.g., &ap;1 &mgr;m) mean free paths. This approach can also be used for measuring thermal conductivities of COHNs and LOHNs according to the present invention. In addition, batch-fabricated atomic force microscope (AFM) probes were employed with temperature sensors on the tip for scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) to thermally and thermoelectrically characterize COHNs and LOHNs locally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, nanowire characterization computations focus on three aspects: (i) calculation of phonon dispersion relations, (ii) calculations of phonon lifetimes based on dopant scattering, nanowire size and boundary scattering, and three-phonon enharmonic interactions, and (iii) phonon transport calculations. Because wave effects (phonon bandgaps) are already accounted for in the dispersion relations, phase randomizing scattering may be assumed. Under these circumstances, the Boltzmann transport equation may be solved using Monte Carlo simulations where it is simple to account for the density of states of different polarization branches in a nanowire, as well as frequency dependent group velocities and phonon lifetimes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The thermopower of a semiconductor depends fundamentally on three properties: (i) the density of electronic states near the Fermi level, (ii) the electron effective mass, and (iii) carrier scattering rates. Because the electronic band structure (density of states and scattering rate) can be dramatically changed by quantum confining the electrons in a nanowire, one could engineer the band structure and the position of the Fermi level in order to tailor the thermopower. The suspended heater device described above can measure both temperature and potential difference across a nanowire. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows the thermopower measurements of multiwall carbon nanotubes in the 10&deg; K to 350&deg; K temperature range. The appearance of a positive thermopower indicates holes as the dominant carriers in these carbon nanotubes. Therefore, this device can be used to measure thermopower of nanowire heterostructures such as COHNs and LOHNs described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> 4.5 Piezoelectric Properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The wurtzite structure supports a spontaneous electric dipole moment, and thus materials with this structure are both pyroelectric and piezoelectric. These properties permit strong linear coupling between applied mechanical stress and polarization (direct piezoelectric effect), between applied electric field and strain (converse piezoelectric effect), and between a change in temperature and a change in polarization (pyroelectric effect). Wurtzite nanowires (e.g., GaAs, InAs, GaN, AIN, ZnO, etc) and nanowire heterostructures are thus potentially useful as sensors and actuators at the nanoscale. Potential applications include integrated atomic force microscopy probes, resonant mass sensors with single-molecule sensitivity, nanoscale thermal sensors, electric-field-tunable GHz filters, large displacement nanobeam actuators, and nanoscale flow sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In &lt;0001&gt; wurtzite nanowires, the spontaneous polarization is oriented along the wire axis. Thus, electric fields and metal mechanical stress applied along the wire axis will generate the largest piezoelectric response. The simplest electrode configuration utilizes contacts at the base and at the tip. Longitudinal stress applied with the tip and base contacts will be sensed by the direct piezoelectric effect. Since the wire cross-sectional area is small, large stresses can be generated with small forces. With the nanowire used as a resonant sensor, one end of the nanowire must be mechanically free, and a conductive surface in close proximity will be used to detect charge on the nanowire tip and to remove or add charge by tunneling. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> 5. Block-by-block Growth of Single-crystalline Si/SiGe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Heterojunction and superlattice formation is essential for many potential applications of semiconductor nanowires in nanoscale optoelectronics. Accordingly, we have developed a hybrid Pulsed Laser Ablation/Chemical Vapor Deposition (PLA-CVD) process for the synthesis of semiconductor nanowires with longitudinal ordered heterostructures. The laser ablation process generates a programmable pulsed vapor source, which enables the nanowire growth in a block-by-block fashion with well-defined compositional profile along the wire axis. Single crystalline nanowires with longitudinal Si/SiGe superlattice structure have been successfully synthesized. This unique class of heterostructured one-dimensional nanostructures holds great potential in applications such as light emitting devices and thermoelectrics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The success of semiconductor integrated circuits has been largely dependent upon the capability of heterostructure formation through carefully controlled doping and interfacing. In fact, 2-dimensional (2D) semiconductor interface is ubiquitous in optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diode, laser diodes, quantum cascade laser and transistors. Heterostructure formation in 1-dimensional (1D) nanostructures (nanowires) is equally important for their potential applications as efficient light emitting sources and better thermoelectrics. While there are a number of well-developed techniques (e. g. molecular beam epitaxy) for the fabrication of thin film heterostructures and superlattices, a general synthetic scheme for heterojunction and superlattice formation in 1D nanostructures with well-defined coherent interfaces is currently still lacking. Here, a hybrid Pulsed Laser Ablation/Chemical Vapor Deposition (PLA-CVD) process is described for the synthesis of semiconductor nanowires with periodic longitudinal heterostructures. Monocrystalline nanowires with Si/SiGe superlattice structure were obtained and thoroughly characterized using electron microscopy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Referring <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a nanowire growth apparatus <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. Growth apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> comprises a furnace <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> having a quartz reaction tube <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. A (111) Si wafer <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> coated with a thin layer of Au was put inside the quartz reaction tube <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> as substrate. A gas mixture of SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was continuously introduced into the reaction tube <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> through an inlet <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>.

Residue gas was exhausted through an outlet <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> together, nanowire growth using Au as a metal solvent at high temperature as previously described and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. This process starts with the dissolution of gaseous reactants in nanosized liquid droplets of the metal solvent, followed by nucleation and growth of single crystalline wires. The concept of heterostructured nanowires requires accurate compositional profile and interface control at nanometer or even atomic level while maintaining a highly crystalline and coherent interface along the wire axis. Based on our fundamental mechanistic understanding of VLS nanowire growth, this level of control is made possible here through successive feed-in of different vapor sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the size and size-distribution of the nanowire heterostructures can be controlled by using preformed and size controlled nanocrystal catalysts to form the nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Referring to the process flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, in the example illustrated Si/SiGe superlattice nanowires were synthesized by generating a Ge vapor in pulsed form through the pulsed ablation of the pure Ge target <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> with a frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser (wavelength 532 nm, 6 Hz, power density 10 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per pulse). The flow rate of the H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was approximately 100 sccm, the ratio of SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was approximately 0.02, and the system pressure was atmospheric pressure. The reaction temperature typically ranged from approximately 850&deg; C. to approximately 950&deg; C. At this temperature, the Au thin film <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> forms a liquid alloy with Si and spontaneously breaks up into nanometer sized droplets of Au&mdash;Si alloy <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. Next, the Si species continuously deposit into Au&mdash;Si alloy droplets where growth of the Si nanowire <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is initiated upon supersaturation. When the laser is turned off, only Si species deposit into the alloy droplet and a pure Si block is grown. However, if the laser is turned on during the growth process, Ge vapor will be generated and both Ge and Si species will be deposited into the alloy droplets. When the laser is turned on, SiGe alloy <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> then precipitates out from the solid/liquid interface. By periodically turning the laser on and off (this sequence can be easily programmed), an Si/SiGe superlattice <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is formed on every individual nanowire in a block-by-block fashion. The entire growth process resembles the living polymerization synthesis of block copolymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that various other nanowire structures can be grown using different gases and targets. For example, PbSe can be grown by laser ablation of a PbSe/Au target in Ar gas. Furthermore, growth of a nanowire superlattice according to the present invention is not limited to the foregoing synthetic process. One alternative approach would be to use multiple target materials and steer the laser with a computer for selection of target materials. Additionally, essentially any physical or chemical vapor deposition process that uses vapor supplies could be used, including, but not limited to, PLD, CVD, and MBE. For example, the vapor supplies could be configured with computer controlled valves to pulse the flow of the desired gas. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 5 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> A nanowire array <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> was synthesized using the process described in Example 4 and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the synthesized nanowire array was obtained. In the example shown, an Au film having a thickness on the Si (111) substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of 20 nm was lithographically pattered into four sites. Each film site melted into four droplets which acted as the catalyst for a corresponding nanowire. During the growth process, the laser was periodically turned on for 5 seconds and off for 25 seconds, and the cycle was repeated for 15 min. As previously shown, Si nanowires grow preferably along &lsqb;111&rsqb; direction, which results in the oriented epitaxial nanowire array growth on the Si (111) substrate. The alloy droplets solidify and appear as a bright spot on the tip <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of every nanowire <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Close examination of the nanowires showed the tips as having a flower-like shape which is formed during the solidification of the liquid alloy droplet. The diameters of these nanowires ranged from approximately 50 nm to approximately 300 nm. Using a Philip CM200 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 KeV, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of two nanowires in bright-field mode showed dark stripes appearing periodically along the wire axes, which originated from the periodic deposition of SiGe alloy and Si segments. The electron scattering cross section of Ge atom is larger than that of Si. Consequently, the SiGe alloy block appears darker than the pure Si block. The chemical composition of the darker area was examined using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) which showed a strong Si peak and apparent Ge doping (&tilde;12 weight % Ge) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. The periodic modulation of Ge doping was further confirmed by scanning a focused electron beam along the nanowire growth axis and tracking the change of X-ray signal from Si and Ge atoms in the wires as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. Both Si and Ge X-ray signals showed periodic modulation and intensities that were anti-correlated; in other words, wherever the X-ray signal from Ge showed a maximum, the signal from Si showed a minimum, which confirms the formation of Si/SiGe superlattice along the wire axis. We noted that the abruptness of the Si/SiGe interface in these nanowires is not ideal at this stage. It is believed that this could be improved by incorporating more precise and faster vapor dosing/switching schemes such as molecular beam process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> It must be emphasized that the elastic boundary conditions of heteroepitaxial growth offer the possibility to create dislocation-free interfaces in the superlattice nanowires that are not stable in the conventional 2D configuration achieved by epitaxial film growth on planar substrates. Although coherent heteroepitaxial films can be grown well beyond the equilibrium critical thickness, the films are metastable to relaxation by dislocation mechanisms. The VLS nanowire morphology provides an opportunity to markedly extend both the equilibrium and kinetic critical thicknesses&mdash;or equivalently, the lattice misfit that can be accommodated at a given thickness&mdash;due to the change in boundary conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The highly crystalline nature of our superlattice nanowires was characterized by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). An SAED pattern was recorded perpendicular to a nanowire long axis. The pattern was then indexed as the diffraction along the &lsqb;110&rsqb; zone axis of crystalline Si and suggested the nanowire growth does occur along &lsqb;111&rsqb; direction. This was further confirmed in the HRTEM image which clearly showed the (111) atomic planes (separation 0.314 nm) perpendicular to the nanowire axis. While the interface contrast was readily seen in the STEM images, we were not able to resolve the interface in HRTEM mode due to low doping percentage in SiGe blocks. These HRTEM images, however, clearly demonstrated the high crystallinity of the Si/SiGe superlattice nanowires. Extensive HRTEM imaging indicated that the mono-crystallinity of the Si/SiGe superlattice nanowire is maintained along the entire wire length with few linear or planar defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Taken together, the structural and chemical composition data showed that nanowires prepared by the PLA-CVD method according to the present invention are highly crystalline with Si/SiGe superlattice structure along the nanowire axis. The diameters of the nanowires, the concentration of Ge and the period of chemical modulation can be readily controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions. The nanowire diameter is influenced by the thickness of Au layer on substrate. For example, with 20 nm thick Au thin films, the average diameter of nanowires is around 100 nm. If the thickness of Au is reduced to 1 nm, the average diameter can be reduced to 20 nm. The diameter is also affected by the reaction temperature, wherein lower temperatures result in thinner nanowires. The concentration of Ge in the superlattice is controlled by the ratio of Ge atoms and Si atoms deposited into the alloy droplets. Increasing the laser intensity or decreasing the flow rate of SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>can increase the concentration of Ge. In addition, the superlattice period (L) is the product of growth rate (V) and laser on-and-off period (T): L&equals;V&times;T. Therefore, by reducing the growth rate or the laser on-and-off period, we are able to reduce the superlattice period. Similarly, the ratio of different compositional blocks can be readily adjusted by varying the laser on/off ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Importantly, by putting these &ldquo;labels&rdquo; along the wire growth axis, the PLA-CVD process provides a quantitative way to measure the growth rate of nanowires (V&equals;L/T) and its correlation with growth supersaturation. While the laser on-and-off period T is preset, knowing the superlattice period L, the growth rate V can be accurately calculated. We found that the growth rate is diameter-dependent under the same reaction conditions. The smaller the nanowire diameter, the slower is the growth rate as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> which shows the correlation between growth rate and diameter observed in our experiment. The trend can be qualitatively explained by the Gibbs-Thomson effect, such as increasing Si vapor pressure and thereby decreasing supersaturation as the nanowire diameter becomes smaller. The decrease of supersaturation as a function of nanowire diameter (d) is given as

These nanowires could be used as important building blocks for constructing nanoscale electronic circuit and light emitting devices.

The design of these devices flows directly from the fundamental scientific understanding of the effect of 1-D confinement on various physical properties. Although such scientific understanding can rely on single nanowire studies, it will be appreciated that devices will require multiple nanowires for integration into systems.

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 6 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> For purposes of discussion we will focus on the three devices stated above; however, they are by no means the only devices possible using nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> 6.1 Thermoelectric Refrigeration and Power Generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Solid-state refrigeration and power generation can be achieved using the Peltier effect, whereby a current flow across thermoelectric junctions produces can produce cooling (or heating). Conversely, a temperature difference across a thermoelectric material generates a current flow across a potential drop, and thereby electrical power. Compared to current vapor-compression refrigerators and gas-based engines, such solid-state devices are extremely promising because: (i) they do not contain any moving parts; (ii) they are environmentally benign; and (iii) allow for miniaturization. The reason they are not currently widely used is because their performance (efficiency for engines and coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigerators) is much inferior to gas/vapor based systems. If, however, the performance could be improved to be comparable or better than the vapor based systems, one could envision a drastic change in how we utilize or convert energy. This provides a strong and compelling reason to develop thermoelectric devices based on nanowires. As discussed below, this can only be achieved using nanowires according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The materials used for solid-state thermoelectric refrigerators and power generators are characterized by a figure of merit, ZT&equals;S<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&sgr;T/k, where S is the thermopower, k is the thermal conductivity, &sgr; is the electrical conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature. Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and its alloys are currently the most widely used materials and have a ZT&equals;1. It can be theoretically shown that if ZT&equals;3, the performance of thermoelectric refrigerators and engines can be comparable to those of vapor compression ones. In fact, if thermoelectric materials are nanostructured, quantum confinement of electrons and phonons can drastically increase their ZT, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. 1-D nanowires in particular could reach ZT&ap;2 to 5 if the wire diameter lies in the range of 5 nm to 10 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> 6.1.1 Nanowire Design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Because high electron mobility provides high ZT, it is preferably to use COHNs since they will have much reduced dopant and interface scattering. The thermopower of COHNs can be tailored through bandgap engineering. Because thermal conductivity of materials is generally inversely proportional to the atomic mass (&zgr;), a high-&zgr; material would be the material of choice. It is for this reason that Bi or Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te3 nanowires are good candidates for thermoelectric applications. The thermal conductivity can be further reduced by decreasing the nanowire diameter since boundary scattering is expected to be dominant for nanowire diameters less than 20 nm at room temperatures. In addition to Bi2Te3, other materials can be used, such as SiGe or InGaAs where alloy scattering can reduce phonon transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> 6.1.2 Device Design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Because nanowires are fragile, they should be embedded in a matrix to provide mechanical strength. For example, arrays of Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or SiGe COHN nanowires would be embedded in a polymer or dielectric material as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> to form a thermoelectric device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The thermoelectric device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> comprises upper and lower electrically insulating substrates <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, respectively, an n-doped nanowire array <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> that is separately grown on a substrate <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and wherein the nanowires <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are embedded in a polymer matrix <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and a p-doped nanowire array <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> that is separately grown on a substrate <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and wherein the nanowires <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> are embedded in a polymer matrix <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The wafers of n- and p-doped thermoelectric nanowire arrays are the brought together and bonded to with a series electrical connection and a parallel thermal connection to make a thermoelectric cooler or power generators. These connections are achieved by forming and connecting metal contact pads <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> as shown. The nanowire arrays can be easily embedded in a polymer matrix by flowing a polymer solution after the nanowires are fabricated, and then curing it using heat or UV radiation. To make the upper contacts <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (i.e., at the tips of the nanowires), the polymer will be preferentially etched down till the nanowires are exposed, after which metal contact pads are deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The design parameters for such a composite are: (a) surface density of nanowires; and (b) thickness of the device. The idea is to exploit the ultra-low thermal conductivity of polymers (k&ap;0.1 W/m-K) and the high power factors (S<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&sgr;) of the nanowires in order to achieve high ZT. Device performance can be characterized by measuring (a) effective electrical conductivity of the device; (b) effective thermal conductivity of the device; (c) effective Seebeck coefficient; (d) temperature difference across the device in response to a current flow; and (e) electrical power in response to a temperature difference or heat flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> 6.2 Light-Emitting Devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Nanowire composite materials have two distinct properties that can be used for light emitting device applications. On one hand, the low dimensional confinement of electrons and quantization of energy levels can be used for tuning of absorption and emission wavelength. The 1D nature of crystal growth along the nanowire could permit higher flexibility in the lattice mismatch between different materials and thus wider change in absorption and emission spectra. On the other hand, Si and III-V semiconductors have an index of refraction (3-4) that is much higher than air or silica fiber (1-1.5). This creates a mode size mismatch that is one of the main difficulties to couple light between fibers and semiconductor devices. This also limits the external quantum efficiency of light emitting diodes, since most of the emitted photons are reabsorbed in the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Based on the scientific understanding of the electronic band structure of various II-V and II-VI nanowires, nanowires can be designed for efficient absorption and emission of photons. For example, referring <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31, a</cross-reference> nanowire-polymer composite array <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can be made by integrating a plurality of semiconductor nanowires <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> into a polymer matrix <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> as previously described, thus producing an optically active material with a much lower effective index. The change in polymer refractive index with temperature is typically an order of magnitude higher than conventional semiconductors. This large thermo-optic coefficient can be combined with electronic-electronic properties of semiconductor nanowires to produce novel energy conversion devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Preferably, nanowires with the highest radiative efficiencies are integrated inside the polymer matrix in order to fabricate and characterize light emission devices. In addition, by using a mixture of nanowires made from different materials, one can achieve wider emission spectra and white light behavior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, an electron ejection light emitting diode/laser diode <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is shown schematically as comprising a nanowire <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> having pn junction <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> formed from growth of an n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and a p-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. A positive electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and negative electrode <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> are attached to the n- and p-type materials, respectively. Application of a potential across the electrodes will cause light emission by electron ejection as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. This structure can be formed using, for example, ZnO, Si/Ge, and GaN with appropriate dopants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, using longitudinal heterostructure nanowires (LOHNs) <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, one can make single quantum dot LEDs and study the effect of quantum dot size and material on the emission spectrum. The unique geometry of the quantum wire allows delivery of electrons and holes directly to the dots <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> and thus avoids the paths where electrons and holes would recombine in other places. Quantum dots can be formed using, for example, Si/Ge, PbSe/PbTe, arid Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/Sb<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. One could even put the composite nanowire-polymer medium inside a vertical cavity distributed dielectric mirror to provide for optical feedback and study the stimulated emission and laser action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Additionally, sophisticated T-shaped, V-grooved and Ridge quantum wire lasers and also quantum dot lasers have can be fabricated and characterized. These devices have unique properties due to 1D and 0D nature of electronic density of states. In particular, the increase in the differential gain will improve the high speed modulation characteristics. Size variation is also used to change electronic energy states and the emission spectrum. We expect that light emission in COHNs and LOHNs will create a new class of energy conversion devices where opto-electronic properties can be tailored beyond what can be achieved with current methods. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> As can be seen, therefore, nanowires according to the present invention can be used for fabricating a variety of devices in addition to those described above, including, but not limited to: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> (h) Polymer-nanowire composite light emitting devices (high external quantum efficiency, broad spectrum, good coupling with fiber). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> (i) Polymer-nanowire composite optical modulators (can make very high speed traveling wave modulators because the speed of electrical and optical signals could be matched). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> (j) Polymer-nanowire composite optical detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> (k) Polymer-nanowire composite waveguides and couplers (by growing nanowires with directional channels between the nanowires). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that LOHNs can be used to fabricate multi-terminal devices (i.e., N&gt;2) such as pnp devices. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> shows an example of a 3-terminal pnp LOHN <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> fabricated with a p-type material <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>, n-type material <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>, and p-type material <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> and having terminals T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and T<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> illustrates another example of a 3-terminal LOHN <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> 6.4 Nanoelectromechanical Devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Nanowire pyroelectric and piezoelectric devices have, in principal, the following inherent features that distinguish them from film or bulk devices: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> (a) High quality factors: The lack of extended defects should enable high mechanical quality factors in nanowire resonators. The low defect density also suggests low loss tangents and thus a high electromechanical coupling figure-of-merit (proportional to (tan &dgr;)<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> (b) High surface-to-volume ratio: The low mass per unit length, combined with the high ratio of adsorption sites to the nanowire volume will permit resonant detection of mass increments at sensitivities approaching the single molecule level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> (c) Variable length without change in materials quality: Nanowire longitudinal resonators can be made at various lengths from submicron to tens or hundreds of microns, thus allowing the fabrication of sensors or actuators with a wide range of fundamental resonant frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> (d) Nanoscale Diameter: The small diameter permits the use of piezoelectric and pyroelectric nanowires as direct probes of forces at the atomic and molecular scale, and temperature at the nanoscale. Furthermore, &ldquo;nanobeam&rdquo; unimorph benders with longitudinal electrodes and elastic layers fabricated by shadow evaporation will be capable of very large deflections clue to length: thickness aspect ratios approaching 1000:1 and the large transverse electric fields possible with moderate voltages (e.g., 100 MV/m for 1 V applied across a 10 nm thick nanobeam). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>, examples of nanowire device configurations for electromechanical transducers are illustrated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> illustrate a longitudinal configuration, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> illustrate a transverse configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, in &lt;0001&gt; wurtzite, the spontaneous polarization is longitudinal, i.e., oriented along the wire axis. Thus, electric fields and mechanical stress applied along the wire axis will generate the largest piezoelectric response. In the longitudinal configuration <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the simplest electrode configuration utilizes contacts (electrodes) <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> at the base and at the tip, respectively. Longitudinal stress applied with the tip and base contacts will be sensed by the direct piezoelectric effect. Since the wire cross-sectional area is small, large stresses can be generated with small forces. For example, a uniaxial tensile force of 100 nN corresponds to a uniaxial stress of 100 MPa for a wire with a cross-sectional area of (10 nm)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. A piezoelectric coefficient of 5 nC/N will thus generate a change of polarization of 0.5 C/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, a value that is certainly detectable. With the nanowire used as a resonant sensor, one end of the nanowire must be mechanically free, and a conductive surface in close proximity will be used to detect charge on the nanowire tip and to remove or add charge by tunneling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39, a</cross-reference> completely distinct sensing and actuation capability can be expected from wurtzite nanowires in &lt;hki<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&gt; orientation, that is, with the spontaneous polarization perpendicular to the wire growth direction. Such nanowires can be grown by choosing the appropriate surface orientation of the single-crystal substrate, e.g. sapphire with substrate with (0001) or (hki<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) orientation. In this transverse configuration <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, electrodes may be placed at the wire ends, thus activating the piezoelectric shear mode, d<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>, or along the wire length, employing d<highlight><subscript>31</subscript></highlight>. In the d<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> where electrodes <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are placed along the wire length, it is possible to exploit the expected large electric breakdown strength (&gt;300 MV/m) and high fracture strength of defect-free AIN nanowires to fabricate both high-displacement nanobeam unimorph benders and force sensors. Presuming that a suitable elastic layer is shadow deposited on one side of the nanowire, opposite an electrode stripe, the tip displacement, &dgr;, of the nanowire will be on the order of d<highlight><subscript>31</subscript></highlight>L<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>V/t<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. For transverse voltage of 1V, thickness of 10 nm, length of 5 &mgr;m and d<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>of 3 pm/V, the tip displacement is expected to be about 0.75 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The transverse configuration represents synthesis and processing challenges beyond those expected for the longitudinal configuration. For example, the nanowire must be nucleated in the transverse orientation, which will likely require nucleation on a crystalline wurtzite substrate or seed. Once nucleated, the surface energy anisotropy is expected to yield nanowires of rectangular cross section, ideal for shadow deposition. Based on the substantial literature on lateral growth experiments with GaN, it is likely that the growth rate of transverse nanowires will greatly exceed that of longitudinal wurtzite nanowires. Once synthesized, nanobeam unimorph benders may be fabricated by shadow deposition of metallic layers&mdash;one thin compliant metallization to serve as an electrode (e.g., Cr/Au), and a second stiffer layer on the opposite side (e.g., Ti/Pt) to serve both as an electrode, and as an elastic layer to optimize the position of the neutral axis for bending-mode actuation. Alternatively, it is possible to make use of the substantially different surface properties of the opposing basal faces to selectively deposit metals by solution processing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Development of short-wavelength semiconductor lasers is of great current interest. This has culminated in the realization of room-temperature green-blue diode laser structures with ZnSe and ln<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>N as the active layers. ZnO is another wide band-gap (3.37 eV) compound semiconductor that is suitable for blue optoelectronic applications. In fact, ultraviolet lasing action has been reported in disordered ZnO particles and thin films. For wide band-gap semiconductor materials, a high carrier concentration is usually required in order to provide an optical gain that is high enough for lasing action in an electron-hole plasma (EHP) process. Such EHP mechanism, which is common for conventional laser diode operation, typically requires high lasing thresholds. As an alternative to EHP, excitonic recombination in semiconductors can facilitate low-threshold stimulated emission because of its bosonic nature. To achieve efficient excitonic laser action at room temperature, exciton binding energy (E<highlight><superscript>b</superscript></highlight>ex) has to be much larger than the thermal energy at room temperature (26 meV). In this regard, ZnO is a good candidate since its E<highlight><superscript>b</superscript></highlight>ex is approximately 60 meV, which is significantly larger than that of ZnSe (22 meV) and GaN (25 meV). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> To further lower the threshold, low-dimensional compound semiconductor nanostructures have been fabricated, in which quantum size effects yield a substantial density of states at the band edges and enhance radiative recombination due to carrier confinement. The use of semiconductor quantum well structures as low-threshold optical gain media represents a significant advancement in semiconductor laser technology. Stimulated emission and optical gain have also been demonstrated recently in Si and CdSe nanoclusters and their ensembles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, we have demonstrated the first excitonic lasing action in ZnO nanowires with a threshold of 40 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>under optical excitation. The chemical flexibility as well as one-dimensionality of the nanowires makes them ideal miniaturized laser light sources. These short-wavelength nanolasers could have myriad applications including optical computing, information storage, and nano-analysis. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 7 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> ZnO nanowires were synthesized using a vapor phase transport process via catalyzed epitaxial crystal growth on sapphire (110) substrates. Patterned Au thin film was used as the catalyst for nanowire growth. For the nanowire growth, clean (110) sapphire substrates were coated with 10-35 Angstrom thick gold with or without using TEM grids as shadow masks (micro contact printing of thiols on Au followed by selective etching has also been used to create the Au pattern). An equal amount of ZnO powder and graphite powder were ground and transferred to an alumina boat. The Au-coated sapphire substrates were typically placed 0.5-2.5 cm from the center of the boat. The starting materials and the substrates were then heated up to 880&deg; C. to 905&deg; C. in an argon flow. Zn vapor was generated by carbothermal reduction of ZnO and transported to the substrates where ZnO nanowires grew. The growth generally took place within 2-10 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The nanowires were epitaxially grown on the substrate and formed highly oriented arrays. Selective nanowire growth can be readily achieved when patterned Au thin film was used. ZnO nanowires grew only in the Au coated area with an excellent selectivity due to the catalytic nature of Au thin layer. The area of these nanowire arrays can be readily extended to cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Generally, the diameters of these wires are in the range of 20 nm to 150 nm while majority of them have diameters of 70 nm to 100 nm. The diameter dispersion is due to the inhomogeneous sizes of the Au nanocluster catalysts when the substrate is annealed during the growth process. The lengths of these nanowires can be varied between 2 &mgr;m and 10 &mgr;m by adjusting the growth time. This capability of patterned nanowire growth allows us to fabricate nanoscale light emitters on the substrate in a controllable fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> We observed that nearly all the nanowires grew vertically from the substrates. This is due to the fact that a good epitaxial interface exists between the (0001) plane of the ZnO nanowire and (110) plane of the substrate. The ideal a plane (110) of sapphire is two-fold symmetric while the ZnO c-plane is six-fold symmetric. They are essentially incommensurate with the exception that the ZnO&apos;s a -axis and the sapphire&apos;s c-axis are related almost exactly by a factor of 4 (mismatch less than 0.08% at room temperature). Such coincidental match up along the sapphire &lsqb;0001&rsqb; direction, along with a strong tendency of ZnO to grow in the c-orientation as well as the incoherence of interfaces in directions other than sapphire &lsqb;0001&rsqb;, leads to the unique vertical epitaxial growth configuration. The anisotropy of the sapphire&apos;s a plane is critical for growing high quality c-oriented ZnO nanowire arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> SEM images of the nanowire array were obtained. Hexagon end planes of the nanowires could be clearly identified. This is a strong evidence that these nanowires grow along the &lt;0001&gt; direction and are indeed well-faceted both at the end and side surfaces. The well-faceted nature of these nanowires will have important implications when they are used as effective laser media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Additional structural characterization of the ZnO nanowires was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A high resolution TEM image of a single-crystalline ZnO nanowire was obtained. A spacing of 2.56&plusmn;0.05 Angstroms between adjacent lattice planes corresponded to the distance between two (0002) crystal planes, further indicating that &lt;0001&gt; is the preferred growth direction for the ZnO nanowires. Significantly, this &lt;0001&gt; preferential nanowire growth on the sapphire substrate is also reflected in the X-ray diffraction pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> that was taken on a Siemens Z5000. Only (0001) peaks were observed, indicating excellent overall c-axis alignment of these nanowire arrays over a large substrate area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Photoluminescence spectra of nanowires were measured using a He-Cd laser (325 nm) as an excitation source. Strong near-band gap edge emission at &tilde;377 nm has been observed. In order to explore the possible stimulated emission from these oriented nanowires, the power dependent emission was examined. The samples were optically pumped by the fourth harmonic of Nd: YAG laser (266 nm, 3 ns pulse width) at room temperature. The pump beam was focused on the nanowires at an incidence angle of 10 degrees to the symmetric axis of the nanowire. Light emission was collected in the direction normal to the end surface plane (along the symmetric axis) of the nanowires. Stimulated emission from the nanowires was collected in the direction along nanowire&apos;s end-plane normal (the symmetric axis) using a monochromator (ISA) combined with a Peltier-cooled CCD (EG&amp;G). All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Significantly, in the absence of any fabricated mirrors, we observed lasing action in these ZnO nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> shows the evolution of the emission spectra as pump power was increased. At low excitation intensity (below the lasing threshold), the spectrum consists of a single broad spontaneous emission peak (curve a) with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of approximately 17 nm. This spontaneous emission was 140 meV below the band gap (3.37 eV) and is generally ascribed to the recombination of excitons through exciton-exciton collision process where one of the exciton radiatively recombines to generate a photon. As the pump power increased, the emission peak narrows due to the preferential amplification of frequencies close to the maximum of the gain spectrum. When the excitation intensity exceeded the lasing threshold (&tilde;40 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), sharp peaks emerge in the emission spectra (curve b and inset). The pump power for these spectra were 20, 100, and 150 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, respectively. The line widths of these peaks are less than 0.3 nm, which are more than 50 times smaller than the line width of the spontaneous emission peak below the threshold. Above the threshold, the integrated emission intensity increases rapidly with the pump power, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>. The narrow line width and the rapid increase of emission intensity indicate that stimulated emission takes place in these nanowires. The observed single or multiple sharp peaks (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, curve b and inset) represent different lasing modes at wavelengths between 370 and 400 nm. It was observed that the lasing threshold is quite low compared with previously reported values for random lasing (&tilde;300 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) in disordered particles or thin films. Significantly, these short-wavelength nanowire nanolasers operate at room temperature and the areal density of these nanolasers readily reaches 1.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The fact that we observed lasing action in these nanowire arrays without any fabricated mirror prompts us to consider these single-crystalline, well-facetted nanowires act as natural resonance cavities to amplify stimulated emission. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a nanolaser <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> fabricated using a multi-faceted (in this example, hexagonal) ZnO nanowire <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> grown on a sapphire substrate <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. Note that nanowire <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is not a heterostructure but a homostructure in this application, however, it should be appreciated that the present invention is capable of heterostructure lasing as well as homostructure lasing. The nanowire acts as a resonant cavity with two naturally faceted hexagonal end faces <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> acting as reflecting mirrors. It is possible that the giant oscillator strength effect, that can occur in high quality nanowire crystals with dimensions larger than the exciton Bohr radius, but smaller than the optical wavelength, enables the excitonic stimulated emission in these nanowire arrays. For II-VI semiconductors, a cleaved edge of the specimen is usually used as a mirror. For our nanowires, one end is the epitaxial interface <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> between the sapphire substrate <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and ZnO while the other end is the sharp (0001) plane <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> of the ZnO nanocrystals. Both can serve as good laser cavity mirrors considering the refractive indexes for sapphire, ZnO and air are 1.8, 2.45 and 1.0, respectively. Note this is an important characteristic of this nanowire; namely, that it can be abutted against a waveguide very easily. This natural cavity/waveguide formation in nanowires suggests a simple chemical approach to form a nanowire laser cavity without cleavage and etching. In fact, when multiple lasing modes were observed for these nanowires (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> inset), the observed mode spacing is about 5 nm for &tilde;5 &mgr;m long wires, which agrees quantitatively well with the calculated spacing between adjacent resonance frequencies v<highlight><subscript>F</subscript></highlight>&equals;c/2nl, where V<highlight><subscript>F </subscript></highlight>is emission mode spacing, c the light speed, n the refractive index and/the resonance cavity length. Note also that an alternative manner in which a waveguide could be formed would be to coat the nanowire with a layer of polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> A laser according to the present invention can have nanowires supported in a solid polymer or glassy matrix, in solution, or extending off of the surface of a substrate. For wires attached to a substrate, the wires can either be disordered, or arranged so that they all point in the same direction. That direction can be normal to the substrate surface, or can be selected to be any other angle off of the substrate. In addition, even nanowires in a matrix material can be aligned so that they form an ordered structure. Note that the present invention includes lasers with the above-described nanowire-composite orientations, as well as non-laser heterostructures in the same configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> The decay of the luminescence from the ZnO nanowires was studied using a frequency-tripled mode-locked Ti: sapphire laser for pulsed excitation (200 fs pulse length) and a streak camera with ps-resolution for detection. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44, a</cross-reference> good fit (straight line) to the experimental data (dotted line) recorded at room temperature was obtained with a biexponential decay model assuming a fast and a slow process with time constants of about 70 ps and 350 ps, respectively. The time-resolved spectrum was recorded at excitation power of 6.39 mW. Therefore, these lifetime measurements show that the radiative recombination of the excitons is a superposition of a fast and a slow process. The luminescence lifetime is mainly determined by the concentration of defects, which trap the electrons and/or holes and eventually cause their nonradiative recombination. Although the exact origin of the luminescence decay remains unclear at this stage, the very long lifetime measured for these wires demonstrates the high crystal quality achieved with the nanowire growth process. Meantime, it also accounts in part for the low laser threshold reported here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In summary, we have demonstrated room-temperature ultraviolet lasing in well-oriented vertical ZnO nanowire arrays with a lasing threshold of 40 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The areal density of these nanolasers on substrate can readily reach 1.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>cm <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>. We anticipate that the lasing wavelength can be tuned into blue region by making alloy nanowires of ZnO/CdO. In addition, by creating pn junctions in these individual nanowires, one should be able to test the possibility of mating electron ejection blue lasers from individual nanowires. Such miniaturized nanowire nano-lasers will find applications in nano-photonics and microanalysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing it will be appreciated that nanowires according to the present invention can be used as optical cavities. Another way to create an optical cavity would be to create dielectrics on the ends of the wires. Additionally, some portions of the nanowire could have one energy transfer event and others have a different energy transfer event such as in a distributed feedback laser. It will also be appreciated that by capping off the ends of the optical cavity, either a laser or a light amplifier can be realized. Additionally, the cavity can be a part of the nanowire itself as previously described, the cavity could be external to the nanowire. In essence, a laser or light amplifier can be formed from a nanowire, a pumping source, and a cavity, wherein the cavity is part of the nanowire or separate from the nanowire. Furthermore, by using conventional stimulated emission techniques, a cavity is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that nanowires according to the present invention could be employed as a functional component of a quantum dot laser such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,957 incorporated herein by reference, wherein the quantum dots would be integrated into the nanowire as described herein and the pumping source would be configured for exciting a population inversion in the quantum dots. Note, however, that a nanowire itself can be pumped for lasing where the pumping promotes a population inversion in the nanowire. The nanowire can be embedded in a polymer matrix as previously described, and can function as an element in a matrix of such lasing devices. The pumping source can be an optical pumping source, such as a pumping laser, or an electrical pumping source having an anode and cathode which contact the nanowire either directly or through ohmic contacts. If a pumping laser is employed, the wavelength of the pump would preferably be higher than the nanowire by greater than approximately 10 meV, and more preferably greater than 100 meV. The nanowire can be placed in a cavity or the ends can be formed with reflective faces so that the nanowire functions as a cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> 6.6 Additional Devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that a number of devices can be fabricated using nanowires and the synthesis methods described above. Additional specific devices include, but are not limited to, the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> 6.6.1 Field-effect Transistor (FET). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> This is a three terminal device that can be realized using COHNs. The current flowing from the &ldquo;source&rdquo; to the &ldquo;drain&rdquo; is controlled by the voltage at the &ldquo;gate&rdquo;. The source and drain can be at any two points along the nanowire that contact the nanowire core. The gate contact is applied to the nanowire sheath at some point between the source and drain. The gate voltage controls the conductivity of the channel between the source and drain. At least two types of FETs can be fabricated in this manner. First, a junction FET is fabricated with a reverse bias pn junction at the gate. In this case the nanowire core is an n-type semiconductor and the sheath is p-type (or vice versa). Applying a reverse bias at the junction can increase the depletion region inside the core and thus inhibit current flow from the source to drain. The second kind of FET is based on metal-oxide (MOSFET) or metal-insulator (MISFET) contact at the gate. In this case the nanowire sheath is made of two sub-sheaths. The nanowire core is first covered with a layer of oxide or insulator and then with a conducting layer. Applying a voltage between the conducting sheath and the nanowire core can remove the channel between source and drain (depletion-mode MOSFET or MISFET) or create a channel (enhancement-mode MOSFET or MISFET) if the nanowire core did not have a conducting channel between the source and drain at zero gate voltage. Additionally, a three-terminal device such as, but not limited to, those depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> could be utilized with two terminals acting as source and drain and the third acting as a gate. In particular, it is possible to create a MOSFET structure in a three-terminal device in which an insulating heterojunction is placed between the source-drain path and the gate-electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> 6.6.2 Infrared Detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> An infrared (IR) detector can be made using nanowires made of semiconducting material having a bandgap within the infrared wavelengths (1-20 microns). The detector is preferably a two terminal device, with two connections at the two ends of the nanowire. Presence of light changes the conductivity of the nanowire, which is measured using an applied bias between the two terminals (photoconductor); or the light creates a voltage across the nanowire with no external biasing circuit (photovoltaic operation). Photovoltaic operation requires an internal electric field in the nanowire. This can be realized using p-n junction along the nanowire or metal/semiconductor junction at the contacts to the two extremes of nanowire. When the nanowire diameter is smaller than the electron deBroglie wavelength of electrons, quantum confinement effect will change the effective bandgap of material and the region of sensitivity to IR radiation. A second type of IR detector can be fabricated using LOHNs. Similar to quantum well infrared intersubband photodetectors, a series of heterostructures along the direction of nanowire create quantized electronic states inside conduction band or valence band of the material. Optical absorption between these electronic states can be tailored to be at any IR wavelength (1-20 microns), not limited by the bandgap of the material. Again contacts at the two ends of nanowire will allow realization of a photoconductive or photovoltaic IR detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> 6.6.3 Single Electron Infrared Detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> This device is similar to the previous LOHN-based infrared detector. The only difference is that the heterostructure layer parameters (length, nanowire diameter, composition) are chosen so that creation of a free electron inside that particular layer changes the electrostatic energy by an amount so that no other electrons can be transported across this layer until the free electron leaves (coulomb blockade). This enables detecting single electron (and thus single photon) events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> 6.6.4 Resonant Tunneling Diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> This is a two terminal device made of LOHNs. The basic idea is that a LOHN is divided into five segments (emitter, barrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, well, barrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, collector). The well layer is short enough so that electronic energy states are quantized. The band structure of the barrier layer is chosen so that electron wavefunction is evanescent but the electron transmission probability across the layer is non-zero. Under a bias, electrons are emitted from the emitter contact to the collector contact. At a specific bias, so that the energy of incident electrons from emitter corresponds to the quantized energy levels in the well, transmission across the whole structure is enhanced (resonant tunneling) which gives rise to negative differential resistance in the device current-voltage characteristics, and can be utilized by way of example, to make high speed oscillators or logic circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> 6.6.5 Light Emitting Diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> A single nanowire light emitting diode can be made of pn junction along the nanowire. A heterostructure near the depletion region (where electrons and holes recombine), can be used to make more efficient LEDs by confining the carriers. In order to make LEDs with an array of nanowires, it is important to incorporate an appropriate filling (polymer, etc.) with low absorption and scattering losses. The final device will be composed of two electrodes with nanowire composite in between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> 6.6.6 Electrically Pumped Laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> This is made of nanowire composite LEDs plus an optical cavity. The optical cavity can be made of dielectric mirrors in vertical configuration (along with contacts to the two sides of the nanowire composite material) or in a horizontal configuration (similar to distributed Bragg reflector lasers). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, nanowires are used either as a part of composite material (nanowire plus filling material) or light is guided inside the nanowire itself. In the latter case the main parameters in the design are the optical loss along the wire and the number of lateral modes. Typical design is based on COHNs, where the indices of the core and sheath layers are chosen to achieve a specific number of guided modes or group dispersion values (this is similar to the design of silica-based optical fibers). For the former case (nanowire composite material), it can be treated as a new engineered material and conventional methods to fabricate waveguides (ridge type, slab layer, etc.) can be used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> In the case of nanowire composite materials, basically we will have a filling material (e.g. a polymer) whose electro optical, thermo optical or magneto optical properties are modified by the incorporation of nanowire arrays. One can choose different materials and various wire diameters to tune the required properties (increase electro-optic coefficient, incorporate optical gain with nanowire pn junctions, etc.). Once the nanowire composite material is fabricated, it can be treated as a novel thin film material and conventional techniques to realize waveguide switches, modulators, couplers, etc. can be used. The main advantage is that the rich properties of passive and active heterostructure nanowires is combined with simple processing of polymer based thin film devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> 6.6.9 Electromechanical/Thermomechanical Devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Nanowires made of piezoelectric or piezoresistive materials could be used as electromechanical sensors. Under uniaxial strain, in the direction along the wire (longitudinal), a piezoelectric (e.g., AIN, ZnO) nanowire can produce a voltage signal, whereas a piezoresistive nanowire (e.g., Si) will produce a change in resistance, which can be measured by passing a current. When these are formed into a polymer matrix composite one can essentially get a flexible/conformal material that can be used to detect uniaxial strain. The piezoelectric device can be used to generate uniaxial motion as well. If nanowire heterostructures are formed in a way that a single crystal nanowire is coated on one side with another material (e.g., a partial COHN as described herein), then it could be used to generate bending motion as a bimorph. For example, if the two materials have different thermal expansion coefficients, they could be used for detecting temperature and anything that changes temperature (radiation absorption, electrical dissipation, and for forth). In addition, by changing the temperature this device could be used for thermal actuation. A nanowire-based bimorph can also be used to detect any strain perpendicular to the direction of the nanowire axis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> While nanowires can behave as chemical sensors, they can also be used for chemical logic. For example, consider a LOHN, which has segments of materials A, B, C. Supposing that material A becomes conductive when it adsorbs chemical A&prime;, while similarly B becomes conductive when it adsorbs material B&prime;. Now only in the presence of chemicals A&prime;, B&prime; and C&prime;, will high conductivity exist in the nanowire. This is a sort of chemical logic, i.e. A&prime; and B&prime; and C&prime;&equals;1 such that A&prime; and B&prime; and not C&prime;&equals;0 etc. If you put these structures in series/parallel networks, you could then generate AND and OR logic. One could of course extend this to biological sensing. In fact, it will be much easier for biological sensing, since bio-receptors are highly specific. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> 7. Conclusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing discussion it can be seen that when semiconductors are confined to 2, 1 or 0 dimensional structures in the size range of less than approximately 200 nm, and preferably in the range of approximately 5 nm to 50 nm, their properties can be manipulated in novel ways. The methods described herein along with other chemical synthesis techniques can be used to grow nanowires and associated heterostructures. These structures include coaxial heterostructure nanowires (COHNs) and longitudinal heterostructure nanowires (LOHNs) and combinations thereof. COHNs allow modulation doping such that nanowires with extremely high charge carrier mobility can be obtained, while LOHNs allow bandgap engineering in 1-D, which can lead to multiple quantum dots or pn junctions integrated within a single nanowire. Engineering the band structure near the Fermi level will also allow tailoring of their thermoelectric properties. 1-D confinement has a strong influence on phonon spectra and lifetimes, which could dramatically change their thermal properties. In addition, nanowire heterostructures offer the promising prospects of integrating piezoelectric nanostructures with semiconducting nanowires, resulting in nanoelectromechanical transducers. Also, the elastic boundary conditions in COHNs and LOHNs enable dislocation-free interlaces that are not stable in 2-D (quantum wells and heterostructures) or thin film form, while also providing access to new stable phases that are metastable in bulk or thin film forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> COHNs and LOHNs also lend themselves to the development of energy conversion devices, including thermoelectric refrigerators or power generators, light emitting devices, and nanoelectromechanical transducers. The active material in these devices comprises composites made of nanowire arrays preferably embedded in a polymer matrix, such that they can be patterned and integrated into microsystems. Semiconducting nanowires with diameters in the 5 nm to 10 nm range provide the unique opportunity to develop thermoelectric refrigerators and power generators with performances comparable to or better than those based on gas or vapor. Such solid-state devices could have enormous impact on energy utilization technology as well as on the environment. Use of nanowires containing integrated quantum dots can all efficient and size-tunable optoelectronic conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, embedding such nanowires in a polymer matrix will produce a light emitting flexible medium with much lower effective index than semiconductors, which will enable efficient coupling with optical fibers and thereby dramatically improve external quantum efficiencies. When combined with single electronics, such quantum dot nanowires offer the possibility of single photonic devices that can significantly impact information storage and processing. Nanowire-based piezoelectric transducers will lead to high quality factor and high resonant frequency devices that can be used for applications ranging from molecular sensing and nano-actuators to high-frequency signal processors. Finally, single-crystalline nanowires with naturally faceted end faces functioning as mirrors can be used for nanolaser devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> LOHNs containing heterostructures along the nanowire, length can also be designed to have very interesting properties, including, but not limited to: (a) pn or pnp or various other junctions that could be used for photonic devices, (b) multiple quantum dots with size-tunable optical absorption/emission and single electron tunneling properties, thus leading to single photonic devices; (c) nanowire superlattices with high electron mobility and reduced phonon transport, and thereby useful for thermoelectric devices; and (d) piezoelectric and electronic heterodevices for nanoelectromechanical transduction. Note also that the elastic boundary conditions of nanowire heteroepitaxial growth offer the possibility to create dislocation free interfaces in the superlattice nanowires that are not stable in the conventional 2-D configuration achieved by epitaxial film growth on planar substrates. On the other hand, there are cases where dislocations are desirable as well, and the present invention allows for defect control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Although much effort in the past has been focused on synthesizing and studying zero-dimensional (0-D) (quantum dots) and 2-D (quantum wells and heterostructures) nanostructures, semiconducting nanowires other than carbon nanotubes have received relatively little attention. Note, however, that compared to quantum dots, nanowires that are approximately 1 &mgr;m to approximately 10 &mgr;m long provide the unique opportunity of integrating nanostructures with photolithographically microfabricated features that are generally &ap;1 &mgr;m. In addition, nanowires also allow further confinement over 2-D structures that have been extensively studied and utilized in the past. Because of these favorable attributes, various other types of devices based on nanowire heterostructures can be designed and fabricated as well, including, but not limited to: (i) high efficiency thermoelectric refrigerators or power generators; (ii) tunable light emitting diodes; (iii) piezoelectric nanomechanical sensors and actuators. The use of nanowire heterostructures in these devices is critical, since they would either dramatically improve conversion efficiencies or open up new ways of conversion, as discussed in detail later. These simple devices also form the foundation for more sophisticated devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that various configurations can be achieved using the foregoing inventive structures, some of which have been previously described. By way of further example, and not of limitation, these configurations can include single and multiple junction LOHNs, single and multiple junction COHNs, combinations of LOHN and COHN structures, two-terminal configurations, N&gt;2 terminal configurations, combinations of heterostructures and homostructures, homostructures with one or more electrodes (which would also be an overall heterostructure), heterostructures with one or more electrodes, homostructures with insulators, heterostructures with insulators, and the like. It will also be appreciated that the interface between a nanowire and a terminal constitutes a heterojunction. A variety of devices can be fabricated using these structures and configurations, including, but not limited to, phonon bandgap devices, quantum dots that confine electrons in specific areas, thermoelectric devices (e.g., solid state refrigerators and engines), photonic devices (e.g., nanolasers), nanoelectromechanical (MEM) devices (electromechanical actuators and sensors), energy conversion devices of various forms including for example, light to mechanical energy or thermal energy to light, and other devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to a collection mode lens system, and more particularly to an optical system including a large area detector, a collecting lens and a small lens in which the field of view is determined by the acceptance angle or numerical aperture of the collecting lens, and the diameter of the small lens, and no pinhole is used in front of the detector. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Micromachining techniques have enabled the fabrication of lenses with diameters comparable to the wavelength of light. Microlenses which are many wavelengths in diameter are used for collimation of fiber optics, wave-front sensing, and fill-factor improvement in detectors. Microlenses are also used for high spatial resolution solid immersion microscopy, where light is focused through a lens with a high index of refraction held close to the sample surface. Spherical aberration in a lens is inversely proportional to radius of curvature, making microlenses more tolerant to wave-front errors than large lenses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As the diameter of a microlens is reduced, the ability of the lens to focus and collect light is affected. In a spherical lens, the field of view from which light is collected decreases with lens diameter. Microfabricated lenses with small fields of view can be used to direct beams of light by refracting off-axis rays. Small movements of a microlens in front of an optical fiber have been used for beam steering, optical interconnection and optical switching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One is often interested in visualizing a small region on a sample. This is usually accomplished by a confocal arrangement using a lens with a pinhole in front of the detector. If the pinhole is small, the size of the region on the sample which is visualized is given by the diffraction limit of the objective lens combination. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown an optical system comprising a collector lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having an acceptance angle or numerical aperture (NA) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a small lens <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a radius a. The small lens is formed by micromachining and is supported on a support <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The lens combination collects light from the surface of sample <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> placed a distance h from the center <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the spherical small lens <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The distance h may be positive or negative, but is chosen so that h&lt;&lt;a. The small lens <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is made very small, typically a few microns in diameter. The field of view of the sample is then limited by the size of the lens <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As is seen from the rays in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, energy from a sample surface at a point <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at the center of the small lens is collected by the collection lens <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> since it is diffracted so that it leaves the small lens at angles within the acceptance angle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, some energy from a point <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> displaced from the center of a small lens is internally reflected, rays <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, while other energy is diffracted, rays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and most of that energy leaving the small lens is not collected by the collector lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In an experiment, a point source was moved across a small Si lens having a 9.4 &mgr;m diameter and the light from the point source was collected. The experiment was conducted at a source wavelength of 9.2 &mgr;m where the index of refraction of Si lens is 3.4. The collection lens was 0.45-NA BaF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The light source was a tapered, gold-coated chalcogenide glass fiber with a 1 &mgr;m diameter tip for the point source. The NA of the objectives limited the angular range of the collected light to angles less than sin<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>(NA)&equals;27&deg; from the normal. The collection objective was focused on the fiber tip, and the Si lens was inserted between the tip and the objective with the curved surface of the lens towards the objective. The small lens was held within the near field of the fiber, and light emitted from the tip was coupled into the small lens. The small lens was scanned over the tip while the fiber and objective remained stationary. Since the field of view of the collection objective was much larger than the scan range, movement of the small lens relative to the objective did not affect collection of light within the objective&apos;s NA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When the center of the small lens was offset from the tip, we observed a decrease in collected light relative to a maximum when the small lens and tip are aligned. The variation of intensity with position of the point source from the center is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which shows the normalized amplitude of the received energy. It is seen that the fall width of half maximum (FWHM) of the spatial variation in collected intensity was approximately 1.8 &mgr;m or &lgr;/5. We attribute this contrast mechanism to internal reflection in the small lens and refraction of rays outside the NA of the collection by the small lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, an approximate explanation for the refraction mode of operation of the lens combination for a single point in a spread-out incoherent source is provided. First, it is determined how the illumination from a small spot is distributed in angles after it leaves the small lens <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. We assume that the detector is infinite in size and is located behind the collecting lens. We assume that the small lens is spherical in shape, and is illuminated from a small point P whose center is at a distance x from A on the axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A is a distance h in the axial direction from the center of the lens <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of radius a, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. Of interest is the ray reaching the point Q at a, &thgr;, &phgr; and the angle to the axis of the lens at which it leaves the lens. We take the angle between OQ and the axis to be &thgr;, and the angle between PQ and OQ as &psgr;. The direction cosines in the x, y and z directions of the line OQ in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are sin &thgr; cos &psgr;, sin &thgr; sin &psgr;, cos &thgr;, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The length of the line PQ in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is R where

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> We are interested in the exit angle of the rays from the small lens with respect to the lens axis. In order to find this angle, it is necessary to first find the angle between the projection of the line PQ on the plane AOQ. To do this, we first find the projection of AP on AOQ, which is x cos &phgr;. Taking this to be the x&prime; direction on the plane AOQ, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, we find the directions cosines of the line OQ in the three directions to be sin &thgr;, 0, cos &thgr;, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Similarly, we find the direction cosines of the line P&prime;Q in the x&prime;, y&prime; and z directions in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> to be:

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> We now calculate the angles of the rays exiting from the lens. Suppose that in the plane of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the exit ray makes an angle &agr; with the radius OQ. Then, from Snell&apos;s law it follows that: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> If the NA of the collecting lens is finite, only rays with &verbar;&bgr;&verbar;&lt;a sin(NA) can enter the lens. Since &bgr; will depend on x, it follows that if x is sufficiently large in comparison to the diameter of the lens, very little light will enter the collection lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The field of view is also limited by internal reflection in the small lens which is also dependent upon the diameter of the small lens. The rays which leave the small lens are limited by the angle &psgr;. When &psgr;&gt;arc sine(1/n) or sin &psgr;&gt;1/n, where n is the refractive index of the lens, then there is total internal reflection of the ray reaching the lens surface. This effect is independent of the numerical aperture of the objective, and is more dominant for a lens made of a high refractive index material like silicon (n&equals;3.4 and &psgr;<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&equals;17&deg;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The spatial resolution is primarily controlled by three factors: the radius a of the microlens, the maximum collection angle &thgr; of the collector lens (where NA&equals;sin &thgr;), the angle for total internal reflection &psgr;<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>and the maximum emission angle &ggr; of a point on the sample. The latter factor is determined by the size and nature of the source region. For an infinitesimal diameter source &ggr;&rarr;90&deg; and we only consider that case. Wavelength &lgr; is only a consideration if the microlens diameter is much smaller than the wavelength (d&lt;&lt;&lgr;) such that the refracting surface is inside the radiation zone of the source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> We have modeled the relationship between microlens radius and angle with a three-dimensional ray-tracing program. The spatial resolution of the technique is directly proportional to microlens diameter for constant maximum collection and emission angles. Doubling the microlens diameter will double the measured full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of a point source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The microlens as described above will operate in collection mode at any size. However, the ability to resolve sub-wavelength features due to a limited field of view only occurs when the microlens diameter is smaller than a few wavelengths, for instance, for a silicon lens of refractive index 3.4, a&lt;1.5&lgr;. Consider a ray emitted vertically upwards into the spherical lens from a point source a distance x from the center of the lens. The angle &psgr; between the ray and the radius of the lens is given at the point Q on the spherical surface by the relation sin &psgr;&equals;x/a, where a&equals;d/2. If there is total internal reflection at this point, then x/a&equals;1/n. For Si, 1/n&equals;0.29, so x/a&equals;0.29. For points on the spherical surface to the left of the point Q the rays are either totally internally reflected or refracted so they will not enter the objective. On the other hand, for points to the right of the apex, sin &psgr;&lt;1/n and the light will be transmitted. Therefore, approximately half the power is transmitted in this case. Hence, as x can be on either side of the center of the sphere, FWHM&equals;2x&equals;0.58a. More generally, for microlens lenses made of material having a refractive index n, the relationship for the diameter d of the spot within the field of view becomes d&equals;2x&equals;2a/n. Thus, the spot size is proportional to the radius of the lens and inversely proportional to the refractive index n of the lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Thus, the energy from the sample can only enter the collecting aperture from a small region on the sample, limited by the size of the microlens and the numerical aperture of the objective. The diameter of this region is proportional to the radius a of the microlens which, for the observation of wavelength or subwavelength features, must be in the order of a few wavelengths. This diameter d depends primarily on the diameter of the microlens and the thickness of the microlens and, secondly, on the numerical aperture of the objective. Thus, the spot size depends on the field of view of the lens and not on the diffraction limits. Like a pinhole or tapered fiber, the spot size d depends only on the geometry and is smaller than that given by the diffraction limit. Although the foregoing description has been primarily directed to a spherical or hemispherical lens. The collection mode will operate with an aspheric lens or a spherical lens with finite h. In all instances, the curved surface faces the collection lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> There has been provided a collector lens microlens combination for viewing small spots on a surface. The lens combination can be used to measure the temperature in spectroscopy in small regions, since the spot size is proportional to the radius of the lens, and inversely proportional to the refractive index of the lens, and is substantially independent of wavelength. The lens operating in the collection mode can collect energy from a small region which is independent of the wavelength of the energy. Therefore, the lens is suitable for spectral analysis of the absorption or emission from a small region over a range of wavelengths. It is also suitable for measuring thermal emission, particularly in the infrared range from 1 to 100 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thus, the applications for collection imaging include fluorescence microscopy, spectroscopy and thermal imaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to coatings that emit magnetic resonance signals and in particular, to such coatings containing paramagnetic metal ions, and to a process for coating medical devices with such coatings so that the devices are readily visualized in magnetic resonance images during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures done in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Since its introduction, magnetic resonance (MR) has been used to a large extent solely for diagnostic applications. With advancement of magnetic resonance imaging, however, it is becoming possible to replace many diagnostic x-ray imaging applications with MR techniques. For example, the accepted standard for staging vascular disease was, at one time, x-ray contrast angiography. Today, MR angiographic techniques are being increasingly used to detect vascular abnormalities and, in some specific clinical instances, contrast-enhanced MR angiograms are rapidly approaching the diagnostic standard set by x-ray angiography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More recently, advances in MR hardware and imaging sequences have begun to permit the use of MR in certain therapeutic procedures. That is, certain therapeutic procedures or therapies are performed on a patient while the patient and the instruments, devices or agents used and/or implanted are being imaged. The use of MR in this manner of image-guided therapy is often referred to as interventional magnetic resonance (interventional MR). These early applications have included: monitoring ultrasound and laser ablations, guiding the placement of biopsy needles, and visualizing disease, such as tumors, interoperatively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Of particular interest in interventional MR is endovascular therapy. Endovascular therapy refers to a general class of minimally-invasive interventional (or surgical) techniques which are used to treat vascular abnormalities. Unlike conventional surgical techniques, endovascular therapies access and treat the disease from within the vasculature. The vascular system is usually accessed via the femoral artery. A small incision is made in the groin and the femoral artery punctured. A sheath is then inserted for vascular access. A catheter with the addition of a guide-wire can then be manipulated under fluoroscopic guidance to the area of interest. The guide-wire is then removed from the catheter lumen, and either a therapeutic device (e.g., balloon, stent, coil) is inserted with the appropriate delivery device, or an agent (e.g., embolizing agent, anti-vasospasm agent) is injected through the catheter. In either instance, the catheter functions as a conduit and ensures the accurate and localized delivery of the therapeutic device or agent. Once the device or agent is in place, its delivery system is withdrawn, i.e., the catheter is withdrawn, the sheath removed and the incision closed. The duration of an average endovascular procedure is about 3 hours, although difficult cases may take more than 8 hours. Traditionally, such procedures have been performed under x-ray fluoroscopic guidance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Performance of these procedures under MR-guidance provides a number of advantages. Safety issues are associated with the relatively large dosages of ionizing radiation required in x-ray fluoroscopy. While radiation risk to the patient is of somewhat less concern (since it is more than offset by the potential benefit of the procedure), exposure to the interventional staff can be a major problem. In addition, the complication rate from MR contrast agents is much less than the commonly used iodinated x-ray contrast agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other advantages of MR-guided procedures include the ability of MR to acquire three-dimensional images. In contrast, most x-ray angiography systems can only acquire a series of projection images. MR has clear advantages when multiple projections or volume reformatting are required in order to understand the treatment of complex three-dimensional vascular abnormalities, such as arterial-venous malformations (AVMs) and aneurysms. Furthermore, MR is sensitive to a variety of &ldquo;functional&rdquo; parameters including temperature, blood flow, tissue perfusion, diffusion and brain activation. This additional diagnostic information, which, in principle, may be obtained before, during and immediately after therapy, cannot be acquired by x-ray fluoroscopy alone. It is likely that once suitable MR-based endovascular procedures have been developed, the next challenge will be to integrate this functional information with conventional anatomical imaging and device tracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Currently, both &ldquo;active&rdquo; and &ldquo;passive&rdquo; approaches are being used to monitor the placement of interventional devices under MR guidance. With active tracking, visualization is accomplished by incorporating one or more small radio-frequency (RF) coils into the device, e.g., a catheter. The position of the device is computed from MR signals detected by the coil. Later, this information is superimposed on a previously acquired anatomical &ldquo;road map&rdquo; image. The advantages of active tracking include excellent temporal resolution and spatial accuracy, and the ease with which the tip position, e.g., of a catheter, can be updated at 20 Hz, i.e., 20 times per second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, active methods allow visualization of only a discrete point(s) on the device. Typically, only the tip of the device is &ldquo;active&rdquo;, i.e., visualized. Although it is possible to incorporate multiple RF coils (4-6 on typical clinical MR systems) into a device, it is still impossible to determine position at more than a few discrete points along the device. While this may be acceptable for tracking rigid biopsy needles, this is a significant limitation for tracking flexible devices as in endovascular therapy. Furthermore, intravascular heating due to RF-induced currents is a concern with active methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the attachment of coils onto flexible catheters present numerous challenges. Also, the effect on the mechanical properties of catheters is of concern. Ladd et al. (Ladd et al., Proc. ISMRM (1997) 1937) have addressed some of the deficiencies of an active catheter by designing an RF coil that wraps about the catheter. This allows visualization of a considerable length of a catheter, but still does not address the problems of RF heating and mechanical catheter performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Passive tracking technologies use the fact that endovascular devices do not generally emit a detectable MR signal and, thus, result in areas of signal loss or signal voids in MR images. Such signal loss, for example, occurs with a polyethylene catheter. By following the void, the motion of the catheter can be inferred. One advantage of passive tracking methods over active methods is that they do allow &ldquo;visualization&rdquo; of the entire length of a device. Signal voids, however, are certainly not optimal for device tracking because they can be confused with other sources of signal loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A further source of passive contrast occurs if the device has a magnetic susceptibility much different than tissue (e.g., metallic guide-wires and stents). Susceptibility differences cause local distortions to the magnetic field and result in regions of signal enhancement and of signal loss surrounding the device. A number of published reports describe passive catheter visualization schemes based on signal voids or susceptibility-induced artifacts. A principal drawback of the currently available passive techniques is that visualization is dependent on the orientation of the device with respect to the main magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Despite recognition and study of various aspects of the problems of visualization of medical devices in therapeutic, especially endovascular, procedures, the prior art has still not produced satisfactory and reliable techniques for visualization and tracking of the entire device in a procedure under MR guidance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a process for coating medical devices so that the devices are readily visualized, particularly, in T-1 weighted magnetic resonance images.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates broadly to coating substances that are capable of emitting magnetic resonance signals. The present invention is most particularly adapted for use in coating medical devices so that they are readily visualized in magnetic resonance images. Accordingly, the present invention will now be described in detail with respect to such endeavors; however, those skilled in the art will appreciate that such a description of the invention is meant to be exemplary only and should not be viewed as limitative on the full scope thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides coatings containing paramagnetic ions. The coatings of the present invention are characterized by an ability to emit magnetic resonance signals and to permit visualization of the entirety of a device or instrument so coated in interventional MR procedures. The coatings are also of value for providing improved visibility in interoperative MR of surgical instruments after being coated with the signal-enhancing coatings of the present invention. It is also anticipated that the improved visualization of implanted devices so coated, e.g., stents, may find a whole host of applications in diagnostic MR. These attributes of the coating in accordance with the present invention are achieved through a novel combination of physical properties and chemical functionalities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the following description of the method of the invention, process steps are carried out at room temperature (RT) and atmospheric pressure unless otherwise specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Throughout the specification, the term &ldquo;medical device&rdquo; is used in a broad sense to refer to any tool, instrument or other object (e.g., a catheter, biopsy needle, etc.) employed to perform or useful in performing an operation on a target, or a device which itself is implanted in the body (human or animal) for some therapeutic purpose, e.g., a stent, a graft, etc., and a &ldquo;target&rdquo; or &ldquo;target object&rdquo; being all or part of a human patient or animal positioned in the &ldquo;imaging region&rdquo; of a magnetic resonance imaging system (the &ldquo;imaging region&rdquo; being the space within an MRI system in which a target can be imaged). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Of particular interest are endovascular procedures performed under MR guidance. Such endovascular procedures include the treatment of partial vascular occlusions with balloons, arterial-venous malformations with embolic agents, aneurysms with stents or coils, as well as sub-arachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced vasospasm with local applications of papaverine. In these therapeutic procedures, the device or agent is delivered via the lumen of a catheter, the placement of which has traditionally relied on, to varying degrees, x-ray fluoroscopic guidance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of coating the surface of medical devices with a coating which is a polymeric material containing a paramagnetic ion, which coating is generally represented by formula (I): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>P-X-L-M<highlight><superscript>n&plus;</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(I) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> wherein P is a polymer, X is a surface functional group such as an amino or a carboxyl group, L is a chelate, M is a paramagnetic ion which binds to L, and n is an integer that is 2 or greater. It is understood that a medical device may be suitably constructed of a polymer whose surface is then functionalized with X, or a medical device may be suitably coated with a polymer whose surface is then suitably functionalized. Such methods for coating are generally known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> To enhance the rotational mobility of M<highlight><superscript>n&plus;</superscript></highlight>, the coating optionally contains a linker or spacer molecule J, and is generally represented by the formula (II): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>P-X-J-L-M<highlight><superscript>n&plus;</superscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(II) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> wherein P, X, L and M are as described above and J is the linker or spacer molecule which joins the surface functional group X and the chelate L, i.e., J is an intermediary between the surface functional group and the chelate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> P is suitably any polymer including but not limited to polyethylene, polypropylene, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides such as nylon, polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon&trade;) and polyurethanes that can be surface functionalized with an X group. It is noted that some polymer surfaces may need to be coated further with hydrophilic layers. J is suitably a bifunctional molecule, e.g., a lactam having an available amino group and a carboxyl group, an &agr;,&ohgr;-diamine having two available amino groups or a fatty acid anhydride having two available carboxyl groups. X is suitably an amino or carboxyl group. L is suitably any chelate which has a relatively high (e.g., &gt;10<highlight><superscript>20</superscript></highlight>) stability constant, K, for the chelate-paramagnetic ion complex. Such chelates include but are not limited to diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and tetraazacyclo tetradecane tetraacetic acid (TETA). The paramagnetic ion is suitably a multivalent paramagnetic metal including but not limited to the lanthanides and transition metals such as iron, manganese, chromium, cobalt and nickel. Preferably, M<highlight><superscript>n&plus;</superscript></highlight> is a lanthanide which is highly paramagnetic, most preferred of which is the gadolinium(III) ion having seven unpaired electrons in the 4f orbital. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the gadolinium(III) (Gd (III)) ion is often used in MR contrast agents, i.e., signal influencing or enhancing agents, because it is highly paramagnetic having a large magnetic moment due to the seven unpaired 4f orbital electrons. In such contrast agents, gadolinium is generally combined with a chelating agent, such as DTPA. The resulting complex (Gd-DTPA or Magnevist; Berlex Imaging, Wayne, N.J.) is very stable in vivo, and has a formation constant of &gt;10<highlight><superscript>23, </superscript></highlight>making it safe for human use. Similar agents have been developed by chelating the gadolinium ion with other complexes, e.g., MS-325, Epix Medical, Cambridge, Mass. The gadolinium (III) causes a localized T-1 reduction in the protons in its environment, giving enhanced visibility in T-1 weighed MR images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The MR signal-emitting coatings in accordance with the present invention are synthesized according to a three or four-step process. The three-step method includes: (i) plasma-treating the surface of a polymeric material (or a material coated with a polymer) to yield surface functional groups, e.g., using a nitrogen-containing gas or vapor such as hydrazine (NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) to yield amino groups; (ii) binding a chelating agent, e.g., DTPA, to the surface functional group; and (iii) coordinating a functional paramagnetic metal ion such as Gd(III) with the chelating agent. It is noted that the linkage between the surface functional groups and the chlelates is often an amide-type linkage. In addition to hydrazine, other plasma gases which can be used to provide surface functional amino groups include urea, ammonia, a nitrogen-hydrogen combination or combinations of these gases. Plasma gases which provide surface functional carboxyl groups include carbon dioxide or oxygen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A schematic reaction process of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As seen specifically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, polyethylene is treated with a hydrazine plasma to yield surface functionalized amino groups. The amino groups are reacted with DTPA in the presence of a coupling catalyst, e.g., 1,1&prime;-cabonyldiimidazole, to effect an amide linkage between amino groups and DTPA. The surface amino-DTPA groups are then treated with gadolinium (III) chloride, coordinating the gadolinium (III) ion with the DTPA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> To enhance the rotational component of the interaction of the paramagnetic ion with the environmental water, the MR-signal-emitting coatings are suitably made via a four-step process which is similar to the three-step process except that prior to step (ii), i.e., prior to reaction with the chelating agent, a linker agent or spacer molecule, e.g., a lactam, is bound to the surface functional groups, resulting in the coating of formula (II). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> An illustrative schematic reaction process using a lactam is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> polyethylene with an amino functionalized surface is reacted with a lactam. The amino groups and lactam molecules are coupled via an amide linkage. It is noted that &ldquo;m&rdquo; in the designation of the amino-lactam linkage is suitably an integer greater than 1. The polyethylene-amino-lactam complex is then reacted with DTPA which forms a second amide linkage at the distal end of the lactam molecule. The last step in the process, coordinating the gadolinium (III) ion with the DTPA (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), is the same as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Specific reaction conditions for forming a coating in accordance with the present invention, which utilizes surface functionalized amino groups, include plasma treatment of a polymeric surface, e.g., a polyethylene surface, at 50 W power input in a hydrazine atmosphere within a plasma chamber, schematically represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for 5-6 min. at 13 Pa to 106 Pa (100 mT-800 mT). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an exemplary plasma chamber, designated generally by reference numeral <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, includes a cylindrical stainless steel reaction chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> suitably having a 20 cm diameter, a lower electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is grounded, and an upper electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, both suitably constructed of stainless steel. Electrodes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are suitably 0.8 cm thick. Upper electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected to an RF-power supply (not shown). Both electrodes are removable which facilitates post-plasma cleaning operations. Lower electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also forms part of a vacuum line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> through a supporting conical-shaped and circularly-perforated stainless steel tubing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that has a control valve <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The evacuation of chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is performed uniformly through a narrow gap (3 mm) existing between lower electrode <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the bottom of chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Upper electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is directly connected to a threaded end of a vacuum-tight metal/ceramic feedthrough <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which assures both the insulation of the RF-power line from the reactor and the dissipation of the RF-power to the electrodes. A space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> between upper electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the upper wall of chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is occupied by three removable 1 cm thick, 20 cm diameter Pyrex&trade; glass disks <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Disks <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> insulate upper electrode <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from the stainless steel top of the reactor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and allow the adjustment of the electrode gap. The reactor volume located outside the perimeter of the electrodes is occupied by two Pyrex&trade; glass cylinders <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> provided with four symmetrically located through-holes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for diagnostic purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This reactor configuration substantially eliminates the non-plasma zones of the gas environment and considerably reduces the radial diffusion of the plasma species, consequently leading to more uniform plasma exposure of the substrates (electrodes). As a result, uniform surface treatment and deposition processes (6-10% film thickness variation) can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The removable top part of the reactor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> vacuum seals chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the aid of a copper gasket and fastening bolts <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. This part of the reactor also accommodates a narrow circular gas-mixing chamber <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> provided with a shower-type 0.5 mm diameter orifice system, and a gas- and monomer supply connection <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. This gas supply configuration assures a uniform penetration and flow of gases and vapors through the reaction zone. The entire reactor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is thermostated by electric heaters attached to the outside surface of chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and embedded in an aluminum sheet <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> protecting a glass-wool blanket <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to avoid extensive loss of thermal energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> For diagnostic purposes, four symmetrically positioned stainless steel port hole tubings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are connected and welded through insulating blanket <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the reactor wall. These port holes are provided with exchangable, optically smooth, quartz windows <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A vapor supply assemblage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, includes a plasma reservoir <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, valves <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, VCR connectors <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and connecting stainless steel tubing <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Assemblage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is embedded in two 1 cm thick copper jackets <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> provided with controlled electric heaters to process low volatility chemicals. Assemblage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is insulated using a glass-wool blanket coating. The thermostatic capabilities of reactor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are in the range of 25-250&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Once the device to be coated is surface functionalized, it is then immersed in a solution of the chelating agent, e.g., DTPA, in, e.g., anhydrous pyridine, typically with a coupling catalyst, e.g., 1,1&prime;-carbonyidiimidazole, for a time sufficient for the chelate to react with the amine groups, e.g., 20 hours. The surface is washed sequentially with solvents, e.g., pyridine, chloroform, methanol and water. The chelate-treated surface is then soaked in a solution of a salt of the paramagnetic ion, e.g., GdCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>.6H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O in water, for a time sufficient for the paramagnetic ion to react with the chelate, e.g., 12 hours. The surface is then washed with water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In test processes, each step has been verified to confirm that the bonding, in fact, occurs. To verify the amino group functionalization, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used. A XPS spectrum of the polyethylene surface was taken prior to and after plasma treatment. The XPS spectrum of polyethylene before the treatment showed no nitrogen peak. After treatment, the nitrogen peak was 5.2% relative to carbon and oxygen peaks of 63.2% and 31.6%, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> To determine whether the amino groups were accessible for chemical reactions, after step (i) the surface was reacted with p-fluorophenone propionic acid and rinsed with solvent (tetrahydrofuran). This reactant, chosen because of good sensitivity of fluorine atoms to XPS, produces many photoelectrons upon x-ray excitation. The result of the XPS experiment showed a significant fluorine signal. The peaks for fluorine, nitrogen, carbon and oxygen were: 3.2%, 1.5%, 75.7% and 19.6%, respectively. This demonstrated that the amino groups were accessible and capable of chemical reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Because the coatings in accordance with the present invention are advantageously applied to catheters and because a catheter surface is cylindrical, it is noted that to coat commercial catheters, the plasma reaction must be carried out by rotating the catheter axis normal to the plasma sheath propagation direction. Such rotational devices are known and can be readily used in the plasma reactor depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. To verify that surface amination occurs for such surfaces, atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) is used to study the surface morphology because XPS requires a well-defined planar surface relative to the incident X-ray coated, the coating densities (e.g., nmol Gd<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight>/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) are measured using NMR and optimal coating densities can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is also understood that metallic surfaces can be treated with the coatings in accordance with the present invention. Metallic surfaces, e.g., guide-wires, can be coated with polymer, e.g., polyethylene, by various known surface-coating techniques, e.g., melt coating, a well known procedure to overcoat polymers on metal surfaces. Once the metallic surfaces are overcoated with polymer, all other chemical steps as described herein apply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further explained by the following examples which should not be construed by way of limiting the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A polyethylene sheet (4.5 in diameter and 1 mil thick) was placed in a capacitively coupled, 50 kHz, stainless steel plasma reactor (as shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference>A) and hydrazine plasma treatment of the polyethylene film was performed. The substrate film was placed on the lower electrode. First, the base pressure was established in the reactor. Then, the hydrazine pressure was slowly raised by opening the valve to the liquid hydrazine reservoir. The following plasma conditions were used: base pressure&equals;60 mT; treatment hydrazine pressure&equals;350 mT; RF Power&equals;25 W; treatment time&equals;5 min; source temperature (hydrazine reservoir)&equals;60&deg; C.; temperature of substrate&equals;40&deg; C. Surface atomic composition of untreated and plasma-treated surfaces were evaluated using XPS (Perkin-Elmer Phi-5400; 300 W power; Mg source; 15 kV; 45&deg; angle). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a 25 mL dry flask, 21.5 mg of DTPA was added to 8 mL of anhydrous pyridine. In a small vessel, 8.9 mg of carbonyidiimidazole (CDI), as a coupling catalyst, was dissolved in 2 mL of anhydrous pyridine. The CDI solution was slowly added into the reaction flask while stirring, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The solution was then poured into a dry Petri dish, and the hydrazine-plasma treated polyethylene film was immersed in the solution. The Petri dish was sealed in a desiccator after being purged with dry argon for 10 min. After reaction for 20 hours, the polyethylene film was carefully washed in sequence with pyridine, chloroform, methanol and water. The surface was checked with XPS, w and the results showed the presence of carboxyl groups, which demonstrate the presence of DTPA. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Imaging of Coated Polyethylene and Polypropylene Sheets </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> MR signal enhancement was assessed by imaging coated sheets of polyethylene and polypropylene, prepared as described in Example 1, with gradient-recalled echo (GRE) and spin-echo (SE) techniques on a clinical 1.5 T scanner. The sheets were held stationary in a beaker filled with a tissue-mimic, yogurt, and the contrast-enhancement of the coating was calculated by normalizing the signal near the sheet by the yogurt signal. The T1-weighed GRE and SE MR images showed signal enhancement near the coated polymer sheet. The T1 estimates near the coated surface and in the yogurt were 0.4 s and 1.1 s, respectively. No enhancement was observed near control sheets. The MR images acquired are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A Gd-DTPA-filled single lumen catheter 3-6 French (1-2 mm) was imaged in an acrylic phantom using a conventional MR Scanner (1.5T Signa, General Electric Medical Systems) while it was moved manually by discrete intervals over a predetermined distance in either the readout direction or the phase encoding direction. The phantom consisted of a block of acrylic into which a series of channels had been drilled. The setup permitted determination of the tip position of the catheter with an accuracy of &plusmn;1 mm (root-mean-square).

<heading lvl="1">In vivo Testing of Gd-Dtpa-Filled Catheter Visualization </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> For in vivo evaluation, commercially-available single lumen catheters filled with Gd-DTPA (4-6% solution), ranging in size between 3 and 6 French (1-2 mm), and catheter/guide-wire combinations were imaged either in the aorta or in the carotid artery of four canines. All animal experiments were conducted in conjunction with institution-approved protocols and were carried out with the animals under general anesthesia. The lumen of the catheter is open at one end and closed at the other end by a stopcock. This keeps the Gd-DTPA solution in the catheter. The possibility of Gd-DTPA leaking out of the catheter lumen through the open end was small and is considered safe because the Gd-DTPA used in these experiments is commercially available and approved for use in MR. Reconstructed images made during catheter tracking were superimposed on previously acquired angiographic &ldquo;roadmap&rdquo; images typically acquired using a 3D TRICKS imaging sequence (F. R. Korosec, R. Frayne, T. M. Grist, C. A. Mistretta, 36 <highlight><italic>Magn. Reson. Medicine</italic></highlight>. (1996) 345-351, incorporated herein by reference) in conjunction with either an intravenous or intra-arterial injection of Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol/kg). On some occasions, subtraction techniques were used to eliminate the background signal from the catheter images prior to superimposing them onto a roadmap image. Snapshots of the canine carotids and aortas are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, respectively. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Determination of Coating Signal Intensities </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A clinical 1.5 T scanner (Signa, General Electric Medical Systems) is used to determine the optimal range of coating densities (in mmol Gd<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight> m<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>) for producing appreciable signal enhancement on a series of silicon wafers coated with a polyethylene-Gd-containing coating in accordance with the present invention. The wafers are placed in a water bath and scanned cross-sectionally using a moderately high-resolution fast gradient-recalled echo (FGRE) sequence with TR&ap;7.5 ms/TE&ap;1.5 ms, 256&times;256 acquisition matrix and a 16 cm&times;16 cm field-of-view (FOV). The flip angle is varied from 10&deg; to 90&deg; in 10&deg; increments for each coating density. A region of interest (ROI) is placed in the water adjacent to the wafer and the absolute signal is calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> For calibration of signal measurements obtained in different imaging experiments, a series of ten calibration vials is also imaged. The vials contain various concentrations of Gd-DTPA, ranging from 0 mmol mL<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to 0.5 mmol mL<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. This range of concentrations corresponds to a range of T1 relaxation times (from &lt;10 ms to 1000 ms) and a range of T2 relaxation times. The signals in each vial are also measured and used to normalize the signals obtained near the wafers. Normalization corrections for effects due to different prescan settings between acquisitions and variable image scaling are applied by the scanner. A range of concentrations in the vials facilitates piece-wise normalization. An optimal range of coating densities is determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In summary, the present invention provides a method of visualizing medical devices under MR guidance utilizing a coating, which is a polymeric-paramagnetic ion complex, on the medical devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has now been described and exemplified with some specificity, those skilled in the art will appreciate the various modifications, including variations, additions, and omissions, that may be made in what has been described. Accordingly, it is intended that these modifications also be encompassed by the present invention and that the scope of the present invention be limited solely by the broadest interpretation that can lawfully be accorded the appended claims. </paragraph>

It is especially desirable that such light emitting components be on silicon thereby making them compatible with existing silicon-based electronics. Until now, fabrication of such reliable light emitting devices, particularly on silicon has been limited by the ability of the optically active material to withstand thermal stresses associated with device operation. Since the direct band gap semiconductor materials that typically are the optically active material in such devices characteristically have large thermal expansion mismatches with common substrate materials, and especially with silicon, the heating generated during device operation can produce sufficient tensile or compressive stress to rapidly degrade the performance of the optically active material. Likewise, current methods for generating mid-infrared light require steps of cooling the light-emitting devices to cryogenic temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, there exists a need for a method for generating mid-infrared light at temperatures near room temperature including providing a robust, optically active material, preferably one that can be grown directly on a silicon substrate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Mid-infrared light can be generated at a selected temperature at or near room temperature without the need for additional cryogenic components by optically or electrically pumping multiple quantum well materials, fabricated with bandgaps specifically engineered to satisfy particular device design requirements, including light emission at a selected wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment of a multiple quantum well device based on the PbSe/Pb<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Se alloy system. Buffer layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is selected to have a similar lattice structure to that of the alloy system material can be a material such as a PbSrSe, PbSnSe, PbSe, CaF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer or combination thereof, is deposited on substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or other thin film growth technique as would be known to one skilled in the art. Substrate <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be a material such as BaF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Si or PbSe. A BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>substrate offers the advantage of ready availability. Use of a Si substrate enables integration of the optically active material with other electronic circuitry on a single chip. A (100)PbSe substrate allows for ready fabrication of a conventional cleaved cavity laser. It can be cleaved along the (100) directions perpendicular to the substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The optically active material, the quantum well, is formed by depositing a &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structure of a narrow bandgap material, PbSe layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, disposed between two wider bandgap material layers, Pb<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Se layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This individual quantum well &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structure is repeated multiple times, from about 10 to about 70 times, to produce a multiple quantum well (MQW) material. Increasing the number, n, of individual quantum well structures in the MQW material has the effect of increasing the light output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> An optically active MQW structure based on other PbSrZ alloy systems (Sr-containing alloy systems) where Z is S, Se, or Te, or other PbSnZ alloy systems (Sn-containing alloy systems) where Z is S, Se, or Te, can also be fabricated in a manner similar to the schematic representation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Use of the Sn containing alloy system provides a narrower bandgap material which has the advantage of enabling growth of an MQW material that can be used to produce longer wavelength light. Selection of a particular Group VI element such as S, Se or Te within a chosen alloy system allows additional design flexibility in producing a desired wavelength of light emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> schematically illustrates the electronic band structure of an MQW material. Wide bandgap <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> corresponds to the bandgap of wide bandgap material Pb<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Se layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and narrow bandgap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> corresponds to the narrow bandgap of PbSe layer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Electrons and holes are confined between the two wide bandgap layers in the narrow bandgap layer. By selecting the number, n, of individual quantum wells, the relative bandgap widths of the layers making up each quantum well and the relative thicknesses of the layers making up each quantum well, a material having a custom-designed electronic band structure and, with that, custom-designed optical activity can be fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an MQW material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, based on either a Sr-containing or Sn-containing alloy system as already described and fabricated as already described, can be further sandwiched between n-type layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and p-type layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to form MQW-based diode structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The n-type layer can be the electron injection material and the p-type layer can be the hole injection material both having compositions well known to one skilled in the art. Typical thicknesses of the n- and p-type layers are in the range of about 200 nm to about 2000 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Cleaved facets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be made in a plane perpendicular to surfaces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of MQW material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, thereby making MQW-based diode structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> a conventional cleaved cavity laser. Such a laser would be electrically pumped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If n-type layer <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and p-type layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, are absent from the already-described device, a conventional cleaved cavity laser including substrate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and MQW material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that can be optically, instead of electrically, pumped is obtained as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, MQW material <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be disposed between two distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR&apos;s) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to form a conventional vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) structure <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. A VCSEL structure can be fabricated by growing alternating layers of high and low refractive index materials as would be well known to one skilled in the art. When MQW material <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> intervenes between n-type layer <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and p-type layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, an electrically pumped laser is obtained <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows, alternatively, a VCSEL structure without any n-type or p-type layers. The VCSEL structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, including MQW layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and two distributed Bragg reflectors <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, would be optically pumped. Typically, DBR&apos;s <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the MQW material can be grown on silicon substrate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to produce an optically active device as part of an addressable light-emitting circuit element <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Addressable light-emitting circuit element <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> includes electrical contact <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, gate electrode <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, source diffusion <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, drain diffusion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, MQW material <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and electrical contact <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Such a silicon-based light-emitting circuit element can be readily fabricated using techniques well known to one skilled in the art. Light emission shown by arrows <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is through silicon substrate <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows four addressable light-emitting circuit elements <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> combined into 2&times;2 array <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>.

Arrows <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> represent emitted light. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The following example demonstrates a method for obtaining light emission, particularly photoluminescence in the 3-5 micron range, at room temperature using PbSe/PbSrSe multiple quantum well structures. The example also describes the growth and subsequent structural and optical property characterization of the multiple quantum well materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> All structures were grown on BaF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(111) substrates in an Intevac GEN II MBE system. BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>substrates were freshly cleaved from a (111)-oriented 1 cm&times;1 cm ingot and mounted onto a uniblock with a silicon backing plate. Before being transferred to the growth chamber, the substrate was outgassed in the preparation chamber at 200&deg; C. for 1 hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> After the BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>substrate was transferred to the growth chamber, the substrate temperature was ramped up to 550&deg; C. until a sharp BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(1&times;1) reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) pattern appeared. A 100-nm-thick BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>buffer layer was first grown on the substrate at 500&deg; C. The growth temperature was measured using a thermocouple. X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the growth of a BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>buffer layer could reduce the linewidth of (222) diffraction of the subsequently grown PbSrSe layer by 30%-50%. A 3-micron-thick PbSrSe layer was then grown on top of the BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>buffer layer at 360&deg; C. The growth of PbSrSe was carried out by evaporating PbSe and elemental Sr sources. The Sr composition was controlled by varying the Sr to PbSe flux ratio. The actual Sr content was determined from x-ray diffraction measurements. An additional Se source was used to control the stoichiometry of PbSe and PbSrSe layers and keep the surface under Se rich conditions. A valved cracker cell was used to produce a Se flux of 10% relative to the total PbSe and Sr fluxes. The typical beam equivalent pressure of PbSe is about 1.56&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>Torr. The PbSe and PbSrSe growth rates were both about 180 Angstroms/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> To grow a multiple quantum well structure, 10-40 periods of PbSe/PbSrSe were grown on top of the PbSrSe buffer layer at 360&deg; C. The thicknesses of the PbSe quantum well and PbSrSe barrier were in the range of 40-200 and 400-500 Angstroms, respectivelv. To prevent the final PbSrSe layer from being oxidized, a 10-nm-thick PbSe cap layer was grown on top of either a single PbSrSe layer or a PbSe/PbSrSe multiple quantum well structure. All the PbSe and PbSrSe layers were undoped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Growth was monitored in situ using the RHEED technique. Ex situ structural characterization of the epilayers was performed using a Philips high-resolution x-ray diffraction system with a four-crystal Ge (220) monochromator. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmission measurements were carried out using a BioRad spectrometer (FTS-60A) with a wave number range of 500-6000 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed using a modular FTIR spectrometer (Oriel, MIR8000). MBE samples were illuminated with a 972 nm InGaAs laser. The injection current for the InGaAs pump laser was 500 mA producing about 250 mW of power. The unfocused laser, located about 10 mm from the sample at about a 45&deg; angle, produced a spot size of about 2 mm&times;7 mm on the sample surface. An average power density of about 1.8 W/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is thus estimated. The PL setup can readily be constructed by one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an x-ray diffraction rocking curve for a PbSe/PbSrSe multiple quantum well (MQW) structure grown on BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at 360&deg; C. Satellite reflection peaks with the order up to 7 were clearly seen from the MQW sample indicating the high quality of the sample. These data confirm the layered structure of the material and show that the interfaces between the PbSe and PbSrSe layers are smooth and compositionally abrupt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the results of infrared transmission measurements from which the absorption edge or the bandgap energy, E<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>, for each of the layers making up the MQW structure is determined. These data show that bandgap energy increases as Sr content increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows measured spectra along with Gaussian fits to the data for four MQW samples at 5&deg; C. with different quantum-well thicknesses. Each measured spectrum exhibits multiple peaks separated by about 200 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. These are Fabry-Perot interference fringes due to resonance in the optical cavity formed by the layer. Using the equation of n&equals;(2t&Dgr;&ugr;)<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, where n is the index of refraction, t is the measured total film thickness including the 3-micron-thick PbSrSe buffer layer, and Au is the fringe spacing, the average value for the index of refraction for the layers is 4.79. This index of refraction is smaller than the <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> value for the index of refraction of PbSe near its band gap, which is consistent with the fact that most of the optical cavity consists of larger band gap (and thus smaller index) PbSrSe. The appearance of Fabry-Perot interference fringes in the PL spectra shows that there is significant internal reflection inside the layer and indicates that sample luminescence is dominated by stimulated emission processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a plot of the peak energies obtained from Gaussian fits to the measured PL spectra at temperatures ranging from 5&deg; C. to 55&deg; C. as shown on the graph for each sample as a function of quantum well thickness. A shift in the PL emission energy from 312 to 402 meV is observed as the quantum-well thickness is decreased from 200 to 40 Angstroms. With PL energies significantly above the 275 meV room temperature band gap value of bulk PbSe and a strong blueshift with decreasing well width it is clear that this photoluminescence is due solely to recombination of quantum confined electron-hole pairs. Full width half maxima (FWHM) values obtained from the Gaussian fits were 36.3 and 41.3 meV from two samples with 500 Angstrom barriers and 45.6 and 51.0 meV for two samples with 400 Angstrom barriers respectively. There is no correlation between FWHM and the quantum well thickness. Larger peak widths for samples with thinner barriers suggest that the confined states form a miniband and that the amplitudes of the electron and/or hole wave functions are not zero after penetrating a 400-Angstrom-thick barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The foregoing PL spectra results are the only known evidence of mid-infrared light emission obtained above room temperature, at temperatures even as high as 55&deg; C., with continuous-wave near infrared, i.e. a wavelength in the range of from about 0.8 micron to about 3.0 microns, diode laser pumping, and without any type of lock-in amplification or double modulation signal enhancing techniques. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the method of the invention for generating mid-infrared light at temperatures that include room temperature. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> PbSe/Pb<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Se MQW structures were grown on three inch diameter (111)-oriented silicon substrates in an Intevac GEN II modular MBE system. Typical structures consisted of a 20 Angstrom thick CaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer, a 3 micron thick Pb<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Se buffer layer, a 20 to 40 period MQW structure with 10 nm thick wells (PbSe) and 50 nm thick barriers (Pb<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Se) and a 10 nm thick PbSe capping layer to reduce strontium oxidation. The strontium content in the 3 micron thick buffer and 50 nm thick barrier layers was approximately 7% as determined from x-ray diffraction measurements and Vegard&apos;s law. The Sr/PbSe flux ratio during MBE growth of the Pb<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Se layers was 3%. Detailed procedures for CaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and IV-VI semiconductor growth on (111)-oriented silicon substrates as well as of PbSrSe/PbSe MQW&apos;s are known to one skilled in the art. A near-IR diode laser with emission at 976 nm was used to perform the PL measurements according to procedures known to one skilled in the art and as already described in Example 1. For the PL measurements the diode laser was normally incident and about 4 mm away from the sample producing an unfocussed spot size of about 2 mm in diameter. The diode laser injection current was also varied from 300 mA to 800 mA, and this corresponded to an approximately linear variation in pump power (density) from 160 mW (5.1 W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) to 630 mW (20 W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). A single stage thermoelectric cooling (TEC) module was used to stabilize the sample temperature, which was measured with a thermistor placed adjacent to the sample on a copper plate attached to the TEC. All measurements were performed in continuous wave mode and luminescence from the MQW layer was observed through the silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows PL spectra from a IV-VI MQW layer on silicon at temperatures of 15&deg; C., 25&deg; C., and 35&deg; C. for a constant diode laser injection current of 800 mA. Multiple peaks between 300 meV and 420 meV are observed. These peaks, which are due to optical resonance inside the layer, are not as pronounced as those observed in the PL spectra for IV-VI MQW layers grown on BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>substrates. These Fabry-Perot resonance peaks are weaker because of the much smaller refractive index contrast between the IV-VI material (n approximately 5.4) and silicon (n&equals;3.42) as compared to BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(n&equals;1.45). PL peak energies obtained from Gaussian fits, dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, vary linearly from 336.1 meV to 343.7 meV as shown in the inset as the temperature is increased from 15&deg; C. to 35&deg; C. The temperature tuning coefficient for this sample is 0.38 meV/K. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Above room temperature, continuous wave PL spectra have been obtained from several different MQW layers grown on silicon substrates, including a sample with a forty period MQW and a similar dependence of PL energy on PbSe well width is observed as with layers grown on BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as already described in the foregoing Example 1. Additionally, the samples are quite robust and the PL results are highly reproducible even after several temperature cycles and repeated testing with near-IR laser irradiation. No degradation in PL intensity has been observed either due to testing or storage in laboratory air. Strong luminescence has also been observed from MQW structures grown on silicon with approximately 500 nm thick BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layers grown between the CaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer and the Pb<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Se buffer layer. Growth of such structures allows removal of the silicon growth substrate and transfer of the IV-VI layer to a more thermally conductive substrate such as copper by dissolving the BaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>layer with water. The observed mid-infrared emission under a variety of test conditions demonstrates the efficacy of this method for generating mid-infrared light at temperatures including room temperature. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to compositions of matter and methods for the preparation of composite and hybrid polymers and resins in which at least one component is a chemically modified carboxylate-alumoxane. The carboxylate-alumoxanes are chemically bonded into the polymer backbone through reaction of the appropriate functional groups of a polymer precursor with the carboxylate-alumoxane. The method of the present invention can be used to produce polymers with organic and inorganic backbones. The polymers produced according to the invention can be either a thermoset or a thermoplastic and can be prepared by either a condensation polymerization reaction or an addition polymerization reaction. The invention provides for the formation of carboxylate-alumoxane materials prepared by the reaction of carboxylate-alumoxanes with polymer precursors including without limitation: epoxides, phenol-formaldehyde resins, polyamides, polyesters, polyimides, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, quinone-amine polymers, and acrylates. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Condensation polymers are an important class of polymers that are prepared by the reaction of low molecular weight precursors that contain reactive functional groups such as amines, hydroxyls, acid chlorides, anhydrides and carboxylic acids. Polymeric materials prepared by condensation polymers include (but are not limited to) epoxies, phenol-formaldehyde resins, polyurethanes, polyamides, polyesters, polyimides, polycarbonates, quinone-amine polymers and polysulfones. These materials possess a range of properties and their applications are widespread. Another name for the class of materials known as condensation polymers are thermoset polymers. Thermosettable polymers, in general, exist as liquids that, upon heating, undergo reactions to form solid, highly cross-linked polymer matrices. Once formed, thermoset polymers cannot be reformed into different shapes by heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In general, unfilled thermoset polymers tend to be harder, more brittle and not as tough as thermoplastic polymers. Thus, it is common practice to add a second phase (i.e., fillers) to thermosetting polymers to improve their properties. In addition, incorporation of fillers into the polymer matrices also strengthens and stiffens the polymer matrix allowing the polymers to be used in an expanded range of structural applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A common technique for improving the properties of thermoset resins is the use of inorganic fillers (<highlight><italic>Handbook of Fillers and Reinforcements for Plastics </italic></highlight>11-58 (1978); Katz, H. J. and Milewski, J. V., eds.; Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.; New York). Inorganic fillers impart a number of desirable mechanical and barrier properties to the polymer. These properties include improved tensile strength, stiffness, abrasion resistance, dimensional stability and barriers to gases, solvents and water-vapor. As a second phase, the inorganic fillers can also affect other polymer properties such as pot life, cure exotherms, shrinkage, thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, heat deflection temperature, machinability, hardness, compressive strength, flexural strength, impact strength and electrical conductivity. The properties of polymers can also be modified by incorporation of a second organic or polymer phase into the thermoset polymers. For example, epoxy resins are routinely toughened (strengthened) by the incorporation of an elastomeric polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The extent to which the inorganic fillers affect polymer properties is closely associated with the volume fraction of filler incorporated into the polymer, the particle size of the filler and the degree to which the filler is bound to the polymer matrix. Thus, the properties of the filler-modified polymers depend on the size, shape and dispersion uniformity of the inorganic modifier, as well as the degree of interaction between the inorganic modifier and the organic matrix. Therefore, the best performance is achieved with inorganic fillers consisting of small particles that are uniformly dispersed throughout the polymer and interact strongly with the organic matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Until recently, the particle sizes of fillers used to improve polymeric properties have been on the micron length scale or even larger. These dense fillers have relatively low surface areas. The surface area of a filler is one of its more important properties, as the surface area determines the amount of contact and bonding between the polymer and the filler (Katz and Milewski, 1978). The size of the particles also determines the volume fraction that can be obtained with a given filler at a given weight loading. Most of the properties (mechanical and barrier) of filled polymers are directly related to volume fraction (and correspondingly to the particle size) of the fillers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The greatest effect of fillers on the properties of polymer-filler composites appears to occur for fillers possessing dimensions on the nanometer length scale. Nano-particles are ordinarily defined as materials with sizes ranging from 1 nm to 1 &mgr;m. Nano-particles have higher surface areas and at the same weight have higher volume loadings than do larger particles. The total sum of the interactions between filler particles and the polymer are larger for nanometer sized particles than for larger particles. In addition, smaller particles produce smaller stress concentrations in the composite material. Unfortunately, the handling and dispersing of nanometer sized particles can be difficult; for example, small particles rapidly build up large static charges that can lead to the formation of hazardous breathable dusts. Additionally, inorganic oxides are hydrophilic, while most polymers are hydrophobic. This leads to segregation of the two phases and agglomeration of the powders resulting in a decrease in the overall performance of the polymer composite. Hence, it is desired to provide a technique for incorporating advantageous nanoparticle fillers into condensation polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Like condensation polymers, addition polymers are an increasingly important class of polymers and have widespread applications. Addition polymers are prepared by the reaction of a monomer with an unsaturated group. Industrially, addition polymerizations are typically carried out in one of four general ways: in bulk, in solutions, in suspensions, or in emulsions. For the bulk case, only a monomer and polymerization initiator are reacted exothermically to produce polymers such as polystyrene, or poly(vinyl chloride). While this process is usually difficult to control and generates a lower yield polymer, it does have the advantages of producing polymers with high optical clarity and low contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Solution polymerization is similar to bulk polymerization with the simple addition of a solvent medium. The advantage of solution polymerization is that the solvent allows for heat transfer during the reaction, which results in a much higher yield of polymer. The disadvantage of solution polymerization is that solvents must be chosen carefully, as side chain reactions can occur. Solution polymerization, however, is used frequently to polymerize such monomers as vinyl acetate and ethylene. Suspension polymerization, while utilizing a solvent, is much more akin to the bulk polymerization method rather to the solution method, in that droplets of the monomer are suspended in a carrier in which the monomer is insoluble. The carrier allows the advantageous transfer of heat, and the occurrence of unwanted side reactions is drastically diminished. Finally, emulsion polymerization is similar to suspension polymerization with two important differences: (1) the monomer droplet size is smaller, and (2) the initiator is insoluble in the monomer, but soluble in the carrier. This method is chiefly used to polymerize acrylics, poly(vinyl acetate), and numerous other copolymers. The advantage to emulsion polymerization is that the chain length of the monomer can be controlled without regard to reaction rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These different polymerization methods are based on several features associated with addition reactions: (1) the mass of the polymer decreases with increasing temperature and reaction rate, (2) the longer the reaction time, the more monomer is consumed and consequently, the greater the polymeric yield, (3) the reaction time and the molecular weight of the synthesized polymer are unrelated, and (4) the highest molecular weight polymer possible is formed immediately after the reaction begins and does not vary during the remainder of the reaction time. Although the incorporation of fillers into thermoplastic polymers does not provide the same advantages that it does for thermoset polymers, there are nonetheless instances where it is desirable to incorporate fillers into thermoplastic polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In both condensation and addition polymerizations, the performance of the polymer-filler compound is strongly dependent on the strength of the interaction between polymer and filler. There are a number of interactions that can occur between the polymer and the inorganic filler, including van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonding and covalent bonding. The weakest interactions between the polymer and the filler are the van der Waals and dipole-dipole interactions, with hydrogen bonding affording the next strongest interaction. The strongest interaction is obtained through covalent bonding. The polymer-filler covalent bonding interactions are on the order of 30 to 100 times greater than those that can be obtained by hydrogen bonding (G. Whitesides, et al; Articles; <highlight><italic>Molecular Self</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Assembly and Nanochemistry: A Chemical Strategy for the Synthesis of Nanostructures; </italic></highlight>254 Science 1312-1319 (November 1991)). Covalent bonding of the filler particles to the polymer lattice allows better transfer of mechanical loads to the particles, thereby improving the mechanical properties of the resulting polymer-filler compounds. Covalent attachment of the particles to the polymer matrices can also promote toughening of the polymer composite, as numerous bonds must be broken before cracks can propagate through the polymer. It is therefore desirable to identify small size (i.e., nanometer scale) inorganic fillers that can be readily incorporated into polymer matrices through covalent bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Ceramic materials have excellent mechanical properties, such as heat-resistance, wear-resistance and strength, however, they are typically brittle and difficult to form into complex shapes. In addition, the rational chemical design of new ceramics (and inorganic materials in general) is poorly understood (A. MacInnes, et al.; <highlight><italic>Indium tert</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>butylthiolates as Single Source Precursors for Indium </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>II</italic></highlight>) <highlight><italic>Sulfide Thin Films: Is Molecular Design Enough; </italic></highlight>449 Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 95 (1993)). In contrast, organic polymers and resins are readily processed by a variety of methods. Possibly the most important property of organic polymers is the ease with which their physical properties may be modified through synthetic chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> We have previously reported that aluminum-oxide nanoparticles (5 to 80 &mgr;m) can be prepared by the reaction of the mineral boehmite with carboxylic acids. The identity of the carboxylic acid appears to control the size of the nanoparticles. These materials are termed carboxylate-alumoxanes and may be prepared with an almost limitless variety of functional groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The aluminum based sol-gels (Yoldas, B; <highlight><italic>Alumina Gels that Form Porous Transparent AI</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>O</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>; Journal of Material Science 1856-1860 (1975)) formed during the hydrolysis of aluminum compounds belong to a general class of compounds, namely alumoxanes. These materials were first reported in 1958 (Andrianov, K. et al.; <highlight><italic>Synthesis of New Polymers with Inorganic Chairs of Molecules; </italic></highlight>30 Journal of Polymer Science 513-524, (1958)) with siloxide substituents, however, they have since been prepared with a wide variety of substituents on aluminum. Recent work has shown that the structure of alumoxanes resembles a three dimensional cage (Apblett A. et al.; <highlight><italic>Synthesis and Characterization of Triethylsiloxy</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Substituted Alumoxanes: Their Structural Relationship to the Minerals and Boehmite and Diaspore; American Chemical Society </italic></highlight>167-181 (1992) (hereinafter &ldquo;Apblett et al. (1992)&rdquo;) and (Landry, C. et al.; <highlight><italic>Siloxy</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Substituted Alumoxanes: Synthesis from Polydialkylsiloxanes and Trimethylaluminum, and Application as Aluminosilicate Precursors, </italic></highlight>Journal of Materials Chemistry 597-602 (1993))). For example, siloxy-alumoxanes, &lsqb;Al(O)(OH)<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>(OSiR<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, consist of an aluminum-oxygen core structure (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) analogous to that found in the mineral boehmite, &lsqb;Al(O)(OH)&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, with siloxide substituents surrounding the core. In the siloxy-alumoxanes, the &ldquo;organic&rdquo; substituent typically resembles that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, the carboxylate anion, &lsqb;RCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, is an isoelectronic and structural analog of the organic portion found in the siloxy-alumoxanes and is known to act as a bridging ligand across two aluminum centers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), (Koide, Y. et al.; <highlight><italic>Alumoxanes as Cocatalysts in the Palladium</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Catalyzed Copolymetrization of Carbon Monoxide and Ethylene: Genesis of a Structure</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Activity Relationship; </italic></highlight>15 Organometallics 2213-2226 (No. 9, 1996) and Koide, Y. et al.; &lsqb;Al<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>(Bu)<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>(&mgr;<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-O)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(&mgr;-OH)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(&mgr;O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CPh)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&rsqb;: A Model for the Interaction of Carboxylic Acids with Boehmite; </italic></highlight>American Chemical Society 4025-29 (1995)).

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Carboxylate-substituted alumoxanes have been well characterized (Landry et al. 1995 and Callendar, R. et al.; <highlight><italic>Aqueous Synthesis of Water</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Soluble Alumoxanes: Environmentally Benign Precursors to Alumina and Aluminum</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Based Ceramics; </italic></highlight>American Chemical Society 2418-33 (1997) (hereinafter, &ldquo;Callendar et al. (1997)&rdquo;). Solution particle-size measurements show that carboxylate-alumoxanes are nano-particles, with sizes ordinarily ranging from 1-1000 nm. The carboxylate ligand is bound to the aluminum surface, and is only removed under extreme conditions. The carboxylate-alumoxane materials prepared from the reaction of boehmite with carboxylic acids are air and water stable materials that are easily processable. The physical properties of these alumoxanes are highly dependent on the identity of the alkyl substituents, R, and range from those associated with insoluble crystalline powders to powders that readily form solutions or gels in hydrocarbon solvents and/or water. These alumoxanes are indefinitely stable under ambient conditions, and are adaptable to a wide range of processing techniques. The alumoxanes can be easily converted to aluminum oxide upon mild thermolysis, while they also react with metal complexes to form doped or mixed aluminum oxides (Kareiva, A. et al.; <highlight><italic>Carboxylate</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Substituted Alumoxanes as Processable Precursors to Transition Metal</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Aluminum and Lanthanide</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Aluminum Mixed-Metal Oxides: Atomic Scale Mixing via a New Transmetalation Reaction; </italic></highlight>American Chemical Society 2231-2340 (1996) (hereinafter, &ldquo;Kareiva et al. (1996)&rdquo;)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Apblett et al. (1992) describes a method for the synthesis of carboxylate-substituted alumoxanes through the reaction of pseudoboehmite and carboxylic acids in refluxing xylenes. If the carboxylic acid is a heat stable liquid, then the carboxylic acid can be prepared by addition of the pseudoboehmite to the liquid acid with reflux heating for several days. Apblett et al. (1992) describes the synthesis of several alumoxanes using different carboxylic acids (HO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CR, R&boxH;CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>, CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>, CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>OCH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, or C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2n&plus;1 </subscript></highlight>where n&equals;1-3). However Apblett et al. (1992) do not describe the preparation of carboxylate-alumoxanes containing functional groups that can be incorporated into polymer matrices through covalent bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Landry et al. (1995) expand on the synthesis and characterization of carboxylate-alumoxanes including those listed above and additionally describe new carboxylate-alumoxanes prepared using valeric and lauric acids. However, Landry et al. (1995) do not describe the synthesis and use of alumoxanes containing functional groups that can be readily incorporated through chemical bonding to polymer matrices. Kareiva et al. (1996) describe the preparation of carboxylate-alumoxanes and a metal-exchange reaction using metal acetylacetonate compounds to prepare metal exchanged alumoxanes that can be decomposed in air at high temperatures to prepare mixed metal oxides. A detailed discussion of metal-exchanged alumoxanes can be found in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/058,587 filed Apr. 10, 1998 and titled Metal-Exchanged Carboxylato-Alumoxanes, incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The synthesis of two alumoxanes not included by Apblett et al. (1992) and Landry et al. (1995) were included in Kareiva et al (1996). These alumoxanes were prepared by the reaction of pseudoboehmite with methacrylic acid and (methoxyethoxy)ethoxy acetic acid respectively. Although methacrylato-alumoxanes contain a reactive group that could potentially be incorporated into polymers through free radical addition mechanisms, they were used as precursors to the formation of mixed metal oxides and Kareiva at al. (1996) did not discuss the use of these materials as potential candidates for incorporation into polymer matrices. Callender et al. (1997) describe the synthesis of carboxylate-alumoxanes by reactions of carboxylic acids and pseudo-boehmite using water as a solvent. Syntheses of carboxylate-alumoxane from boehmite and the carboxylic acids (methoxyethoxy)ethoxy acetic acid, (methoxyethoxy) acetic acid, methoxy acetic acid and acetic acid were described. However, these materials were prepared to be used as precursors in the production of ceramics and do not contain functional groups that can be used to covalent bond the alumoxanes to a polymer matrix. In summary, the syntheses and uses of carboxylate-alumoxanes cited in the above works were directed towards their use as precursors that are thermally decomposed to provide oxide ceramics and powders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Hence, it is desirable to provide a technique for synthesizing alumoxanes, and in particular carboxylate-substituted alumoxanes, and incorporating them as fillers into various thermosetting and thermoplastic polymers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides methods and materials for covalently bonding nano-sized inorganic fillers comprising alumoxanes into a wide range of polymer matrices. More specifically, the present invention relates to the substitution, completely or partially, of one or more of the constituents of an organic or inorganic polymer system with a carboxylate-alumoxane that is chemically functionalized with appropriate substituents to allow for chemical bonding between the carboxylate-alumoxane and the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The invention describes, and provides methods for the preparation of, carboxylate-alumoxane/polymer composite and hybrid materials through the reactions of amine, hydroxyl, acrylic and vinyl substituted carboxylate-alumoxanes with low molecular weight polymer precursors containing the appropriate reactive functional groups, such as oxiranes, acid chlorides, anhydrides, carboxylic acids, quinones, and olefins. These reactions lead to incorporation of the carboxylate-alumoxanes into the polymer matrix through chemical bonding between the carboxylate-alumoxane and the polymer. In an alternative embodiment, more than one type of substituted carboxylate-alumoxane, with or without additional low molecular weight polymer precursors may be employed, such that the different reactive substituents on each of the substituted carboxylate-alumoxanes react with each other, thus forming chemical bonding between the different carboxylate-alumoxanes and any polymer present.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> This invention discloses the use of amine, hydroxyl and acrylic functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes to prepare alumoxane-polymer composite and hybrid materials. The functionalized alumoxanes are cross-linked with a reactive compound to form a polymeric compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the terms of this invention, it is possible to describe a generic carboxylate-alumoxane/polymer hybrid or composite material to consist of (a) an aluminum oxide nano-particle, (b) a carboxylate group chemically bonded to the aluminum-oxide particle surface, (c) a linkage unit of the carboxylate alumoxane, (d) a chemically reactive substituent, and (e) a reactive compound capable of cross-linking with substituent (d). This structure is represented schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The combination of parts (a) to (c) is referred to herein as a carboxylate-alumoxane. The combination of parts (a) to (d) is herein termed a chemically functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane. Finally, the combination of parts (a) to (e) is the subject of this invention. The reactive compound, which may comprise a polymer precursor, a polymer with reactive groups, or another functionalized alumoxane, cross-links with the alumoxane (a)-(d) to form a polymer backbone. The polymer back-bone may be formed separately from the carboxylate-alumoxane or may contain the carboxylate-alumoxane as one of its constituents. The polymer back-bone can be organic or inorganic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, carboxylate-alumoxanes, also known as carboxylato-alumoxanes, are inorganic-organic hybrid materials that contain a boehmite-like (&lsqb;AlO(OH)&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) aluminum oxygen core (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), to whose surfaces are attached covalently bound carboxylate groups (i.e., RCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, where R&equals;alkyl or aryl group) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) (Landry et al., 1995). The carboxylate groups are tethered to the aluminum-oxygen surface through bidentate bonding of the carboxylate group to two aluminum atoms on the surface of the boehmite particle. The properties and processability of the carboxylate-alumoxanes are strongly dependent on the nature and size of the attached organic groups. Until recently, carboxylate-alumoxanes were not very useful as processable precursors because they were difficult to prepare. Prior to discovery of a new synthetic route (Apblett et al., 1992), carboxylate-alumoxanes were prepared by the reaction of pyrophoric organo-aluminum (e.g., triethylaluminum) with carboxylic acids. (Kimura, Y. et al.; <highlight><italic>Coordination Structure of the Aluminum Atoms of Poly</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Methylaloxane</italic></highlight>), <highlight><italic>Poly</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>Isopropoxylaloxane</italic></highlight>) <highlight><italic>and Poly</italic></highlight>&lsqb;(<highlight><italic>Acyloxy</italic></highlight>)-<highlight><italic>Aloxane&rsqb;; </italic></highlight>9 Polyhedron 371-76, No. 23 (1990)) and (Pasynkiewicz, S.; <highlight><italic>Alumoxanes: Synthesis, Structures, Complexes and Reactions; </italic></highlight>9 Polyhedron 429-53, No. 2/3 (1990)). The high cost of the organometallic compounds and the difficulty of handling highly reactive materials provided a high barrier to the use of carboxylate-alumoxanes as materials for improving the properties of thermoset polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The preferred carboxylate-alumoxanes of the present invention are prepared by the reaction of boehmite or pseudoboehmite with carboxylic acids in a suitable solvent. In addition to the carboxylate groups, the carboxylic acids also contain terminal amine, hydroxyl or acrylic groups. A representative sample of suitable carboxylic acids is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The boehmite (or pseudoboehmite) source can be a commercial boehmite product such as Catapal (A, B, C, D, or FI, Condea-Vista Chemical Company), boehmite prepared by the precipitation of aluminum nitrate with ammonium hydroxide and then hydrothermally treated at 200&deg; C. for 24 hours, or boehmite prepared by the hydrolysis of aluminum trialkoxides followed by hydrothermal treatment at 200&deg; C. Preferred methods for the preparation of the pseudoboehmite or boehmite particles are those that produce particle sizes of the carboxylate-alumoxanes below 1000 nm and more preferably below 100 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The reaction of the pseudoboehmite (or boehmite) with the carboxylic acid can be carried out in either water or a variety of organic solvents (including, but not limited to toluene and xylene). However, it is preferable to use water as the solvent so as to the minimize the production of environmentally problematic waste. In a typical reaction, the carboxylic acids are added to boehmite or pseudoboehmite particles, the mixture is heated to reflux, and then stirred for a period of time. The water is removed and the resulting solids are collected. The solids can be re-dispersed in water or other solvents in which the alumoxane and other polymer precursor components are soluble. It is not necessary to remove the water if the functionalized alumoxanes are to be used in waterborne resin-based polymerization reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The carboxylic acid can be any monocarboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid can be aromatic or aliphatic, and can contain hetero-atom functional groups such as hydroxyls, amines, etc. The solubility of the carboxylate alumoxanes is dependent only on the identity of the carboxylic acid residue, which is almost unrestricted according to the present invention, providing it contains a reactive substituent that reacts with the desired co-reactants. The solubilities of the carboxylate-alumoxanes are therefore readily controllable, so as to make them compatible with any desired co-reactants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> While these advantages are significant, the carboxylate-alumoxanes have additional benefits with respect to large scale production of ternary and quaternary ceramics. The most dramatic of these is the simplicity of the alumoxane methodology. The alumoxane route is simple, and can be halted and/or modified at any stage without significant effects on the products. A careful control of pH, the use of additives to inhibit precipitation, and slow concentration steps are not required, thus making the alumoxane route easier and quicker than prior art techniques. Another benefit with respect to large scale processing is the relatively low cost of the alumoxane precursors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Alumoxane-polymer condensation polymer composites that can be produced in accordance with the present invention include, without limitation, epoxies, phenol-formaldehyde resins, polyamides, polyesters, polyimides, polycarbonates polyurethanes and quinone-amine polymers. In addition, we describe the incorporation of acrylic and alkene substituted carboxylate-alumoxanes such as methacrylate-alumoxane in polyacrylate and polyolefin composites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To prepare the aromatic hydroxyl substituted carboxylate-alumoxanes, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid or diphenolic acid (4,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)valeric acid) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) were added to the pseudoboehmite/boehmite sol and stirred with heating. In practice, any aromatic ring containing a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid can be used to prepare an aromatic hydroxyl functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane. To prepare the aliphatic hydroxyl substituted carboxylate-alumoxanes, dimethylolpropionic acid (2,2-bis-(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) was added to an aqueous pseudo-boehmite/boehmite sol and stirred with heating. In practice, any aliphatic carboxylic acid containing a hydroxyl group can be used to prepare an aliphatic hydroxyl alumoxane. To prepare aromatic amine substituted carboxylate-alumoxanes, 4-aminobenzoic acid was added to an aqueous pseudo-boehmite/boehmite sol and stirred with heating. In practice, any aromatic ring containing a primary or secondary amine and a carboxylic acid can be used to prepare an aromatic amine functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane. To prepare aliphatic amine substituted carboxylate-alumoxanes, 6-aminohexanoic acid or 2,6-diaminohexanoic were added to an aqueous pseudo-boehmite/boehmite sol and stirred with heating. In practice, any aliphatic carboxylic acid containing a primary or secondary amine group can be used to prepare an aliphatic amine alumoxanes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The carboxylate-alumoxanes containing functionalized carboxylic acids were then incorporated into a range of polymer matrices by reaction of the aliphatic and aromatic amines and aliphatic and aromatic hydroxyls with reactive groups of a number of low molecular weight polymer precursors. The preparation of the alumoxane-polymer composites are described in the following paragraphs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The aliphatic and aromatic amine alumoxanes and the aliphatic and aromatic hydroxyl alumoxanes were reacted with a range of low molecular weight polymer precursors to form alumoxane-polymer composites having epoxy, phenol-formaldehyde resin, polyamide, polyester, polyimide, polycarbonate, polyurethane and quinone-amine polymer matrices. In general, the aliphatic and aromatic amine alumoxanes and the aliphatic and aromatic hydroxyl alumoxanes were dispersed into a solvent containing the low molecular weight polymer precursors and any additional components including, but not limited to: catalysts, defoamers, stabilizers, and initiators. The temperature was then increased to initiate cross-linking and to cause the composite material to polymerize and solidify. For some materials it was not necessary to composite material to polymerize and solidify. For some materials it was not necessary to supply any external heat, since the polymerization reaction could be carried out at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Epoxy resins are widely used thermoset materials with significant applications in electronics packaging, coatings and as structural materials. Epoxy resins are easily extruded and/or molded, have moderate strength, and low hardness (Stevens, M. P.; <highlight><italic>Polymer Chemistry </italic></highlight>374-79; Oxford University Press, (1990)). Epoxy resins generally consist of two parts: a resin and a hardener. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a schematic representation of the formation of a two part epoxy resin via the reaction of a bi-functional oxirane (resin) and hydroxyl or amine containing compound (cross-linking agent, also called the hardener). The resin component is commonly a low molecular weight bi-functional oxirane (i.e., epoxide ring containing). The hardener contains a cross-linking agent, which is also a low molecular weight compound having active hydrogens (e.g. hydroxyls or amines). The materials used most often for reaction with the oxirane ring are primary and secondary amines and hydroxyl groups (Tess, R. W.; <highlight><italic>Epoxy Resins Chemistry and physics of Modern Material, </italic></highlight>Intertext (1973)); (McAdams, L. V. and Gannon, J. A.,; 6 <highlight><italic>Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering </italic></highlight>322-82 (1985)); (Ellis, B., editor; <highlight><italic>Chemistry and Technology of Epoxy Resins; </italic></highlight>Ch. 1, 2, 4, and 7; Blackie Academic and Professional (1993)). Although the application of temperature may be sufficient to cause cross-linking between the epoxy and the amines or hydroxyls, catalysts such as basic tertiary amines are commonly used to initiate and accelerate the cross-linking reaction. Alternatively, the reaction can be catalyzed by photolysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Using such epoxy resin systems, three generic classes of alumoxane-based materials are possible. First, a chemically functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane may be incorporated as an additional cross-linking agent into an existing resin/hardener system. Such an alumoxane-based material is termed herein a &ldquo;composite material.&rdquo; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a schematic representation of a composite material formed by the partial replacement of an existing cross-linking agent with a chemically functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane. Second, the chemically functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane may be used in place of the cross-linking agent. Such a alumoxane-based material is termed herein a &ldquo;hybrid material.&rdquo; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a schematic representation of a hybrid material formed from the use of a chemically functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane as the cross-linking agent. Third, two different chemically functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes can partially or completely replace both the resin and hardener. Such an alumoxane-based material is termed herein a &ldquo;bis-alumoxane material.&rdquo; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows two schematic representations of two types of bis-alumoxane materials formed by the use of two chemically functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes as the resin and cross-linking agent respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> We have prepared carboxylate-alumoxane/epoxy hybrid materials through the reaction of amine and hydroxyl functionalized alumoxanes with commercially available epoxy resin components. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a simplified schematic of the reaction between the hydroxy functionalized alumoxane and an epoxy resin (Dow Chemical&apos;s DER 332) to form the alumoxane-epoxy hybrid material. Since the carboxylate-alumoxane surface is covered with the hydroxy-functionalized carboxylate groups, the carboxylate-alumoxane provides three-dimensional cross-linking with the polymer matrix. Hydroxyl functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes that have been used to prepare the carboxylate-alumoxane/epoxy polymer hybrid materials include 4-hydroxybenzenato-alumoxane, diphenolato-alumoxane and dimethylol-propionato-alumoxane. It is also possible to prepare carboxylate-alumoxane-epoxy hybrid materials using amine functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes. Both aromatic and aliphatic amines can be used in the preparation of the carboxylate-alumoxane-epoxy hybrid material. Amine functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes that have been used to prepare the alumoxane-epoxy polymer composites include 6-aminohexanote-alumoxane, 2,6-diaminohexanate-alumoxane and 4-aminobenzenate-alumoxane. The use of aliphatic amine functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes allows fabrication of alumoxane-epoxy composites at or near room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Although we have demonstrated the formation of alumoxane-epoxy composites using commercial resins such as Dow Chemical&apos;s DER 332, combinations of DER 332 and DER 732, Union Carbide&apos;s ERL (a cycloaliphatic resin), and Shell&apos;s EPI-REZ (a waterborne resin system), any commercially available epoxy resin can be used to prepare the carboxylate-alumoxane/epoxy polymer hybrid materials. To those skilled in the art, the reaction between any amine (primary or secondary) functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane or hydroxyl functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane and a resin containing an oxirane ring would lead to the formation of a carboxylate-alumoxane-epoxy polymer hybrid material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Several alternative methods may be employed to prepare carboxylate-alumoxane/hybrid materials, however, in a typical method a mixture of an epoxy resin and a chemically-functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane is formed in a ratio appropriate for the specific chemically-functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane used and in a quantity that mirrors that of the desired final hybrid material. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a schematic representation of the synthesis of a carboxylate-alumoxane/epoxide hybrid material. The set time may be determined by a number of methods, however, one of ordinary skill in the art will be able to develop alternate methods. A representative example of set time determination follows. Given that some epoxy resins are solid or highly viscous at room temperature, the resins should be gently warmed, in a temperature controlled water bath to melt. When the epoxy is mobile, the canister of epoxy is removed from the bath and placed under a mechanical stirrer equipped with a curled steel rotor. With vigorous stirring (ca. 700-1000 rpm) the chemically-functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane should be added and thoroughly mixed. As quickly as possible, the canister should be returned to the water bath, and a temperature sensor added. (A suitable temperature sensor would be a thermocouple.) The temperature should be carefully monitored with time. This temperature-time data can be used to determine mixing times for the final, molded, resin product. The maximum set-time for the studied system occurs at the peak in the exotherm data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In order to allow for physical testing of the carboxylate-alumoxane modified resins uniform samples (6&Prime;&times;6&Prime; and 1 mm thick) can be produced using a simple mold consisting of two aluminum plates of reasonable thickness that have been tapered on one edge of one side so that when the two plates are placed together, with the tapers adjoining, a sort of funnel cavity is formed. A single flat rubber gasket fits around the edges and corners of three of the four sides of the mold (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) such that the thickness of the gasket determines the thickness of the molded piece. The mold is cleaned using a razor blade to remove any particles remaining from previous use, and then scrubbed in opposing directions with a fine-grain steel wool pad. The plates are wiped with a cotton towel to remove any loose aluminum powder. Once prepared, the plates should be coated with an anti-sticking film such as Dexter Brand Frekote. Once the anti-stick coating has dried, the gasket is placed on one of the plates so as not to obstruct the tapered opening and the matching plate placed on top of the &ldquo;sandwich.&rdquo; C-clamps or similar means can be used to hold the mold together. An appropriate amount of warmed epoxide resin is placed into a disposable beaker and placed under a mechanical stirrer fitted with a curled steel rotor. The time allowed for the total resin preparation is calculated based on the set-time (see above) minus about 3 minutes. When ready, the carboxylate-alumoxane should be added, and mixed thoroughly with the epoxy system. Once the materials are combined, the resin system is degassed by placing the mixture under a vacuum. As the pressure over the resin drops, a foam forms. After a few minutes the mixture will eventually cease to foam. Once the resin is degassed, it is poured into the mold, and the mold stored in an upright position at the cure temperature. Once the cure has completed, the mold is carefully separated. The resulting carboxylate-alumoxane/epoxy hybrid material can then be removed from the mold. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Carboxylate-alumoxane/epoxy composite materials can be prepared through the reaction of an amine and a hydroxyl functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane with a commercially available epoxy resin system, or through the reaction of an amine and a hydroxyl functionalized alumoxane with commercially available epoxy resin components in the presence of an organic cross-linking agent (e.g., ethylenediamine). The composite resins are prepared from a mixture of the appropriate carboxylate-alumoxane with a commercial resin system, such as Resin Services HTR-212 resin. Alternatively, composite resins may also be prepared from a mixture of the appropriate carboxylate-alumoxane with a commercial epoxide and an organic cross-linking agent such as ethylenediamine (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NCH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Since it is desired that incorporation of the carboxylate-alumoxanes into the polymer matrix through covalent bonding will lead to improvement in the properties of the carboxylate-alumoxane/polymer composite, we illustrate the improvement of some of the properties of carboxylate-alumoxane/epoxy polymer composites. The improvements in the properties do not imply that these are the maximum or optimal improvements that could be obtained or that incorporation of carboxylate-alumoxanes into the polymers is limited to the properties illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Carboxylate-alumoxane/epoxy composite materials containing a range of carboxylate-alumoxane to polymer precursor ratios were prepared using 4-hydroxybenzoate-alumoxane (HBA), Dow Chemical&apos;s DER 332 epoxy resin and Tone 0305 (a triol from Union Carbide). Resins were prepared using the ratios shown in Table 1. The various formulations were then cured and machined into test shapes. Rectangular bars of each epoxy formulation (with approximate dimensions of 0.125&times;0.125&times;1.2 inches) were machined and then subjected to a three point bend test to determine the flexural strength of the materials. The alumoxane-epoxy composites demonstrated better performance than the alumoxane-free epoxy resin. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows a plot of flexural strength versus carboxylate-alumoxane loading for an carboxylate-alumoxane/epoxy materials. The alumoxane-free epoxy (Example 30) alone had a strength of 51 MPa, the triol plus 14 phr HBA (Example 31) had a strength of 73 MPa and the 26 phr HBA-alumoxane cured epoxy (no triol, Example 32) had a flexural strength of 97 MPa. These results indicate that the strength of the epoxy increases by almost 90% with the introduction of 26% (w/w) of the alumoxane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The dimensional stability of the alumoxane-epoxy composites was also compared to the alumoxane-free epoxies. The results of the dimensional stability studies indicate that the incorporation of the alumoxanes into the epoxy polymer matrix improves the dimensional stability of the epoxy matrix. Up to 300&deg; C., the 4-HBA-alumoxane-epoxy composite material distorts by less than 1%, while the alumoxane-free epoxy distorts by more than 2% at temperatures less than 100&deg; C. and by more than 5% at temperatures up to 300&deg; C. Clearly, the incorporation of the HBA-alumoxane into the polymer matrix results in a material with very good dimensional stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Phenol-formaldehyde (phenolic) resins are the most widely used of the thermosetting resins. The primary use of phenolic resins is as an adhesive in the manufacture of plywood. Phenolic resins are condensation products between phenol (or resorcinol) and formaldehyde. Phenolic-alumoxane polymer composites were prepared by reacting 4-hydroxybenzoate-alumoxane with an excess of formaldehyde in an aqueous solution. The reaction was carried out in water using sodium carbonate as the base catalyst. A hard solid material was produced by heating the mixture to temperatures between 90 and 100&deg; C. To those skilled in the art, fabrication of alumoxane phenolics could also be prepared through the reaction of dihydroxybenzoate-alumoxanes and formaldehyde. Polyamides (or nylons) were among the first synthetic high polymers to be made and used on a large scale. There are four principal methods used in the synthesis of polyamides. These methods include: 1) the reaction between a dicarboxylic acid and a diamine; 2) the dehydration condensation of an amino acid; 3) the reaction between an acid dichloride and a diamine; 4) the ring opening polymerization of cyclic amides. To demonstrate that an alumoxane-polyamide composite could be formed we chose to use the reaction between an amine containing alumoxane (2,6-diaminohexanato-alumoxane) and an acid dichloride (phthaloyl chloride). The 2,6-diaminohexanato-alumoxane was dispersed into water and phthaloyl chloride in dichloromethane was added carefully to the aqueous solution. At the interface between the water and the dichloromethane a rubbery material was formed by the reaction of the amine functionalized alumoxane and the phthaloyl chloride. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows a simplified schematic of the reaction chemistry between the alumoxane and the acid dichloride to form the polyamide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The progression of the reaction may be followed by FTIR and as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. The conversion of the acid chloride to the amide was evidenced by the disappearance of the absorbance at 1789 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>(the acid chloride carbonyl) and the appearance of the amide I band at 1689 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. Although the preparation of an aliphatic polyamide was demonstrated, those skilled in the art will recognize that aromatic polyamide carboxylate-alumoxanes can be prepared by the reaction of the phthaloyl chloride with a carboxylate-alumoxane containing an aromatic amine. Thus reaction of 4-aminobenzenate-alumoxane with phthaloyl chloride would result in the formation of a carboxylate-alumoxane/aromatic polyamide composite. Furthermore, the reaction between any amine (primary or secondary) functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes and any dicarboxylic acid or acid dichloride will result in the formation of carboxylate-alumoxane/polyamide hybrid and composite materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Polyimides are polymers formed by condensation reactions between dianhydrides and diamines. Polyimides represent an important class of high-temperature, solvent-resistant polymers. Typical uses for polyimides include electronics, sleeve bearings, valve seatings and as the matrix component of graphite composites used in numerous aerospace applications. The first preparative step involves condensation of an aromatic dianhydride and an aromatic diamine to form an intermediate poly(amic acid). Dehydration of the poly(amic acid) at higher temperatures leads to the formation of the polyimide structure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows the reaction components used to form a polyimide designated PMR-15. Using a synthetic approach that is similar to the preparation that is used to synthesize PMR-15 we have prepared a carboxylate-alumoxane polyimide. The carboxylate-alumoxane polyimide was prepared by the reaction of 4-aminobenzanoate-alumoxane with BTDE and NE. To a solution of the 4-aminobenzenoate-alumoxane in methanol was added a solution of BTDE in methanol and heated to reflux for an hour. NE in methanol was then added to the mixture and the methanol was then removed from the mixture. The resulting powder was heated to 320&deg; C. using a four step temperature ramp. The formation of the alumoxane polyamide was verified by observation of FTIR absorptions at 1785 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and 1710 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>that show the presence of the imide bond. To those skilled in the art, the preparation of carboxylate-alumoxane polyimides would also be possible by reaction of any aromatic amine functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane and the appropriate aromatic dianhydride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Thermosetting polyesters are widely used in the fabrication of moldings, laminate or reinforced structures, surface gel coatings, liquid castings and furniture. Polyesters are prepared by the condensation of diols with dicarboxylic acids. The polyesters can also be formed by the reaction of diols with derivatives of carboxylic acids such as methyl esters and acid dichlorides. The preparation of a carboxylate-alumoxane polyester was carried out by reaction of a diphenolate-alumoxane with phthaloyl chloride as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. In this reaction diphenolic acid alumoxane and sodium hydroxide were dispersed into distilled water and the sodium salt of benzene sulfonic acid in water was added to the mixture with stirring. Phthaloyl chloride was then added with vigorous stirring. After approximately 15 minutes, the solution became cloudy, and was added to cold acetone. The resulting precipitate was washed several times with cold water. Formation of the carboxylate-alumoxane polyester was shown by the appearance of the ester peak absorption at 1744 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>in the product of the reaction between the diphenolato-alumoxane and the phthaloyl chloride. The formation of carboxylate-alumoxane polyesters is not limited to the two reagents described above. The carboxylate-alumoxane polyesters can also be prepared using a dicarboxylic acid or the methyl ester of a carboxylic acid and any hydroxyl functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Polycarbonates are a class of polyesters derived from carbonic acid (HO)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C&equals;O (i.e., &lsqb;ROC(O)O&rsqb;<highlight><superscript>2&minus;</superscript></highlight>). The most widely synthesized and used polycarbonates are those prepared by the reaction of bisphenol A with either organic carbonate or phosgene gas. The widespread use of polycarbonate is due to its good balance of properties, such as high clarity, toughness, high heat deflection temperatures and dimensional stability. Polycarbonate carboxylate-alumoxane was prepared from the reaction of diphenylcarbonate with 4-hydroxybenzoate-alumoxane. These two materials (and a base catalyst) were slowly heated in a heat taped, thick-walled glass tube under a dynamic vacuum. As the reaction proceeded, a liquid was collected in the cold trap protecting the vacuum pump. This material was identified by FTIR to be the phenol byproduct produced from the reaction of diphenylcarbonate and the 4-hydroxybenzoate-alumoxane. After additional heating, the reaction mixture was cooled and the resulting product was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra showed the presence of C&mdash;O stretching bands at 1225 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and a strong C&equals;O stretching band at 1775 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The alumoxane polycarbonate can also be prepared by the reaction of hydroxybenzoate-alumoxanes with phosgene gas or organic carbonates other than phenyl carbonate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Polyurethanes are a class of materials that are prepared by the reaction of bischloroformates or diisocyanates with diols. Polyurethanes are widely used as elastic fibers, foams, and coatings. Carboxylate-alumoxane polyurethanes were prepared by the reaction of methylene bis-(4,4&prime;-phenelene diisocyanate) (MDI) with hydroxyl functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes. The reaction of either diphenolate-alumoxane or dimethylolpropionato-alumoxane with DMI resulted in the formation of a polyurethane containing a covalently bonded carboxylate-alumoxane. To prepare the alumoxane-polyurethane MDI was dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). A separate suspension of dimethylolpropionate-alumoxane mixed with dimethyl sulfoxide was prepared and the slurry added to the MDI solution. The mixture was heated to reflux until the formation of the polyurethane was achieved. The formation of the carboxylate-alumoxane/polyurethane polymer composite was followed by FTIR. As formation of the carboxylate-alumoxane/polyurethane progressed, the disappearance of the isocyanate absorption at 2262 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>was observed. Alumoxane-polyurethanes can also be prepared by the reaction of any hydroxyl functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane with any diisocyanate or through the reaction of any amine functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane with bisdichloroformate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Quinone amine polymers are prepared by a condensation reaction of diamines with quinones. Quinone amine polymers have been shown to adhere to metals and to displace water from metal surfaces and have thus been investigated as coatings. Quinone-amine carboxylate-alumoxane polymer composites have been prepared by the condensation reaction between benzoquinone and amine functionalized carboxylate-alumoxanes. To prepare the quinone-amine carboxylate-alumoxanes, 2,6-diaminohexanoate-alumoxane in ethanol was added to a mixture of benzoquinone in ethanol and heated at reflux for 4 hours. Most of the ethanol was then removed under reduced pressure with the resulting slurry dropped in cold water to precipitate the quinone-amine carboxylate-alumoxane polymer composite. The progress of the condensation reaction was followed by FTIR. The FTIR spectrum shows the change of absorption from a primary amine (1585 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>) to a secondary amine (1465 cm-1) as the condensation reaction proceeded. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows a simplified reaction schematic of the reaction between an amine functionalized alumoxane and benzoquinone. Quinone-amine carboxylate-alumoxane composites can be prepared by the reaction of any aliphatic amine functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane with benzoquinone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Although it is desirable for the interaction of the carboxylate-alumoxane with the polymer matrix to be based upon covalent bonding, other chemical bonding interactions are also possible. Hydrogen bonding, acid-base interactions and charge transfer interactions are alternatives. As an example, an aqueous solution of urea was heated with 4-hydroxybenzoate-alumoxane. The resulting pale yellow, creamy smooth liquid was poured in a mold and heated at 90&deg; C. to form a hard solid. Those skilled in the art would recognize that carboxylate-alumoxane/polymer material could also be prepared by the reaction of any hydroxyl or amino functionalized carboxylate-alumoxane with any suitable hydrogen bonding molecule or polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A major class of thermoplastics are the polyacrylics and polyolefins. Unlike the materials discussed above, these are ordinarily prepared via addition polymerization rather than condensation polymerization. Polyacrylic carboxylate-alumoxane polymer composites have been prepared by the addition reaction between methylmethacrylate and methacylic acid functionalized alumoxanes. Alternatively, methacrylate-alumoxane and benzoyl chloride may be reacted in the presence of methacrylic acid to produce a brittle white solid. The FTIR spectrum of the washed polymer shows the absorption of the methacrylic acid carbonyl at 1697 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and the alumoxane at 1589 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The peak at 1633 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and 1648 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>due to the monomer double bond absorption has disappeared in the polymer spectrum. </paragraph>

The carboxylate-alumoxane derived resins have increased hardness and toughness. The carboxylate-alumoxanes are presumed to inhibit crack propagation through crack bridging. The carboxylate-alumoxane resins can be used to improve the abrasion- and scratch-resistance of resins. The presence of the carboxylate-alumoxane has been demonstrated to reduce cure time and cure temperature. The carboxylate-alumoxane resins have desirable barrier properties, including an electrical resistance of 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;. The carboxylate-alumoxane resins also may have desirable optical properties compared to the purely organic resins, including: controllable refractive index and fluorescence.

These reactions lead to incorporation of the carboxylate-alumoxanes into the polymer matrix though covalent bonding between the carboxylate-alumoxane and the polymer. Carboxylate-alumoxane polymer materials that can be prepared by reaction of the carboxylate-alumoxane with polymer precursors include without limitation: epoxies, phenol-formaldehyde resins, polyamides, polyesters, polyimides, polycarbonates, polyurethanes and quinone-amine polymers. Similarly, alumoxanes incorporating additional metals (metal-exchanged alumoxanes) can replace the alumoxanes of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Metathesis catalysts have been previously described by for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,312,940, 5,342,909, 5,728,917, 5,750,815, 5,710,298, and 5,831,108 and PCT Publications WO 97/20865 and WO 97/29135 which are all incorporated herein by reference. These publications describe well-defined single component ruthenium or osmium catalysts that possess several advantageous properties. For example, these catalysts are tolerant to a variety of functional groups and generally are more active than previously known metathesis catalysts. Recently, the inclusion of an N-heterocyclic carbene (NIC) ligand, such as an imidazolidine or triazolylidene ligand as described in U.S. Application Nos. 09/539,840, 09/576,370 and PCT Publication No. WO 99/51344, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference, in these metal-carbene complexes has been found to improve the already advantageous properties of these catalysts. In an unexpected and surprising result, the shift in structure from the well-established penta-coordinated catalyst structure to the hexacoordinated catalyst structure has been found to significantly improve the properties of the catalyst. For example, these hexacoordinated catalysts of the present invention exhibit increased activity and selectivity not only in ring closing metathesis (&ldquo;RCM&rdquo;) reactions, but also in other metathesis reactions including cross metathesis (&ldquo;CM&rdquo;) reactions, reactions of acyclic olefins, and ring opening metathesis polymerization (&ldquo;ROMP&rdquo;) reactions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The hexacoordinated complex provides several advantages over the well-known pentacoordinated complexes. For example, the hexacoordinated complexes have greater air stability in the solid state because they are coordinatively saturated. Due to the lability of the additional ligand, e.g. pyridines, the complexes initiate faster than the phosphine based pentacoordinated species. Slow initiation means that only a small amount of complex is actually catalystically active thereby wasting much of the added complex. With faster initiators, catalyst loading is lowered. Further, and without being bound by theory, it is believed that the slower propogation of the hexacoordinated complexes, due to the re-binding of the labile ligands relative to the phosphines, translates to lower polydisperity. Moreover, the coordinatively saturated species crystallize better than their pentacoordinated counterparts. In addition, due to the lability of the ligands in the hexacoordinated complexes (e.g. pyridines and chlorines), these complexes allow access to previously inaccessible complexes and provide with higher purity certain complexes that can be obtained through different routes. For example, the pentacoordinated benzylidene with triphenylphosphine as its phosphine ligand can be prepared in higher yield and with greater purity using the hexacoordinated complex. The pentacoordinated benzylidene with P(p-CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>as its phosphine ligand is inaccessible through existing routes. Without being bound by theory, it is believe that this is because it would require the substitution of a stronger donor ligand with a weaker donor ligand. Substitution of the anionic ligands of the hexacoordinated complexes is much more rapid than with the corresponding pentacoordinated species (e.g. phosphine bound). Without being bound by theory, it is believed that this results from the requirement of ligand dissociation before anionic ligand substitution. Thus complexes with fast dissociation of their neutral electron donor ligands will undergo faster substitution. </paragraph>

This approach relates to the thermal generation of a NHC ligand from a stable (protected) NHC derivative with a release of a quantity of A-B. One of the more preferred methods to generate a reactive NHC ligand is to employ a stable carbene precursor where the A-B compound is also a reactive NHC ligand. A detailed description of the protected NHC and related methods of synthesis and use can be seen in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/278,311 and 60/288,680, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Several structural isomers of the bis-pyridine adduct can be envisioned, but the solid-state structure reveals that the pyridines bind in a cis geometry, occupying the coordination sites trans to the benzylidene and the N-heterocyclic carbene ligand. The Ru&boxH;C(l) (benzylidene carbon) bond length of 1.873(4)&angst; is slightly longer than those in five-coordinate ruthenium olefin metathesis catalysts, including (Cl)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(PCy<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ru&boxH;CHPh &lsqb;d(Ru&boxH;C<highlight><subscript>&agr;</subscript></highlight>)&equals;1.838(2)&angst;&rsqb; and complex 1 &lsqb;d(Ru&boxH;C<highlight><subscript>&agr;</subscript></highlight>)&equals;1.835(2)&angst;&rsqb;. Th elongated Ru&boxH;C<highlight><subscript>&agr;</subscript></highlight> bond in 31 likely results from the presence of a trans pyridine ligand. The Ru&mdash;C(38) (N-heterocyclic carbene) bond length of 2.033(4)&angst; is approximately 0.05 &angst; shorter than that in complex 1, which is likely due to the relatively small size and moderate trans influence of pyridine relative to PCy<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The 0.15 &angst; difference in the Ru&mdash;C(1) and Ru&mdash;C(38) bond distances highlights the covalent nature of the former and the dative nature of the latter ruthenium-carbene bond. Interestingly, the two Ru-N bond distances differ by more than 0.15 &angst;, indicating that the benzylidene ligand exerts a significantly larger trans influence than the N-heterocyclic carbene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The kinetics of the reaction between complex 1 and pyridine was investigated in order to determine the mechanism of this ligand substitution. The reaction of complex 1 (0.88 M in toluene) with an excess of pyridine-d<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>(0.18-0.69 M) is accompanied by a 150 nm red shift visible MLCT absorbance, and this transformation can be followed by UV-vis spectroscopy. The disappearance of starting material (502 nm) was monitored at 20&deg; C., and in all cases, the data fit first-order kinetics over five half-lives. A plot of k<highlight><subscript>obs </subscript></highlight>versus &lsqb;C5D5N&rsqb; is presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The data show an excellent linear fit (R<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.999) even at high concentrations of pyridine, and the y-intercept of this line (1.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>) is very close to zero. The rate constant for phosphine dissociation (k<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>) in complex 1 has been determined independently by <highlight><superscript>31</superscript></highlight>p magnetization transfer experiments, and at 20&deg; C., k<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>is 4.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>s<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. This value of k<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>places an upper limit on the rate of dissociative ligand exchange in 1, and the observed rate constants for pyridine substitution are clearly 3 orders of magnitude larger than k<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>. Taken together, these results indicate that the substitution of PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>with pyridine proceeds by an associative mechanism with a second-order rate constant of 5.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>M<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>s<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>at 20&deg; C. In marked contrast, displacement of the phosphine ligand of 1 with olefinic substrates (which is the initiation event in olefin metathesis reactions) occurs via a dissociative mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Initial reactivity studies of complex 31 revealed that both pyridine ligands are substitutionally labile. For example, benzylidene 31 reacts instantaneously with 1.1 equiv. of PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to release pyridine and regenerate complex 1. This equilibrium can be driven back toward the pyridine adduct by addition of an excess of C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>D<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>N, but it is readily reestablished by removal of the volatiles under vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The facile reaction of 31with PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>suggested that the pyridines may be displaced by other incoming ligands and it was discovered that reaction of the bis-pyridine complex with a wide variety of phosphines provides a simple and divergent route to new ruthenium benzylidenes of the general formula (ImesH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)(PR<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)(Cl)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ru&boxH;CHPh. The combination of 31 and 1.1 equiv. of PR<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>results in a color change from green to red/brown and formation of the corresponding PR<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>adduct. The residual pyridine can be removed under vacuum, and the ruthenium products are purified by several washes with pentane and/or by column chromatography. This ligand substitution works well for a variety of alkyl- and aryl-substituted phosphines including PPH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, PBn<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and P(n-Bu)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to produce complexes 32, 33 and 34.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> There appear to be both steric and electronic limitations on the incoming phosphine ligand in the pyridine substitution reaction. For example, complex 31 does not react with P(o-tolyl)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to produce a stable product, presumably due to the prohibitive size of the incoming ligand. The cone angle of P(o-tolyl)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is 194&deg;, while that of PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(one of the larger phosphines shown to successfully displace the pyridines of 31) is 170&deg;. Additionally, the electron-poor phosphine P(C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>shows no reaction with 31, even under forcing conditions. This ligand has a significantly lower electron donor capacity (&khgr;&equals;33.6 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>) than P(p-CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(&khgr;&equals;20.5 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>) and also has a larger cone angle than PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(&thgr;&equals;184&deg;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The methodology described herein represents a dramatic improvement over previous synthetic routes to the complexes (NHC)(PR<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)(Cl)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ru&boxH;CHPh. Earlier preparations of these compounds involved reaction of the bis-phosphine precursor (PR<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(Cl)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ru&boxH;CHPh with an NHC ligand. These transformations were often low yielding (particularly when the NHC was small), and required the parallel synthesis of ruthenium precursors containing each PR<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>ligand. Furthermore, bis-phosphine starting materials containing PR<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>ligands that are smaller and less electron-donating than PPh<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(&thgr;&equals;145&deg;; &khgr;&equals;13.25 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>; pK<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>&equals;2.73) cannot be prepared, placing severe limitations on the complexes that are available by the earlier preparation methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The chlorine ligands of 31 are also substantially labile relative to those in the parent complex 1. For example, 31 reacts quantitatively with NaI within 2 hours at room temperature to afford (ImesH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)(I)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>N)Ru&boxH;CHPh (38). In contrast, the reaction between 1 and NaI takes approximately 8 hours to reach completion under identical conditions. Interestingly, <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR spectroscopy reveals that the diiodide complex 38 contains only one pyridine ligand, while the analogous dichloride species 31 coordinates 2 equiv. of pyridine. The relatively large size of the iodide ligands and the lower electrophilicity at the metal center in 38 (as compared to 31) are both believed to contribute to the formation of a five-coordinate complex in this system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Complex 31 also reacts quantitatively with KTp &lsqb;Tp&equals;tris(pyrazolyl)borate&rsqb; within 1 h at 25&deg; C. to produce the bright green product Tp(hmesH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)(Cl)Ru&boxH;CHPh (39), while the analogous reaction between complex 1 and KTp is extremely slow. (The latter proceeds to less than 50% completion even after several days at room temperature). Removal of the solvents under vacuum followed by filtration and several washes with pentane and methanol provides 39 as an air and moisture stable solid. Preliminary <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR studies also show that the combination of 31 with an excess of KO<highlight><superscript>t</superscript></highlight>-Bu produces the four-coordinate benzylidene, (ImesH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)&mdash;(O<highlight><superscript>t</superscript></highlight>Bu)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ru&boxH;CHPh (40), quantitatively within 10 min. at ambient temperature. In contrast, the reaction between 1 and KO<highlight><superscript>t</superscript></highlight>-Bu to form 40 does not proceed to completion, even after several days at 35 C. Complex 40 may be considered a model for the 14-electron intermediate, (IMesH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)(Cl)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ru&boxH;CHPh, involved in olefin metathesis reactions of 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a high-yielding procedure for the preparation of (IMesH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)(Cl) 2 (C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>N)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ru&boxH;CHPh (31) from (IMesH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)(Cl)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(PCy<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)Ru&boxH;CHPh (1). In contrast to the reaction of 1 with olefinic substrates, this ligand substitution proceeds by an associative mechanism. Complex 31 reacts readily with phosphines, providing access to new complexes discussed herein. Complex 31 also undergoes reaction with KO<highlight><superscript>t</superscript></highlight>-Bu, NaI, and KTp to provide new four-, five-, and six-coordinate ruthenium benzylidenes. The inventive methodology is useful for facilitating the development of new ruthenium olefin metathesis catalysts containing structurally diverse ligand arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Olefin Metathesis: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The inventive complexes are useful in olefin metathesis reactions, particularly for polymerization reactions. These catalysts can be used in various metathesis reactions, including but not limited to, ring-opening metathesis polymerization of strained and unstrained cyclic olefins, ring-closing metathesis of acyclic dienes, acyclic diene metathesis polymerization (&ldquo;ADMET&rdquo;), self- and cross-metathesis reactions, alkyne polymerization, carbonyl olefination, depolymerization of unsaturated polymers, synthesis of telechelic polymers, and olefin synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The most preferred olefin monomer for use in the invention is substituted or unsubstituted dicyclopentadiene (DCPD). Various DCPD suppliers and purities may be used such as Lyondell 108 (94.6% purity), Veliscol UHP (99&plus;% purity), B.F. Goodrich Ultrene&reg; (97% and 99% purities), and Hitachi (99&plus;% purity). Other preferred olefin monomers include other cyclopentadiene oligomers including trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and the like; cyclooctadiene (COD; DuPont); cyclooctene (COE, Alfa Aesar); cyclohexenylnorbornene (Shell); norbornene (Aldrich); norbornene dicarboxylic anhydride (nadic anhydride); norbornadiene (Elf Atochem); and substituted norbornenes including butyl norbornene, hexyl norbornene, octyl norbornene, decyl norbornene, and the like. Preferably, the olefinic moieties include mono-or disubstituted olefins and cycloolefins containing between 3 and 200 carbons. Most preferably, metathesis-active olefinic moieties include substituted or unsubstituted cyclic or multicyclic olefins, for example, cyclopropenes, cyclobutenes, cycloheptenes, cyclooctenes, &lsqb;2.2.1&rsqb;bicycloheptenes, &lsqb;2.2.2&rsqb;bicyclooctenes, benzocyclobutenes, cyclopentenes, cyclopentadiene oligomers including trimers, tetramers, pentamers, and the like; cyclohexenes. It is also understood that such compositions include frameworks in which one or more of the carbon atoms carry substituents derived from radical fragments including halogens, pseudohalogens, alkyl, aryl, acyl, carboxyl, alkoxy, alkyl- and arylthiolate, amino, aminoalkyl, and the like, or in which one or more carbon atoms have been replaced by, for example, silicon, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, antimony, or boron. For example, the olefin may be substituted with one or more groups such as thiol, thioether, ketone, aldehyde, ester, ether, amine, amide, nitro, carboxylic acid, disulfide, carbonate, isocyanate, phosphate, phosphite, sulfate, sulfite, sulfonyl, carbodiimide, carboalkoxy, carbamate, halogen, or pseudohalogen. Similarly, the olefin may be substituted with one or more groups such as C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkyl, aryl, acyl, C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkoxide, aryloxide, C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkyldiketonate, aryldiketonate, C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>carboxylate, arylsulfonate, C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkylsulfonate, C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkylthio, arylthio, C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkylsulfonyl, and C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkylsulfinyl, C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>alkylphosphate, arylphosphate, wherein the moiety may be substituted or unsubstituted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> These olefin monomers may be used alone or mixed with each other in various combinations to adjust the properties of the olefin monomer composition. For example, mixtures of cyclopentadiene dimer and trimers offer a reduced melting point and yield cured olefin copolymers with increased mechanical strength and stiffness relative to pure poly-DCPD. As another example, incorporation of COD, norbornene, or alkyl norbornene co-monomers tend to yield cured olefin copolymers that are relatively soft and rubbery. The resulting polyolefin compositions formed from the metathesis reactions are amenable to thermosetting and are tolerant of additives, stabilizers, rate modifiers, hardness and/or toughness modifiers, fillers and fibers including, but not limited to, carbon, glass, aramid (e.g., Kevlar&reg; and Twaron&reg;), polyethylene (e.g., Spectra&reg; and Dyneema&reg; ), polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole (e.g., Zylon&reg;), polybenzamidazole (PBI), and hybrids thereof as well as other polymer fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The metathesis reactions may optionally include formulation auxiliaries. Known auxiliaries include antistatics, antioxidants (primary antioxidants, secondary antioxidants, or mixtures thereof), ceramics, light stabilizers, plasticizers, dyes, pigments, fillers, reinforcing fibers, lubricants, adhesion promoters, viscosity-increasing agents, and demolding enhancers. Illustrative examples of fillers for improving the optical physical, mechanical, and electrical properties include glass and quartz in the form of powders, beads, and fibers, metal and semi-metal oxides, carbonates (e.g. MgCO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, CaCO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), dolomite, metal sulfates (e.g. gypsum and barite), natural and synthetic silicates (e.g. zeolites, wollastonite, and feldspars), carbon fibers, and plastics fibers or powders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The UV and oxidative resistance of the polyolefin compositions resulting from the metathesis reactions using the inventive carbene complex may be enhanced by the addition of various stabilizing additives such as primary antioxidants (e.g., sterically hindered phenols and the like), secondary antioxidants (e.g., organophosphites, thioesters, and the like), light stabilizers (e.g., hindered amine light stabilizers or HALS), and UV light absorbers (e.g., hydroxy benzophenone absorbers, hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole absorbers, and the like), as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/498,120, filed Feb. 4, 2000, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Exemplary primary antioxidants include, for example, 4,4&prime;-methylenebis (2,6-di-tertiary-butylphenol) (Ethanox 702&reg;; Albemarle Corporation), 1,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris (3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) benzene (Ethanox 330&reg;; Albermarle Corporation), octadecyl-3-(3&prime;,5&prime;-di-tert-butyl-4&prime;-hydroxyphenyl) propionate (Irganox 1076&reg;; Ciba-Geigy), and pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate)(Irganox&reg; 1010; Ciba-Geigy). Exemplary secondary antioxidants include tris(2,4-ditert-butylphenyl)phosphite (Irgafos&reg; 168; Ciba-Geigy), 1:11(3,6,9-trioxaudecyl)bis(dodecylthio)propionate (Wingstay&reg; SN-1; Goodyear), and the like. Exemplary light stabilizers and absorbers include bis(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidinyl)-&lsqb;&lsqb;3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl&rsqb;methyl&rsqb;butylmalonate (Tinuvin&reg; 144 HALS; Ciba-Geigy), 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4,6-ditertpentylphenol (Tinuvino&reg; 328 absorber; Ciba-Geigy), 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(5-chlorobenzotriazol-2-yl)phenyl (Tinuvin&reg; 327 absorber; Ciba-Geigy), 2-hydroxy-4-(octyloxy)benzophenone (Chimassorb&reg; 81 absorber; Ciba-Geigy), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In addition, a suitable rate modifier such as, for example, triphenylphosphine (TPP), tricyclopentylphosphine, tricyclohexylphosphine, triisopropylphosphine, trialkylphosphites, triarylphosphites, mixed phosphites, or other Lewis base, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,504 and U.S. application Ser. No. 09/130,586, the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference, may be added to the olefin monomer to retard or accelerate the rate of polymerization as required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The resulting polyolefin compositions, and parts or articles of manufacture prepared therefrom, may be processed in a variety of ways including, for example, Reaction Injection Molding (RIM), Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) and vacuum-assisted variants such as VARTM (Vacuum-Assisted RTM) and SCRIMP (Seemann Composite Resin Infusion Molding Process), open casting, rotational molding, centrifugal casting, filament winding, and mechanical machining. These processing compositions are well known in the art. Various molding and processing techniques are described, for example, in PCT Publication WO 97/20865, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The metathesis reactions may occur in the presence or absence of a solvent. Examples of solvents that can be used in the polymerization reaction include organic, protic, or aqueous solvents, which are preferably inert under the polymerization conditions. Examples of such solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, ethers, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, water, or mixtures thereof. Preferred solvents include benzene, toluene, p-xylene, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, pentane, methanol, ethanol, water or mixtures thereof. More preferably, the solvent is benzene, toluene, p-xylene, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, pentane, methanol, ethanol, or mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the solvent is toluene, or a mixture of benzene and methylene chloride. The solubility of the polymer formed in the polymerization reaction will depend on the choice of solvent and the molecular weight of the polymer obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The inventive complexes have a well-defined ligand environment that enables flexibility in modifying and fine-tuning the activity level, stability, solubility and ease of recovery of these catalysts. The solubility of the carbene compounds may be controlled by proper selection of either hydrophobic or hydrophilic ligands as is well known in the art. The desired solubility of the catalyst will largely be determined by the solubility of the reaction substrates and reaction products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The inventive metal carbene complexes have shown a high rate of initiation allowing for most, if not all, of the complex added to the reaction to be consumed. Thus, less catalyst is wasted in the metathesis reaction. In contrast, the previous pentacoordinated initiators had a higher amount of extractibles (i.e. unpolymerized monomer) remaining after the reaction concluded. The rate of propagation is also slowed by the presence of the two pyridine ligands. The high rate of initiation and low rate of propagation yields polymers with narrow polydisperities relative to those achieved with the earlier pentacoordinated complexes. Moreover, it was determined that heat increases the rate of the initiation. Thermal initiation of the pentacoordinated complexes can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,420, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In general, the initiation and/or rate of the metathesis polymerization using the inventive catalysts is controlled by a method comprising contacting the inventive catalyst with an olefin and heating the reaction mixture. In a surprising and unexpected result, the T<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>for the thermal initiation of the inventive catalyst is significantly higher than the T<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>for the previous pentacoordinated catalysts. Without being bound by theory, this is significant in that in a reaction using a metathesis catalyst, if the part or article being prepared is a type of filled system (e.g., a system containing reinforcing fillers, fibers, beads, etc.), the filling material may act as a heat sink. With the previous pentacoordinated catalysts, post-curing was sometimes necessary due to the effect of the heat sink resulting from a filled system. ROMP polymerization in the presence of peroxide cross linking agents using pentacoordinated catalysts is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,785, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In contrast, the reactions using the inventive hexacoordinated catalysts generate significantly more internal heat. This high T<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>reduces the need for post cure. Additionally, even if peroxides or radicals are added to promote crosslinking, the degree of crosslinking in the part that uses the radical mechanism is increased in comparison to a part prepared using the previous pentacoordinated metathesis catalysts. Moreover, the half-life is dependent on the maximum temperature. Using the inventive catalysts, the half life is reduced substantially, and therefore less catalyst is needed, providing a significant commercial advantage. Without being bound by theory, the higher T<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>indicates that in a ROMP reaction, more rings are opened, and there is a better degree of cure. With a higher T<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>, the extractibles are almost to zero, indicating that almost every molecule that can be reacted is reacted. For example, the vinylidenes are advantageous in that they are more stable at higher temperatures than the alkylidenes. When the protected NHC (e.g., a saturated Imes ligand as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/288,680 and 60/278,311, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference), is added to the reaction mixture, a dramatic increase in peak exotherm is seen. Additionally, the time to reach the peak is significantly reduced. A high peak exotherm means more catalyst is available for polymerization, indicating that the extractibles are close to zero. Accordingly, the inventive catalysts have better conversion, better properties, even in the presence of fillers and additives. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Bacteria communicate with each other to coordinate expression of specific genes in a cell density dependent fashion. This &ldquo;bacterial signaling&rdquo; is a phenomenon called quorum sensing and response. Quorum sensing enables a bacterial species to sense its own number and regulate gene expression according to population density. In other words, quorum sensing is cell density-dependent regulation of genes that involves a freely diffusible molecule synthesized by the cell called an autoinducer (Fuqua, W. C. et al (1996) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>50:727-751; Salmond, G. P. C. et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Mol Microbiol. </italic></highlight>16:615-624; Sitnikov, D. M. et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Mol. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>17:801-812). Autoinducers are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,591,872 and 5,593,827. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Autoinducer molecules and methods for the use of autoinducer molecules are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,591,872 and 6,057,288, and in published PCT international patent application Nos. WO 98/57618, WO 98/58075, WO 99/65889, and WO 00/06177. Bacteria at a low cell density produce a basal level of autoinducer, and, as a population grows, autoinducer concentration increases concomitantly with cell density. On reaching a threshold concentration, autoinducer binds to and thereby activates an R protein, which then induces or ceases to repress specific target genes. In this manner, intercellular signals enable a bacterial population to control the expression of specific genes in response to cell density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The paradigm system for quorum sensing is the lux system of the luminescent marine bacterium, <highlight><italic>Vibrio fischeri. V fischeri </italic></highlight>exists at low cell densities in sea water and also at very high cell densities within the light organs of various marine organisms, such as the squid <highlight><italic>Euprymna scolopes </italic></highlight>(Pesci, E. C. et al.(1997) <highlight><italic>Trends in Microbiol. </italic></highlight>5(4):132-135; Pesci, E. C. et al. (1997)<highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>179:3127-3132; Ruby, E. G. (1996) <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>50:591-624). At high cell densities, the <highlight><italic>V. fischeri </italic></highlight>genes encoding the enzymes required for light production are expressed. These genes are part of the lux ICDABEG operon and are regulated by the gene products of luxI and luxR (Baldwin, T. O. et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>J. of Biolum. and Chemilum. </italic></highlight>4:326-341; Eberhard, A., et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Arch. of Microbiol. </italic></highlight>155:294-297; Gray, K. M. et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>174:4384-4390). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> LuxI is an autoinducer synthase that catalyzes the formation of the <highlight><italic>V. fischeri </italic></highlight>autoinducer (VAI), N-(3oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone (Eberhard, A., et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Arch. of Microbiol. </italic></highlight>155:294-297; Seed, P. C. et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>177:654-659). The autoinducer freely diffuses across the cell membrane and at high cell densities, reaches a critical concentration (Kaplan, H. B. et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>163:1210-1214). At this critical concentration, VAI interacts with LuxR, a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator. The LuxR-VAI complex then binds to an upstream sequence of the lux operon called the &ldquo;lux box&rdquo;, and activates transcription (Devine, J. H. et al. (1989) <highlight><italic>PNAS </italic></highlight>86: 5688-5692; Hanzelka, B. A. et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>177:815-817; Stevens, A. M. et al. (1994) <highlight><italic>PNAS </italic></highlight>91:12619-12623). Since one of the genes of the operon is luxI, an autoregulatory loop is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Many gram-negative bacteria have been shown to possess one or more quorum sensing systems (Fuqua, W. C. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>50:727-751; Salmond, G. P. C. et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Mol. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>16:615-624). These systems regulate a variety of physiological processes, including the activation of virulence genes. In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that quorum sensing is involved in biofilm formation (Davies, D. G. et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Science. </italic></highlight>280(5361):295-8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The systems typically have acylated homoserine lactone (&ldquo;HSL&rdquo;) ring autoinducers, in which the homoserine lactone ring is conserved. The acyl side chain, however, can vary in length and degree of substitution. <highlight><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic></highlight>has two quorum sensing systems, las and rhl (Brint et al. 1995, Hanzelka et al. 1996, Baldwin et al., 1989, Passador et al. 1993, Pearson et al. 1997, Pesci et al. 1997). The two systems have distinct autoinducer synthases (lasI and rhlI), transcriptional regulators (lasR and rhlR), and autoinducers (N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (HSL) and N-butyryl HSL) (Sitnikov et al., 1995, Stevens et al. 1994). N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone is synthesized by LasI along with a small amount of N-(3-oxooctanoyl) HSL and N-(3-oxohexanoyl) HSL, while RhlI makes primarily N-butyryl HSL and a small amount of N-hexanoyl (Pearson et al. 1994, Winson et al. 1995). The rhl and las systems are involved in regulating the expression of a number of secreted virulence factors, biofilm development, and the stationary phase sigma factor (RpoS) (Brint et al. 1995, Davies et al. 1998, Latifi et al. 1996, Ochsner et al. 1995, Pesci et al. 1997). Expression of the rhl system requires a functional las system. Therefore the two systems in combination with RpoS constitute a regulatory cascade (Pesci et al. 1997, Seed et al. 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Biofilms are defined as an association of microorganisms, single or multiple species, that grow attached to a surface and produce a slime layer that provides a protective environment (Costerton, J. W. (1995) J Ind Microbiol. 15(3):137-40, Costerton, J. W. et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Annu Rev Microbiol. </italic></highlight>49:711-45). Typically, biofilms produce large amounts of extracellular polysaccharides, responsible for the slimy appearance, and are characterized by an increased resistance to antibiotics (1000- to 1500-fold less susceptible). Several mechanisms are proposed to explain this biofilm resistance to antimicrobial agents (Costerton, J. W. et al. (1999) Science. 284(5418):1318-22). One idea is that the extracellular matrix in which the bacterial cells are embedded provides a barrier toward penetration by the biocides. A further possibility is that a majority of the cells in a biofilm are in a slow-growing, nutrient-starved state, and therefore not as susceptible to the effects of antimicrobial agents. A third mechanism of resistance could be that the cells in a biofilm adopt a distinct and protected biofilm phenotype, e.g., by elevated expression of drug-efflux pumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In most natural settings, bacteria grow predominantly in biofilms. Biofilms of <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>have been isolated from medical implants, such as indwelling urethral, venous or peritoneal catheters (Stickler, D. J. et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Appl Environ Microbiol. </italic></highlight>64(9):3486-90). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Chronic <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>infections in cystic fibrosis lungs are considered to be biofilms (Costerton, J. W. et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>Science. </italic></highlight>284(5418):1318-22). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In industrial settings, the formation of biofilms is often referred to as &lsquo;biofouling&rsquo;, or biological fouling. Biological fouling of surfaces is common and leads to material degradation, product contamination, mechanical blockage, and impedance of heat transfer in water-processing systems. Biofilms are also the primary cause of biological contamination of drinking water distribution systems, due to growth on filtration devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As noted earlier, many gram-negative bacteria have been shown to possess one or more quorum sensing systems that regulate a variety of physiological processes, including the activation of virulence genes and biofilm formation. One such gram negative bacterium is <highlight><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>is a soil and water bacterium that can infect animal hosts. Normally, the host defense system is adequate to prevent infection. However, in immunocompromised individuals (such as burn patients, patients with cystic fibrosis, or patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy), <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>is an opportunistic pathogen, and infection with <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>can be fatal (Govan, J. R. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Microbiol Rev. </italic></highlight>60(3):539-74; Van Delden, C. et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Emerg Infect Dis. </italic></highlight>4(4):551-60). For example, Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common inherited lethal disorder in Caucasian populations (&tilde;1 out of 2,500 life births), is characterized by bacterial colonization and chronic infections of the lungs. The most prominent bacterium in these infections is <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></highlight>&mdash;by their mid-twenties, over 80% of people with CF have <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>in their lungs (Govan, J. R. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Microbiol Rev. </italic></highlight>60(3):539-74). Although these infections can be controlled for many years by antibiotics, ultimately they &ldquo;progress to mucoidy,&rdquo; meaning that the <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>forms a biofilm that is resistant to antibiotic treatment. At this point the prognosis is poor. The median survival age for people with CF is the late 20s, with <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>being the leading cause of death (Govan, J. R. et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Microbiol Rev. </italic></highlight>60(3):539-74). According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, treatment of CF cost more than $900 million in 1995 (Foundation, CF http://www.cff.org/homelinel99701.htm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>is also one of several opportunistic pathogens that infect people with AIDS, and is the main cause of bacteremia (bacterial infection of the blood) and pneumonitis in these patients (Rolston, K. V. et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Cancer Detect Prev. </italic></highlight>14(3):377-81; Witt, D. J. et al. (1987) <highlight><italic>Am J Med. </italic></highlight>82(5):900-6). A recent study of 1635 AIDS patients admitted to a French hospital between 1991-1995 documented 41 cases of severe <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>infection (Meynard, J. L. et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>J Infect. </italic></highlight>38(3):176-81). Seventeen of these had bacteremia, which was lethal in 8 cases. Similar numbers were obtained in a smaller study in a New York hospital, where the mortality rate for AIDS patients admitted with <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>bacteremia was about 50% (Mendelson, M. H. et al. 1994. <highlight><italic>Clin Infect Dis. </italic></highlight>18(6):886-95). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, about two million Americans suffer serious burns each year, and 10,000-12,000 die from their injuries. The leading cause of death is infection (Lee, J. J. et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>J Burn Care Rehabil. </italic></highlight>11(6):575-80). <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>bacteremia occurs in 10% of seriously burned patients, with a mortality rate of 80% (Mayhall, C. G. (1993) p. 614-664, Prevention and control of nosocomial infections. Williams &amp; Wilkins, Baltimore; McManus, A. T et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>Eur J Clin Microbiol. </italic></highlight>4(2):219-23). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Such infections are often acquired in hospitals (&ldquo;nosocomial infections&rdquo;) when susceptible patients come into contact with other patients, hospital staff, or equipment. In 1995 there were approximately 2 million incidents of nosocomial infections in the U.S., resulting in 88,000 deaths and an estimated cost of $4.5 billion (Weinstein, R. A. (1998) <highlight><italic>Emerg Infect Dis. </italic></highlight>4(3):416-20). Of the AIDS patients mentioned above who died of <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>bacteremia, more than half acquired these infections in hospitals (Meynard, J. L. et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>J Infect. </italic></highlight>38(3):176-81). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Nosocomial infections are especially common in patients of intensive care units as these people often have weakened immune systems and are frequently on ventilators and/or catheters. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are the most common nosocomial infection (Richards, M. J. et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>Crit Care Med. </italic></highlight>27(5):887-92) (31% of the total), and <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>is highly associated with biofilm growth and catheter obstruction. While the catheter is in place, these infections are difficult to eliminate (Stickler, D. J. et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Appl Environ Microbiol. </italic></highlight>64(9):3486-90). The second most frequent nosocomial infection is pneumonia, with <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>the cause of infection in 21% of the reported cases (Richards, M. J. et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>Crit Care Med. </italic></highlight>27(5):887-92). The annual costs for diagnosing and treating nosocomial pneumonia has been estimated at greater than $2 billion (Craven, D. E. et al. (1991)<highlight><italic>Am J Med. </italic></highlight>91(3B):44S-53S). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Treatment of these so-called nosocomial infections is complicated by the fact that bacteria encountered in hospital settings are often resistant to many antibiotics. In June 1998, the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System reported increases in resistance of <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>isolates from intensive care units of 89% for quinolone resistance and 32% for imipenem resistance compared to the years 1993-1997 (NNIS. http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/NNIS/AR_Survl 198.htm). In fact, some strains of <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>are resistant to over 100 antibiotics (Levy, S. (1998) <highlight><italic>Scientific American. </italic></highlight>March). There is a critical need to overcome the emergence of bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibiotics (Travis, J. (1994) <highlight><italic>Science. </italic></highlight>264:360-362). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>is also of great industrial concern (Bitton, G. (1994) Wastewater Microbiology. Wiley-Liss, New York, N.Y.; Steelhammer, J. C. et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Indust. Water Treatm.:</italic></highlight>49-55). The organism grows in an aggregated state, i.e., the biofilm, which causes problems in many water processing plants. Of particular public health concern are food processing and water purification plants. Problems include corroded pipes, loss of efficiency in heat exchangers and cooling towers, plugged water injection jets leading to increased hydraulic pressure, and biological contamination of drinking water distribution systems (Bitton, G. (1994) Wastewater Microbiology. Wiley-Liss, New York, N.Y., 9). The elimination of biofilms in industrial equipment has so far been the province of biocides. Biocides, in contrast to antibiotics, are antimicrobials that do not possess high specificity for bacteria, so they are often toxic to humans as well. Biocide sales in the US run at about $1 billion per year (Peaff, G. (1994) <highlight><italic>Chem. Eng. News: </italic></highlight>15-23). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A particularly ironic connection between industrial water contamination and public health issues is an outbreak of <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>peritonitis that was traced back to contaminated poloxamer-iodine solution, a disinfectant used to treat the peritoneal catheters. <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>is commonly found to contaminate distribution pipes and water filters used in plants that manufacture iodine solutions. Once the organism has matured into a biofilm, it becomes protected against the biocidal activity of the iodophor solution. Hence, a common soil organism that is harmless to the healthy population, but causes mechanical problems in industrial settings, ultimately contaminated antibacterial solutions that were used to treat the very people most susceptible to infection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Regulation of virulence genes by quorum sensing is well documented in <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa. </italic></highlight>Recently, genes not directly involved in virulence including the stationary phase sigma factor rpoS and genes coding for components of the general secretory pathway (xcp) (Jamin, M. et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Biochem J. </italic></highlight>280(Pt 2):499-506) have been reported to be positively regulated by quorum sensing. Furthermore, the las quorum sensing system is required for maturation of <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>biofilms (Chapon-Herve, V. et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Mol. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>24, 1169-1170; Davies, D. G., et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>280, 295-298). Thus it seems clear that quorum sensing represents a global gene regulation system in <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa. </italic></highlight>However, the number and types of genes controlled by quorum sensing have not been identified or studied extensively. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a novel autoinducer molecule, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone, which functions as an intercellular signal molecule in the cell-to-cell communication system of <highlight><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </italic></highlight>The demonstration that 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone can function as an intercellular signal sheds light on the role of secondary metabolites and shows that <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>cell-to-cell signaling is not restricted to acyl-homoserine lactones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The synthesis and bioactivity of Pseudomonas quinolone signal are mediated by the <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>las and rhl quorum sensing systems, respectively. Accordingly, the invention is directed to bacterial quinolone signal molecules and more particularly to Pseudomonas quinolone signal (&ldquo;PQS&rdquo;) molecules, e.g., 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone, and analogs and derivatives thereof. </paragraph>

Aryl groups also include polycyclic fused aromatic groups such as naphthyl, quinolyl, indolyl, and the like. Those aryl groups having heteroatoms in the ring structure may also be referred to as &ldquo;aryl heterocycles&rdquo;, &ldquo;heteroaryls&rdquo; or &ldquo;heteroaromatics&rdquo;. The aromatic ring can be substituted at one or more ring positions with such substituents as described above, as for example, halogen, hydroxyl, alkoxy, alkylcarbonyloxy, arylcarbonyloxy, alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, carboxylate, alkylcarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, phosphate, phosphonato, phosphinato, cyano, amino (including alkyl amino, dialkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, and alkylarylamino), acylamino (including alkylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, carbamoyl and ureido), amidino, imino, sulfhydryl, alkylthio, arylthio, thiocarboxylate, sulfates, sulfonato, sulfamoyl, sulfonamido, nitro, trifluoromethyl, cyano, azido, heterocyclyl, alkylaryl, or an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety.

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;chain&rdquo; includes moieties of atoms covalently bonded to each other linearly. Generally, the atoms in the chain may be substituted with any substituents that allow the compounds to perform their intended function. Examples of atoms which may be included in a chain of atoms include carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and phosphorous. For example, the linear chain may be entirely composed of carbon atoms. The carbon atoms of the chain may be substituted (e.g., with carbonyl groups, halogens, hydroxy, thiol, amino, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl groups etc.), unsubstituted or bound to hydrogen atoms. In addition, the carbon atoms forming the skeleton of the chain may be replaced with one or more other atoms, e.g., sulfur. Furthermore, the chain can be saturated (e.g., contain only single bounds) or may be unsaturated (e.g., contain double or triple bonds between the atoms of the chain or their substituents.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;compound&rdquo; includes molecules of any one of formulae, as described herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, or prodrugs thereof. The term &ldquo;compound&rdquo; includes analogs of autoinducer molecules as well as inhibitors of autoinducer molecules. Thus, the term &ldquo;compound&rdquo; includes antimicrobial agents, which inhibit or modulate the formation of bacterial virulence factors and/or bacterial biofilms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;heteroatom&rdquo; includes atoms of any element other than carbon or hydrogen. Preferred heteroatoms are nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and phosphorus. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The phrases &ldquo;systemic administration,&rdquo; &ldquo;administered systemically,&rdquo; &ldquo;peripheral administration&rdquo; and &ldquo;administered peripherally&rdquo; as used herein mean the administration of a compound, drug or other material other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the patient&apos;s system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;tail group&rdquo; includes groups that allow the compound of the invention to perform its intended function.

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;modulator&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;modulator of an autoinducer molecule&rdquo; is intended to encompass, in its various grammatical forms, induction and/or potentiation, as well as 25 inhibition and/or down regulation of quorum sensing controlled gene expression. As used herein, the term &ldquo;modulator of quorum sensing signaling&rdquo; includes a compound or agent that is capable of modulating or regulating at least one quorum sensing controlled gene or quorum sensing controlled genetic locus, e.g., a quorum sensing controlled genetic locus in <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa. </italic></highlight>A modulator may act to modulate signal generation (e.g., the synthesis of a quorum sensing signal molecule, i.e., autoinducer molecule), signal reception (e.g., the binding of a signal molecule to a receptor or target molecule), or signal transmission (e.g., signal transduction via effector molecules to generate an appropriate biological response). In one embodiment, a method of the present invention encompasses the modulation of the transcription of an indicator gene in response to an autoinducer molecule. In another embodiment, a method of the present invention encompasses the modulation of the transcription of an indicator gene, preferably an quorum sensing controlled indicator gene, by a test compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;quorum sensing signaling&rdquo; or &ldquo;quorum sensing&rdquo; is intended to include the generation of a cellular signal in response to cell density. In one embodiment, quorum sensing signaling mediates the coordinated expression of specific genes. A &ldquo;quorum sensing controlled gene&rdquo; is any gene, the expression of which is regulated in a cell density dependent fashion. In a preferred embodiment, the expression of a quorum sensing controlled gene is modulated by a quorum sensing signal molecule, e.g., an autoinducer molecule (e.g., a quinolone molecule of the invention). The term &ldquo;quorum sensing signal molecule&rdquo; is intended to include a molecule that transduces a quorum sensing signal and mediates the cellular response to cell density. In a preferred embodiment the quorum sensing signal molecule is a freely diffusible autoinducer molecule, e.g., 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone or analog thereof. In one embodiment, a quorum sensing controlled gene encodes a virulence factor (e.g., exotoxin A, elastase, alkaline protease). In another embodiment, a quorum sensing controlled gene encodes a protein or polypeptide that, either directly or indirectly, inhibits and/or antagonizes a bacterial host defense mechanism. In yet another embodiment, a quorum sensing controlled gene encodes a protein or polypeptide that regulates biofilm formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> II. Methods </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Quorum sensing in <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>first was discovered because of the ability of 3-oxo-C12-HSL and LasR to induce the expression of the lasB gene, which encodes for the elastin-hydrolyzing protease, LasB (3, 5, 6, 9). Subsequently, the expression of lasB also was shown to be controlled by C4-HSL and RhlR, indicating that both known <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>cell-to-cell signals were involved in the regulation of this major virulence factor (4, 10-12). During the analysis of C4-HSL production, it was determined that <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>was capable of producing a third unknown signal that activated lasB. This observation led to the discovery and identification of a novel <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>cell-to-cell signal molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> This novel molecule belongs to the 4-quinolone chemical family, which is best known for the antibiotic activity of many of its members. The signal has been shown to be 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone and it has been designated as the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), shown in FIG. 1C in comparison to known autoinducers 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL. It has also been shown that this compound induces lasB in <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>and depends on the <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>quorum sensing systems for its production and bioactivity.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Discovery of a Novel Cell-to-Cell Signal </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The LasB elastase (also known as elastolytic protease and elastin-hydrolyzing protease) is a significant <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>virulence factor that is controlled by both the las and rhl quorum sensing systems (6, 8). It has been shown that the transcription of lasB is greatly reduced in either a <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>lasI or rhlI mutant, indicating the importance of 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL, respectively (11, 12). Consistent with this finding, strain PAO-R1 (pTS400), which contains a LasR null mutation and a lasB&prime;-lacZ fusion, does not express elastase or &bgr;-gal (6, 7). This phenotype results from the absence of LasR, which positively regulates genes controlled by the las quorum sensing system including rhlR, which is required for the rhl quorum sensing system to function (8, 20, 21). As expected, the absence of lasR also renders the lasB&prime;-lacZ fusion in strain PAO&mdash;R1 (lasR 2) (pTS400) unresponsive to 3-oxo-C12-HSL (4). Additionally, lasB&prime;-lacZ in this strain is mildly activated by exogenously added C4-HSL, which is most likely attributable to the presence of low amounts of RhlR that can be produced in the absence of LasR (4, 20). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it was surprising to find that the addition of a spent culture media extract from <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>strain PAO1 (wild type) to strain PAO-R1 (lasR 2) (pTS400) caused a major induction of lasB&prime;-lacZ (FIG. 2A, below). Furthermore, this induction could not be mimicked with the addition of synthetic 3-oxo-C12-HSL and/or C4-HSL, indicating that an unknown third signal was present in the media from the wild-type strain PAO1. HPLC separation of a strain PAO 1 spent media extract resulted in two fractions that activated the lasB promoter in strain PAO-R1 (lasR 2) (pTS400). One fraction co-eluted with C4-HSL, and the other eluted near 3-oxo-C12-HSL. It was presumed that the material that eluted near 3-oxo-C12-HSL was a novel cell-to-cell signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The lack of lasB&prime;-lacZ induction in strain PAO&mdash;R1 (lasR<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) (pTS400) without the addition of extract (5) showed that production of the novel signal required LasR and presumably 3-oxo-C 12-HSL. Thus, HPLC purification of the novel signal from wild-type strain PAO1 was hampered by the fact that it was not readily separated from 3-oxo-C12-HSL, which is required for LasR activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> This technical difficulty was overcome by construction of a gene that encoded an autoinducer-independent form of LasR. This truncated LasR, referred to as &Dgr;LasR, has a large N-terminal deletion and is encoded on plasmid pECP39. The &Dgr;LasR protein, which was based on a similar truncated construct of the <highlight><italic>Vibrio fischeri </italic></highlight>LuxR protein (a LasR homolog) (22), can activate LasR-controlled genes in the absence of 3-oxo-C12-HSL. Therefore, &Dgr;LasR was used to induce the production of the novel signal in strain PAO-JP2 (lasI<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, rhlI<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>). The double autoinducer mutant, strain PAO-JP2, was transformed with plasmid pECP39, and it was found that a spent culture media extract from this strain contained the novel signal that activated lasB&prime;-lacZ in strain PAO-R1 (lasR<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) (pTS400) (FIG. 2A, below). There were no lasB&prime;-lacZ activating signals in spent media extracts from cultures of strain PAO-JP2 (lasI<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, rhlI<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) alone or containing the control vector pUCP22 (FIG. 2A, below). This confirmed that the synthesis of the new signal depended on LasR and indicated that the signal was not produced by a known autoinducer synthase because strain PAO-JP2 did not have a functional LasI or RhlI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> An initial analysis of the novel signal activity showed that, when the lasR, rhlR double mutant, strain PAO-JP3, containing pTS400 replaced strain PAO-R1(lasR<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) (pTS400) in our bioassay, the signal in culture extracts of strains PAO 1 and PAO-JP2 (lasI<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, rhlI<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) (pECP39) was no longer able to induce lasB&prime;-lacZ (FIG. 2B). This suggested that rhlR was required for the bioactivity of the new signal.

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Using this information, an experiment was conducted to define the requirements for signal activity by developing an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>bioassay for the signal. <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain DH5a was transformed with plasmid pECP62.5, which contained the lasB&prime;-lacZ reporter and the inducible tacp-rhlR gene. If the signal worked directly through RhlR, then the induction of tacp-rhlR in the presence of exogenously added signal should result in the activation of lasB&prime;-lacZ in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain DH5a (pECP62.5). It was determined that the signal did not induce lasB&prime;-lacZ when RhlR was expressed in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain DH5a (pECP62.5). This suggested that the signal&apos;s requirement for rhlR may be attributable to an additional <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>component that is controlled by rhlR or, alternatively, that <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>may be less permeable to this signal. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> This indicated that if multiple signals capable of activating lasB&prime;-lacZ were produced, they would be similar with regard to their hydrophobicity. The eluted signal was further purified by preparative TLC and was chemically analyzed to determine its structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Chemical analysis of the purified signal indicated that, unlike most other Gram-negative autoinducers, it was not an acylated homoserine lactone. Low-resolution mass spectroscopy analysis showed a molecular ion of m/z 259 and a fragmentation pattern consistent with an alkylquinolone that had an additional oxygenation on the heteroaromatic core (FIG. 4A, below). The ultraviolet spectrum and downfield signals of the <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR (FIG. 5A, below) were similar to those of the known 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-quinolone (23, 24). However, the molecular ion and upfield signals of the <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>HNMR (FIG. 5A, below) suggested the presence of a heptyl rather than a methyl chain in position 2. High-resolution mass spectroscopy gave a molecular ion with an m/z of 259.1571, consistent with the chemical composition C16H21NO2 (calculated 5259.1572). Taken together, this data indicated that the novel signal was 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (FIG. 1C, above), which was designated as the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS).

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> To confirm the identification of PQS, synthetic 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone was prepared by sequential Duff reaction (25) and Dakin oxidation (26) of 2-heptylquinolone (27). The low-resolution mass spectrum (FIG. 4B), high-resolution mass spectrum (m/z of 259.1578), and <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR spectrum (FIG. 5B) of synthetic 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone were indistinguishable from those of purified natural PQS. Synthetic and natural PQS were also identical with regard to ultraviolet spectroscopy and TLC analysis. Furthermore, the synthetic material was active in the PQS bioassay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In the presence of increasing concentrations of synthetic or natural PQS, there was a dose-dependent induction of lasB&prime;-lacZ in strain PAO-R1 (lasR<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) (pTS400) (FIG. 6, below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The purification of PQS from a 1.2-liter culture of strain PAO-JP2 (lasI<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, rhlI<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) (pECP39) yielded an average of 1.8 mg of PQS, which is equivalent to a concentration of &cong;6 mM in the culture fluid. This concentration, which is likely to be an underestimate of the actual amount in culture fluid (assuming the total recovery in the purification was 100%), was within the range required for activation of the lasB promoter in <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>strain PAO&mdash;R1 (lasR<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) (pTS400) (FIG. 6; 5 mM synthetic PQS 5 148 Miller units).

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> It is also interesting to note here that two PQS analogs were not capable of activating lasB&prime;-lacZ in strain PAO&mdash;R1 (lasR<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) (pTS400). Despite their structural similarities to PQS, the compounds 2-hydroxy-3- heptyl-4-quinolone (FIG. 1D, above) and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxy-quinoline-N-oxide (FIG. 1E, above) were not active when tested in the PQS bioassay described above (FIG. 6, above). These results suggested that the PQS target may be specific with regard to the compounds by which it is activated, although these two analogs were not tested in a competitive assay to determine that the analogs did not bind to the PQS target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Discussion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The present invention demonstrates that <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>produces a cell-to-cell signal that is unlike any previously reported intercellular signal molecule. This molecule was determined to have a 4-quinolone base structure and therefore has been designated as the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). Furthermore, exogenously added PQS induced a lasB&prime;-lacZ fusion in the <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>lasR mutant, strain PAO&mdash;R1, containing the plasmid pTS400. This indicated that there is a third cell-to-cell signal, in addition to the autoinducers 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL, that is involved in lasB induction by <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa. </italic></highlight>Despite the ability of PQS to activate lasB&prime;-lacZ in the absence of lasR, the production of PQS required an active LasR protein. This suggested that a gene (or genes) required for PQS synthesis is controlled through the las quorum sensing system. It was also determined that at least RhlR was required for PQS to act as a signal because lasB&prime;-lacZ was not induced by PQS in the lasR, rhlR double mutant, strain PAO-JP3, containing the plasmid pTS400. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Although the basis of the requirement for rhlR is not known, it is suggested that RhlR may serve to regulate the expression of a <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>gene that is involved in the response to PQS. This suggestion is based on the fact that the PQS response was not replicated by the addition of PQS to a recombinant <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain expressing RhlR in the presence of lasB&prime;-lacZ. These initial experiments on PQS indicated that this signal depended on both <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>quorum sensing systems and that it was involved in the regulation of the major virulence factor, LasB elastase. The addition of a third molecule to the <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>intercellular signal repertoire increases the complexity of the quorum sensing hierarchy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> With regard to the relationship of these cell-to-cell signals, the data presented herein implies that 3-oxo-C12-HSL is required for the production of PQS, and previous results suggested that 3-oxo-C12-HSL also positively regulates the production of C4-HSL (20, 21). These findings further suggest that 3-oxo-C12-HSL can be considered the dominant <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>cell-to-cell signal that is responsible, with LasR, for initiating the start of the quorum sensing response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The relationship between PQS and C4-HSL is difficult to determine from the data. To act as signals, both molecules require RhlR. The C4-HSL signal has been shown to interact with RhlR (12), but it is not clear whether PQS acts directly or indirectly through RhlR. In either case, it is possible that PQS and C4-HSL produce an additive effect on the induction of lasB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> To facilitate the purification of PQS, a mutated lasR gene was constructed that encoded a truncated protein (&Dgr;LasR) capable of activating LasR-controlled genes in the absence of 3-oxo-C12-HSL. PQS was purified by sequential reverse phase column chromatography and TLC from the double autoinducer mutant, strain PAO-JP2, that was expressing the &Dgr;LasR protein. Based primarily on the spectral properties of the purified material, it was concluded that the novel signal molecule was 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone. This compound was synthesized, and all chemical analysis (including high and low resolution MS, <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR spectra, UV spectra, and TLC) showed that synthetic 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4- quinolone was identical to natural PQS. As a confirmation of the structural assignment, we showed that synthetic PQS, but not other similar quinolones, had biological activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Based on the activity profile of synthetic PQS and the amount of signal purified from <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>culture fluid, it can be conservatively estimated that the concentration of PQS in culture fluid was &cong;-6 mM, which is in the active concentration range. This concentration is similar to the approximate concentrations of 3-oxo-C12-HSL (1 to 5 mM; refs. 3 and 4) and C4-HSL (10 mM; ref. 4) found in culture supernatants. The amount of PQS required to activate the bioassay to half of its maximum activity was &cong;30 mM. Similar <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>bioassays for 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL showed that a concentration of &cong;1 mM was required for these signals to activate their respective assays to half of their maximum activity (4). These differences suggest that, with regard to lasB&prime;-lacZ induction, the relative potency of PQS may not be as high as the potencies of 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> It has been well established that 4-quinolones are secondary metabolites that can have potent antibiotic activity (28). It is now evident that at least one member of this family of molecules, 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone, has a role in cell-to-cell signaling. The modern 4-quinolone antibiotics are halogenated at the 6 or 8 position and are commonly used to treat a variety of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative infections (29). These molecules are bactericidal and are believed to target DNA gyrase, which can be naturally mutated in <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>to produce resistant strains (30, 31). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Despite the development of this resistance phenotype, some 4-quinolone antibiotics have a secondary effect in resistant strains. The synthesis of a number of virulence factors, many of which (including elastase) are controlled by quorum sensing, is reduced by 4-quinolone antibiotics (32). This finding is supported by in vivo studies in which 4-quinolone antibiotic therapy has been shown to reduce lung damage in rats without decreasing the bacterial population (33). The mechanisms of such activities are unknown. However, the data presented herein indicate that 4-quinolone antibiotics may interfere with 4-quinolone signaling and gene activation, and further indicate that 4-quinolone signal molecules may be a viable target for the development of antibacterial therapies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> It is also interesting to note that many synthetic 4-quinolones are exported by active efflux (reviewed in ref. 34) and recent reports show that active efflux is involved in the export of the <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>autoinducer 3-oxo-C12-HSL (35, 36). This leads to the speculation that PQS may be exported by active efflux and that this transport mechanism could be involved in multiple cell-to-cell signaling pathways. <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>produces a myriad of secondary metabolites, most of which (including 4-quinolones) were discovered because they possess an observable bioactivity such as antibacterial or phytotoxic activity (28). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> PQS does not have detectable anti-<highlight><italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic></highlight>or anti-<highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>activity. However, this molecule showed activity as an intercellular signal that induced the P. aeruginosa virulence gene lasB. These findings lead to the conclusion that although acyl-homoserine lactones represent one type of cell-to-cell signal in <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa, </italic></highlight>there are also other types of intercellular signals involved in the regulation of virulence gene expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it has previously been shown that other Gram-negative bacteria produce quorum sensing signals that are not acyl-homoserine lactones. For example, <highlight><italic>Ralstonia solanacearum </italic></highlight>has been shown to produce a fatty acid methyl ester that acts as a signal (37), and both <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salmonella typhimurium </italic></highlight>produce an unidentified intercellular signal that appears to not be an acyl-homoserine lactone (38). The discovery that 4-quinolones can act as intercellular signals demonstrates that bacterial cell-to-cell signals are an increasingly diverse group of molecules. The elucidation of the mechanism by which PQS regulates lasB should be an important first step toward understanding the role of this type of signaling in <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>virulence. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The invention is further illustrated by the following examples that should not be construed as limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Strains, Plasmids, and Reagents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The following bacterial strains were used in this study: <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>strain DH5a (13); the wild-type <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>strain PAO1 (14); and the PAO1 mutant strains PAO-JP2 (lasI, rhlI) (12), PAO-JP3 (lasR, rhlR) (12), and PAO-R1 (lasR) (6). Unless otherwise indicated, bacterial cultures were grown in peptone trypticase soy broth (15) supplemented with 200 mg/ml carbenicillin where appropriate. Plasmid pECP39, which encodes a truncated form of LasR (&Dgr;LasR) that is capable of activating LasR-controlled genes in the absence of an autoinducer, was constructed as follows. First, the intermediate plasmid pKDT39 was constructed by ligating the lasR DNA that encodes LasR amino acids 160-239 in-frame to the histidine fusion site of the expression vector pTRCHisC (Invitrogen). This resulted in the trcp-&Dgr;lasR fusion, which encodes for a truncated, autoinducer-independent form of LasR, the expression of which is controlled by the trc promoter. The trcp-&Dgr;lasR-containing DNA fragment from pKDT39 then was ligated into the <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>cloning vector pUCP22 (16) to form pECP39 (bla, lac<highlight><superscript>q</superscript></highlight>, trcp-&Dgr;lasR, oriP, oriC). Plasmid pTS400 (5) contains a lasB&prime;-lacZ translational fusion, and plasmid pECP62.5 (12) contains tacp-rhlR and a lasB&prime;-lacZ translational fusion. Trans-formations and other molecular techniques were completed with standard procedures (17). The PQS analog 2-hydroxy-3- heptyl-4-quinolone (FIG. 1D) was synthesized as described (18), and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxy-quinoline-N-oxide (FIG. 1E) was purchased from Sigma.</paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Method, system and computer-executable code are disclosed for synthesizing a representation of a circuit into a new circuit representation having greater unateness. The invention includes partitioning a circuit representation to obtain a representation of at least one sub-circuit, recursively decomposing the representation of the at least one sub-circuit into a sum-of-products or product-of-sums representation having greater unateness than the representation of the at least one sub-circuit, merging the sum-of-products or product-of-sums representation into the circuit representation to form a new circuit representation, and repeating until a desired level of unateness for the new circuit representation is achieved. Algebraic division is implemented to merge common expressions of the sum-of-products or product-of-sums representations. A zero-suppressed binary decision diagram is implemented to recursively decompose the representation of the sub-circuit. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method and system for synthesizing a circuit representation of a circuit into a new circuit representation having greater unateness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The number of transistors that can be fabricated in a single IC has been growing exponentially over the last three decades. A well-known example is the Intel series of microprocessors. Intel&apos;s first commercial microprocessor, the 4004, was built with 2,300 transistors in 1971, whereas a recent Intel microprocessor, the Pentium III, introduced in 1999 contains 9.5 million transistors. The clock frequency of the microprocessors also has dramatically increased from the 4004&apos;s 0.1 MHZ to the Pentium III&apos;s 550MHz. The 1998 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors developed by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) predicts that the transistor count and the clock frequency of ICs will grow even faster in the next decade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is thus becoming extremely difficult and time-consuming to design all the components in a complex IC from scratch, verify their functional and timing correctness, and ensure that overall performance requirements are met. To solve this challenging problem, a &ldquo;design reuse&rdquo; methodology is being widely introduced, which integrates large standardized circuit blocks into a single IC called a system on a chip (SOC). An SOC integrates a set of predesigned &ldquo;off-the-shelf&rdquo; blocks to build the entire system on a single chip, just as off-the-shelf IC&apos;s have been used to build a system on a board. The SOC methodology allows IC designers to focus on the interfaces linking the predesigned blocks. Thus it saves a tremendous amount of time that the designers would have spent creating all the blocks from scratch, and verifying their correctness. For this reason, the SOC design approach is becoming increasingly popular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A large portion of the reused blocks in an SOC are intellectual property (IP) circuits, which are also called cores or virtual components, and are often provided by third party vendors. The IP providers typically transfer their designs to SOC designers in a way that hides the key design details of the IP circuits and so protect the IP provider&apos;s investment in the IP designs. The IP circuits that have been developed so far cover numerous functions and support many different IC technologies. Additionally, the number and scope of the available IP circuits are rapidly growing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> IP circuits are currently available in three different forms known as hard, soft, and firm. Hard IP circuits are provided in the form of complete layouts that are optimized and verified by the IP providers for a particular IC technology. Therefore, hard IP circuits can save time in all SOC design steps, but cannot be reoptimized by system designers for other technologies. The intellectual property of hard IP circuits includes all the implementation details and is protected by providing the system designers only with the circuit&apos;s high-level behavioral or functional specifications. Soft IP circuits are provided in the form of register-transfer level (RTL) descriptions, which define the circuit&apos;s behavior using a set of high-level blocks. These blocks can be converted by system designers to lower-level designs at the gate and physical levels. Thus soft IP circuits can be optimized for a variety of IC technologies and performance requirements, while they can save SOC design time in the high-level design and verification steps. Their RTL designs are considered to be the intellectual property contents of soft IP circuits. Finally, firm IP circuits are provided as netlists or gate-level descriptions. They allow the system designers to optimize the IP circuit&apos;s physical design such as cell placement and routing for various IC technologies. They provide the major advantages of both hard and soft IP circuits&mdash;they save system design time while allowing the flexibility of retargeting the IP circuits at various IC technologies. Both their RTL and gate-level designs are considered to be the intellectual property contents of firm IP circuits. While hard IP circuits are primarily aimed at ASIC designs, some soft and firm IP circuits are aimed at SOCs implemented using field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Although the advancement of IC technology allows extremely large designs to be integrated in a single chip, today&apos;s IC technology presents major challenges to the existing design and testing methodologies. For example, testing requirements for complex digital circuits are becoming increasingly tighter. Using traditional processes to synthesize the implementation of digital and other circuits often leads to circuits that are either inefficient in meeting testing requirements (i.e., unreasonably large test sets, etc.) or cannot satisfy design constraints (i.e., delay, area limits, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The unateness of a circuit has a substantial impact on circuit testability and performance. Unate variables of a circuit representation z are variables that appear only in complemented or uncomplemented form in z&apos;s minimal two-level expressions such as sum of products (SOP) or product of sums (POS) expressions; binate variables are non-unate. For example, z<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;a{overscore (b)}&plus;a{overscore (c)}&plus;bcd is a minimal SOP expression for the four-variable function z<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, in which a and d are unate, and b and c are binate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The majority of circuit representations are, in nature, binate, and it is often difficult to synthesize these binate functions into a circuit implementation that can be efficiently tested for manufacturing defects and operate at very high speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For example, a high-speed circuit implementation known as &ldquo;domino logic&rdquo; requires that the circuit to be implemented be unate. Therefore, binate circuit functionality to be implemented in domino logic must be decomposed into unate circuit implementations. Similarly, static CMOS logic implementations become efficient if unate circuit implementations are extracted from an original binate circuit prior to implementation. Datapath logic circuits such as adders, subtractors, comparators, and ALUs are good examples of applications where carry generation functions (i.e., unate functions) are extracted from a larger (often binate) function and implemented in high-speed circuit structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of unate circuit implementations is their relatively small universal test set (i.e., the set of minimal true and maximal false test vectors for a function z). These test vectors have the useful property that they can detect all multiple stuck-at faults in any implementation of z. Universal test sets guarantee a very high coverage of manufacturing defects in a vast range of implementations for given circuit functionality. The universal test sets for binate circuit implementations tend to become excessively large. In addition, the unateness property enables the generation of test vectors from the behavioral functions of circuits before their implementations are actually executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Existing functional decomposition processes are not suited to the goal of decomposing a binate circuit representation into a small set of unate subfunctions. One existing functional decomposition process called kernel extraction is aimed at multi-level logic synthesis. The kernels of a circuit representations are defined as f&apos;s cube-free primary divisors or quotients. For example, the kernels of f&equals;(a&plus;b&plus;c)(d&plus;e)f&plus;bfg&plus;h include d&plus;e, d&plus;e&plus;g, and a&plus;b&plus;c. This decomposition process employs algebraic division operations with the kernels serving as divisors or quotients to f. Here algebraic division represents f by a logic expression of the form f&equals;p&middot;q&plus;r. The kernels of f can be binate, so f&apos;s subfunctions p, q, and r can also be binate. In addition, kernel extraction often leads to an excessive number of subfunctions, and so is not practical for unate decomposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another existing decomposition process is Boole-Shannon expansion, which represents circuit implementation f by xf<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>&plus;{overscore (x)}f<highlight><subscript>{overscore (x)}</subscript></highlight> where f<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is the cofactor of f with respect to x. Cofactor f<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is defined as the subfunction of f obtained by assigning 1 to variable x in f Boole-Shannon expansion has been widely used for binary decision diagram (BDD) construction, technology mapping and field programmable gate array synthesis. Boole-Shannon expansion is unsuited to the goal of obtaining a small set of unate circuit implementations, however, since it may only make the child functions f<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and f<highlight><subscript>{overscore (x)}</subscript></highlight> unate, while always expressing the parent function in a binate form. When applied repeatedly, Boole-Shannon expansion can also produce an unnecessarily large number of subfunctions, as each is created by eliminating only one binate variable at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Finally, a disjoint or disjunctive decomposition represents a boolean function f(X, Y) in the form h(g<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>(X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>), g<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), . . . , g<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>(X<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>), Y), where X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, X<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , X<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>, and Y are disjoint (i.e., non-overlapping) variable sets. This decomposition is relatively easy to compute, and is sometimes used for logic synthesis problems where the interconnection cost dominates the circuit&apos;s overall cost. It has the drawback that many circuit representations cannot be disjointly decomposed, and, like Boole-Shannon expansion, it can make the parent function h binate. Thus, the disjoint decomposition technique is also not appropriate for our unate decomposition goal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> One object of the present invention is to provide a method and system for efficiently synthesizing a circuit representation into a new circuit representation (i.e., circuit implementation) having greater unateness. Notably, those of ordinary skill in the relevant art will appreciate that the present invention may be implemented or applied in a variety of circumstances to synthesize circuits beyond those discussed, by way of example, in the preceding Background Art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> One advantage of circuit implementations that possess unateness is their relatively small universal test set (i.e., the set of its minimal true and maximal false test vectors). Universal test sets guarantee a very high coverage of manufacturing defects in a vast range of implementations for a give function. Unlike universal test sets for highly unate circuit implementations, the universal test sets for largely binate circuits tend to become excessively large. In addition, the unateness property enables the generation of test vectors from the behavioral functions of circuits before their implementations are actually executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of unate circuit implementations is their low chip area. Yet another advantage of unate circuits is their ability to operate at very high speeds. For example, a low-area high-speed circuit implementation known as &ldquo;domino logic&rdquo; requires that the boolean function to be implemented be unate. Therefore, binate functions to be implemented in domino logic must be decomposed into unate functions prior to implementation. Similarly, static CMOS logic implementations become efficient if unate functions are extracted from an original binate function prior to implementation. Datapath logic circuits such as adders, subtractors, comparators, and ALUs are good examples of applications where carry generation functions (i.e., unate functions) are extracted from a larger (often binate) function and implemented in high-speed circuit structures. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>function z is binate for all six variables, so its universal test set consists of all <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> possible test vectors. The decomposed designs of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>require smaller universal test sets (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, respectively), since all their internal blocks are unate. Although the difference in test set size is minor in this small example, it tends to be significant for larger circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Circuits that do not have natural block representations are often implemented by logic synthesis systems, while those with natural block representations are often implemented manually. Although the present invention is not limited to the former case, we assume that the target circuit is of the former type in order to best describe the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> For a given circuit, the block representations created in accordance with the present invention can be considered as design constraints. In other words, the boundaries of the blocks serve as a high-level structural design constraint that must be satisfied by low-level implementations of the circuit such as gate-level or transistor-level implementations. Notably, these design constraints tend to restrict implementation flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The outputs of any blocks in a circuit C&apos;s block representation S<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>define the block functions. Circuit C&apos;s implementation flexibility can be roughly measured by the number of block functions that C employs. This follows from the fact that a large number of block functions in S<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>implies that the functions themselves are small. Block functions in different blocks cannot be merged, so implementations of small block functions are generally less flexible than large ones. Thus the fewer the block functions in S<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, the higher the implementation flexibility of C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For example, Table 1 compares the implementation flexibility of the block representations in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>has three more block functions than <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has 12 more. Whereas <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has full implementation flexibility, the other block representations have limited flexibility. The last column of Table 1 compares the area of some example implementations synthesized by a commercial synthesis system Synopsys&reg; Design Compiler with the goal of reducing area. The area is calculated from the relative gate areas defined in the Synopsys cell library; for example, inverter&equals;1, AND2&equals;2, AND4&equals;3, OR2&equals;2, and OR4&equals;3. In summary, this example suggests that lower implementation flexibility often leads to poor implementations in terms of circuit area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To permit a broad range of implementation styles, the invented synthesis process attempts to decompose a binate function into as small a set of unate subfunctions as possible. In general, a decomposition of function f can be expressed as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>f(X)&equals;h(g<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>(X),g<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(X), . . . , g<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>(X))</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Let f be the root function, subfunction h the parent function, and each subfunction g<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>a child function. X&equals;&lcub;x<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, x<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , x<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&rcub; denotes the support set of f and each g<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. A decomposition is called a unate decomposition if all the subfunctions h and g<highlight><subscript>1.k </subscript></highlight>in f(X) are unate. A decomposition of the form f(X) transforms a single-block model of function f into a two-block model with h defining one block and g<highlight><subscript>1:k </subscript></highlight>the other; see FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a preferred method for synthesizing circuits utilizing unateness properties of boolean functions involves recursive OR and AND decompositions of a circuit output function f and its subfunctions. The OR and AND decompositions represent f(X) by h(g<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>(X), g<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(X)), where h has the form g<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;g<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and g<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>g<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, respectively. We obtain an OR decomposition off from an SOP form of f, and an AND decomposition from a POS form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> For example, consider a binate function f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>whose SOP form is a{overscore (b)}&plus;{overscore (a)}c&plus;{overscore (c)}a. A possible OR decomposition of f<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is h&equals;g<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&plus;g<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>with g<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;{overscore (a)}c and g<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;a{overscore (b)}&plus;{overscore (c)}a. This decomposition makes all the subfunctions h, g<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and g<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>unate, and so is a unate decomposition. Now consider f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&apos;s POS form (a&plus;c)({overscore (a)}&plus;{overscore (b)}&plus;{overscore (c)}). We can obtain directly from this form an AND decomposition with subfunctions h&equals;g<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>g<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, g<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;a&plus;c, and g<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;{overscore (a)}&plus;{overscore (b )}&plus;{overscore (c)}. This is also a unate decomposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> A single OR or AND decomposition of a large binate function may not lead to a unate decomposition. However, a sequence of OR or AND decompositions applied to f recursively always produces a unate decomposition for any function f The general form of such a sequence with k levels is </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In general, we obtain the foregoing kind of unate AND-OR decomposition for f as follows: first decompose f into g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>using an AND or OR operation that makes g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>unate; then repeatedly decompose g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j </superscript></highlight>into g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j&plus;1 </superscript></highlight>and g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j&plus;1 </superscript></highlight>in a similar way, until g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j&plus;1 </superscript></highlight>becomes unate. This must eventually happen, because a g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j </superscript></highlight>of a single product or sum term is unate. In practice, the AND-OR decomposition process often terminates with a final g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j </superscript></highlight>consisting of a relatively large unate function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the global parent function h(g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, . . . , g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>k</superscript></highlight>, g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>k</superscript></highlight>) in (2) is unate.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Notably, an important goal of the block synthesis method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is to find an AND-OR decomposition of a given function f using as few subfunctions as possible. In addition, it is preferred that each g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j </superscript></highlight>be selected in a manner that makes the resulting g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j </superscript></highlight>highly unate.

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> which involves only four subfunctions, one less than the first and second cases, where we selected three AND and three OR operations, respectively. This example shows that how we select the AND-OR operation in each level of the AND-OR decomposition is very important. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Often, there are many possible AND and OR decompositions in each level. This implies the existence of a large number of possible unate AND-OR decompositions. For example, if an SOP form of g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j </superscript></highlight>contains m product terms, we can partition these terms into two groups defining g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j&plus;1 </superscript></highlight>and g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j&plus;1 </superscript></highlight>in 2<highlight><superscript>m </superscript></highlight>different ways. At each level, either an AND or OR operation can be chosen, so the number of possible k-level unate AND-OR decompositions is <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>m&plus;k</superscript></highlight>. Thus, finding a unate AND-OR decomposition of a large function f involving a minimal number of subfunctions is often impractical. We therefore introduce Unate-Decomp, a heuristic process that systematically selects AND or OR decompositions at each recursion level, and produces a final unate AND-OR decomposition containing relatively few subfunctions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Unate-Decomp represents a function f and all its subfunctions in both SOP and POS forms. To produce an AND (OR) decomposition of f, it selects a set S of product terms (sum terms) from the SOP (POS) form of f, so that S constitutes a unate subfunction g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight>. The rest of the product terms (sum terms) of f define subfunction g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>. Unate-Decomp then represents g<highlight><subscript>b </subscript></highlight>by both SOP and POS forms, which it uses to produce an OR and AND decomposition at the next recursion level. To represent SOP and POS forms efficiently, binary decision diagrams can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> To decompose f into as few unate subfunctions as possible, Unate-Decomp produces each g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j </superscript></highlight>in a way that reduces the number of binate variables in g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j</superscript></highlight>. In the case of multiple-function circuits, Unate-Decomp first decomposes each output function f<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>using the method described above. It then merges common subfunctions of different functions f<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>and f<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>to reduce the total number of subfunctions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Notably, representing large circuits directly by two-level expressions is often inefficient. To handle such cases efficiently, a preferred process first partitions a given circuit, and then performs decomposition on each partition. For example, one partition is created for each process of Unate-Decomp parent function h. The resulting decomposition is then merged into the rest of the circuit. Then the next partition is created from the merged circuit, and the next process of Unate-Decomp is conducted. This process is repeated until no more partitioning is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each decomposition step and circuit partition are selected in a way that produces a small number of highly unate subfunctions. Consequently, the resulting block representations tend to have a high level of implementation flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> To decompose f into as few unate subfunctions as possible, Unate-Decomp produces each g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j </superscript></highlight>in a way that reduces the number of binate variables in g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>j</superscript></highlight>. For example, consider the following function f<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Suppose we decompose f<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>into g<highlight><subscript>u&plus;g</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the preceding description, we focused on decomposing a single function.

It then merges common subfunctions of different functions f<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>and f<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>to reduce the total number of subfunctions. Algebraic division operations are often employed by logic synthesis techniques to efficiently combine common expressions. These operations can be easily applied to the results of our AND-OR decompositions, and often reduce the number of subfunctions significantly. Notably, Unate-Decomp incorporates algebraic division in such a manner that two different functions share the divisor of each division. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> UDSYN takes an input circuit in a form such as a Verilog specification whose internal elements can be either functional descriptions or gates. First, UDSYN builds a circuit graph G<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>whose nodes represent the internal elements. It then creates a partition G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>of G<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>using UD-Partition(G<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>), and removes nodes in G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>from G<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>. The output functions of G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>are represented in SOP and POS forms. The process Unate-Decomp(G<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>) performs unate AND-OR decompositions on the output nodes in G<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>, and constructs decomposed blocks B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Blocks B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>created from the i-th partition G<highlight><subscript>Pi </subscript></highlight>are denoted by B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and B<highlight><subscript>i&plus;1</subscript></highlight>, respectively. Step 9 modifies G<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>by inserting all nodes of B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>into G<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>. UDSYN repeats the above steps until all nodes in G<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>are removed. It then constructs a hardware description language (e.g. Verilog, VHDL, etc.) output file by specifying the interconnections among all blocks B<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> We illustrate UDSYN using a gate-level circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> as input. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>show intermediate results of steps 2 to 10 in Table 3. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows the circuit graph G<highlight><subscript>C1 </subscript></highlight>for the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>; each node in G<highlight><subscript>C1 </subscript></highlight>corresponds to a gate in the circuit. UD-Partition(G<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>) creates a partition G<highlight><subscript>P1 </subscript></highlight>starting from the primary inputs of G<highlight><subscript>C1</subscript></highlight>. The shading in G<highlight><subscript>C1 </subscript></highlight>indicates nodes that are selected by UD-Partition(G<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>), and constitute G<highlight><subscript>P1</subscript></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>represents G<highlight><subscript>P1 </subscript></highlight>by a rectangle. All nodes in G<highlight><subscript>P1 </subscript></highlight>are removed from G<highlight><subscript>C1</subscript></highlight>, and are merged into SOP and POS forms by steps 5 to 8. These SOP and POS forms are decomposed by step 8 into unate subfunctions; these subfunctions are grouped into two blocks B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows, B<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>consists of seven subfunctions and B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>consists of three subfunctions. We create a new circuit graph G<highlight><subscript>C2 </subscript></highlight>by merging B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and G<highlight><subscript>C1 </subscript></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>Returning to step 3, UD-Partition(G<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>) selects some nodes (shaded) in G<highlight><subscript>C2 </subscript></highlight>and creates a new partition G<highlight><subscript>P2</subscript></highlight>, which is represented by a rectangle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>Then step 8 decomposes G<highlight><subscript>P2 </subscript></highlight>into blocks B<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and B<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>appearing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight>Step 9 merges B<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>into a new circuit graph G<highlight><subscript>C3 </subscript></highlight>as in the preceding steps; see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g. </italic></highlight><cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>shows a new partition G<highlight><subscript>P3 </subscript></highlight>constructed from G<highlight><subscript>C3</subscript></highlight>. By repeating this process, we finally obtain the decomposed block representation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>consisting of five blocks B<highlight><subscript>1.5</subscript></highlight>. The output functions of these blocks are described by Verilog code in equation form. If UD-Partition(G<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>) constructs k partitions, UDSYN produces a total of k&plus;1 blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Step 6 of Table 3 uses a type of binary decision diagram (BDD) called a zero-suppressed BDD (ZSBDD) to represent the SOP and POS forms of functions. Although other forms of BDD can be used, we limit our attention in this description to ZSBDDs for the sake of presentation. A ZSBDD of a function f is a graph whose paths denote the product terms (cubes) in an SOP form of f. UDSYN uses two ZSBDDs to represent a pair of SOP and POS forms for the internal function of each node in an AND-OR tree like that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Thus an AND-OR tree with n nodes is represented by 2n individual ZSBDDs, each of which is linked to the corresponding node in the tree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>show a ZSBDD representing f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>SOP</superscript></highlight>&equals;ab&plus;{overscore (cb)}. The internal nodes (circles) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>denote the literals appearing in f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>SOP</superscript></highlight>. The terminal or leaf nodes (rectangles) denote the output values that f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>SOP </superscript></highlight>generates when its literals are set to the values specified on the edges. The name &ldquo;zero-suppressed&rdquo; stems from the property that all nodes in a ZSBDD whose 1-edge points to the 1-terminal node are eliminated. Every path from the root to the 1-terminal node represents a cube in f<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>SOP</superscript></highlight>. For example, the path highlighted by the dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>represents cube ab, while the one highlighted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>represents cube {overscore (cb)}. Although ZSBDDs can represent only SOP forms directly, POS forms can also be handled by their complemented form. </paragraph>

In this way, we can represent both SOP and POS forms using ZSBDDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> ZSBDDs have been shown to represent large functions efficiently. This is due to the fact that small ZSBDDs can contain a large number of paths, so a large number of cubes can be often represented by a compact ZSBDD. ZSBDDs also support fast manipulation of sets of cubes such as finding subsets, computing the intersection of cube sets, and performing a type of division operation on cube sets. Utilizing these features, we implement unate AND-OR decomposition and division processes that act directly on ZSBDDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> UD-Partition(G<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>) creates a partition of the input circuit in a way that makes the functions defining the partition highly unate, while meeting a specified partition size limit. Partitions created in this way simplify the unate decomposition process. One pseudo-code embodiment of UD-Partition appears in Table 4. Notably, it is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that a variety of different computer programs and program arrangements can be implemented to support and execute the inventive function of UD-Partition.

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The intuition behind using N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) to guide the partitioning stems from the fact that the more binate the node n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, the more difficult the decomposition process for n<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>tends to be. Steps 1 to 10 traverse every node only once, which has complexity O(N).

Hence the overall complexity of computing N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) for all nodes in G<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>is O(<highlight><superscript>N</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>

The last column gives N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>). For example, for n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;n11, Binate(b, n11)&equals;1, Binate(d, n11)&equals;1, Binate(c, n11)&equals;0, and Binate(e, n11)&equals;0. Thus N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>)&equals;1&plus;1&plus;0&plus;0&equals;2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> After N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) is computed for every n<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>in G<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, UD-Partition selects from G<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>a node n<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>of minimal N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) starting from a primary input of G<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>. It then inserts into G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>all non-partitioned nodes in the transitive fanin region of n<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>. This process is repeated until the size of G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>exceeds a threshold equal to the maximum number of G<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>&apos;s I/O lines. By limiting the partition size in this way, we can prevent ZSBDDs from exploding for large circuits, while producing a partition with highly unate output functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates how we partition G<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Suppose we limit G<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>&apos;s I/O lines to seven inputs and six outputs, that is, we set the threshold to 7/6. The N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) values calculated in Table 5 are shown next to each node n<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>indicate the current G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>created in each iteration by shading, and newly selected nodes by thick circles. The first n<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is selected from the candidate nodes n3, n5, n8, n10, n11, n12, and n13, which are adjacent to the primary inputs. We select n3 whose N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) has the minimum value 0, and add it to G<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>; see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The next search begins from n3 and selects n3&apos;s fanout node n7 whose N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>)&equals;0. We then select all nodes in the transitive fanin region of n7; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>indicates these selected nodes by a dashed line. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows the current G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>consisting of n3, n12, and n7. We then select n14 over n1, n14, and n17, and then select n14&apos;s fanin node n13; the newly selected nodes are again indicated by a dashed line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>We next select n17 over n18, n1, n4, but n17 leads to a partition with seven outputs, one greater than the limit six. Hence we select n18 instead which has the next smallest N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>). We then select nodes in n18&apos;s transitive fanin region; see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>At this point, the number of I/O lines of G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>equals the threshold 7/6, so the partitioning is done. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>indicates the final G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>by shading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Since UD-Partition selects nodes with fewer binate variables first, it often leads to a partition where many output functions are already unate and so require no further decomposition. For example, in G<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>four output functions at n3, n7, n8, and n10 are unate. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows a unate decomposition of this G<highlight><subscript>p, </subscript></highlight>where nodes g3, g7, g8, and g10 in DI correspond to these four unate functions, and so are not decomposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Next we describe Unate-Decomp(G) which systematically applies unate AND-OR decomposition operations to a circuit partition. See Table 6 for one pseudo-code embodiment of Unate-Decomp(G).

<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Graph G initially contains the nodes in the current partition. Steps 3 to 6 perform a level of AND-OR decomposition on every binate node n<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>in G. Then, steps 7 to 13 perform division operations on every binate node in G by treating as divisors child nodes created by the AND-OR decompositions. N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>) denotes the number of binate variables in the subfunction at node n<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>in G. If a division reduces N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>), it is accepted; otherwise, it is discarded. The above process is repeated until all nodes in G become unate. For some large binate functions, forcing all nodes to be unate leads to an excessive number of subfunctions. We therefore stop decomposing a node n<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>if N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(n<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>) becomes less than a certain threshold. This threshold is chosen to yield a small set of subfunctions at the cost of lower unateness. Thus the threshold allows us to trade the level of unateness for a higher implementation flexibility of the block representation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Find-Unate-Cube-Set(ISOP) derives a cube set S from f&apos;s initial SOP form ISOP so that S meets the threshold on N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(S). As a result, S defines unate subfunction g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>k </superscript></highlight>in (1), while ISOP-S defines g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>k</superscript></highlight>. As discussed earlier, an exact method to find an optimum AND-OR decomposition of an m-term ISOP must examine up to 2m possible AND decompositions. To avoid this and derive S efficiently, a type of cofactor operation is implemented which can simultaneously extract from ISOP multiple cubes (product terms) with a common property. This operation, denoted by Subset(SOP, l<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>), removes from SOP all cubes that contain literal l<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. Thus l<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>does not appear in the resulting SOP form S<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, while {overscore (l)}<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>may appear in S<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>; hence S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is unate with respect to l<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> For example, consider a function f<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>whose SOP form is </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Subset(SOP, d) removes cubes a{overscore (d)} and {overscore (bd)}a which contain literal {overscore (d)}, and yield </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The basic concept is to apply Subset(SOP, l<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>) to a set of binate literals in a way that makes both S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and SOP&minus;S<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>highly unate. We found that for a binate l<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, Subset(SOP, l<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>) often eliminates from SOP not only l<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, but also other binate literals. Hence we can often obtain a highly unate cube set S by repeating only a few steps of Subset(SOP, l<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>). The inner loop (steps 3 to 8) of Table 8 performs Subset(SOP, l<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) for all binate literals l<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and selects S<highlight><subscript>best</subscript></highlight>, (i.e., the S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>having the minimum N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>)&plus;N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(ISOP&minus;S<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>)). The outer loop (steps 2 to 9) repeats this process recursively with S<highlight><subscript>best </subscript></highlight>in place of SOP until N<highlight><subscript>BV</subscript></highlight>(S<highlight><subscript>best</subscript></highlight>) becomes less than threshold. The final S<highlight><subscript>best </subscript></highlight>defines g<highlight><subscript>u</subscript></highlight>, while ISOP-S<highlight><subscript>best </subscript></highlight>defines g<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> To illustrate, consider an initial SOP form </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Suppose that the threshold of N<highlight><subscript>BV </subscript></highlight>is 0. Table 9 shows each step of the outer loop in its first iteration with ISOP assigned to SOP.

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The Subset(SOP, l<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) operation conducted using an M-node ZSBDD has a complexity of O(M).

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The prospects for feeding humanity as we enter the new millennium are formidable. The progressive salinization of irrigated land compromises the future of agriculture in the most productive areas of our planet (Serrano, R., et al., <highlight><italic>Crit. Rev. Plant Sci., </italic></highlight>13:121-138 (1994)). Arid regions offer optimal photoperiod and temperature conditions for the growth of most crops, but suboptimal rainfall. Artificial irrigation has solved the problem in the short term. However, water supplies always contain some dissolved salt, which upon evaporation gradually accumulates on the soils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To grow in saline environments, plants must maintain a much lower ratio of Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> in their cytoplasm than that present in the soil. A need exists for crops having increased tolerance to salt. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a transgenic plant which is tolerant to a salt, comprising one or more plant cells transformed with exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant. In one embodiment, the exogenous nucleic acid encodes AVP1 or a homologue thereof. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a transgenic plant which grows in a concentration of a salt that inhibits growth of a corresponding non-transgenic plant. In a particular embodiment, the transgenic plant is tolerant to sodium chloride (NaCl) and the NaCl concentration is from about 0.2M to about 0.3M. In a another embodiment, the present invention relates to a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt comprising (containing within some or all of its cells) an exogenous nucleic acid construct which is designed to overexpress AVP1 or designed to down regulate endogenous pyrophosphatase. In yet another embodiment, the invention relates to a transgenic plant obtained by introducing into a plant exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Also encompassed by the present invention are transgenic progeny and seeds of the transgenic plants described herein. Progeny transgenic plants grown from seed of transgenic plants are also described. </paragraph>

In one embodiment, the AVP1 gene is operably linked to a double tandem enhancer of a 35S promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Plant cells (e.g., root cells, stem cell, leaf cells) comprising exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant cell are also the subject of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also encompassed by the present invention is a method of making a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells in the plant, thereby producing a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt. For example, this can be carried out in a whole plant, seeds, leaves, roots or any other plant part. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of making a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant a nucleic acid construct which is designed to overexpress AVP1 to yield transformed cells thereby producing a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt. The method can further comprise regenerating plants from the transformed cells to yield transgenic plants and selecting a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt, thereby producing a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a method of making a transgenic plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type plant comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells, thereby producing a transgenic plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type. The method can further comprise regenerating plants from the transformed cells to yield transgenic plants and selecting a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt, thereby producing a transgenic plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Transgenic plants produced by the methods of making a transgenic plant as described herein are also a subject of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of bioremediating soil comprising growing one or more transgenic plants and/or progeny thereof in the soil, wherein the transgenic plants and/or progeny thereof comprise exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant. The transgenic plants grow in the soil, and in the process, take up cations from the soil. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of removing one or more cations from a medium which can support plant growth (e.g., soil, water) comprising growing one or more transgenic plants and/or progeny thereof in the medium, wherein the transgenic plants and/or progeny thereof comprise exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for a method of increasing the yield of a plant comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells, thereby increasing the yield of the plant. The method can further comprise regenerating plants from the transformed cells to yield transgenic plants and selecting a transgenic plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type plant, thereby producing a transgenic plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also encompassed by the present invention is a method of making a transgenic plant (e.g., an ornamental plant) having increased flower size compared to its corresponding wild type plant comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells, thereby producing a transgenic plant having increased flower size compared to its corresponding wild type plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides for a method of producing a transgenic plant which grows in salt water, such as water in which the salt concentration is equivalent to that of seawater (e.g., about 0.2M to about 0.4M), comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells, thereby producing a transgenic plant which grows in salt water. The method can further comprise regenerating plants from the transformed cells to yield transgenic plants and selecting a transgenic plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type plant, thereby producing a transgenic plant which can grow in salt water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The transgenic plants of the present invention can also be used to produce double transgenic plants which are tolerant to salt (about 0.2M to about 0.4M salt concentration). In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a double transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt comprising one or more plant cells transformed with exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of a vacuolar pyrophosphatase and an Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>antiporter in the plant.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Producing salt-tolerant plants using genetic engineering requires the identification of the relevant genes. Physiological studies suggest that salt exclusion in the root and/or salt sequestration in the leaf cell vacuoles are critical determinants for salt tolerance (Kirsch, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol., </italic></highlight>32:543-547 (1996)). Toxic concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) build up first in the fully expanded leaves where NaCl is compartmentalized in the vacuoles. Only after their loading capacity is surpassed, do the cytosolic and apoplasmic concentrations reach toxic levels, ultimately leading to loss of turgor, ergo plant death. It has been suggested that hyperacidification of the vacuolar lumen via the V-ATPase provides the extra protons required for a Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchange-activity leading to the detoxification of the cytosol (Tsiantis, M. S., et al, <highlight><italic>Plant J., </italic></highlight>9:729-736 (1996)). Salt stress increases both ATP- and pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> transport in tonoplast vesicles from sunflower seedling roots. Salt treatments also induce an amiloride-sensitive Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchange activity (Ballesteros, E., et al., <highlight><italic>Physiologia Plantarum, </italic></highlight>99:328-334 (1997)). In the halophyte Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, high NaCl stimulates the activities of both the vacuolar H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-ATPase (V-ATPase) and a vacuolar Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> antiporter in leaf cells. As described herein, the plant components involved in the intracellular detoxification system have been identified by complementing salt-sensitive mutants of the budding yeast <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae. </italic></highlight>As also described herein, <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>has been used as a host model plant to demonstrate that overexpression of these genes results in salt tolerance in the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention is directed to transgenic plants which are tolerant to one or more salts. As used herein, the term &ldquo;salt&rdquo; refers to any salt, such as NaCl, KCl, and/or CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. In one embodiment, the transgenic plants of the present invention comprise one or more plant cells transformed with exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant. Any suitable vacuolar pyrophosphatase, several of which have been cloned, can be used in the compositions and methods of the present invention (e.g., Sarasian, Z., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, </italic></highlight>89:1775-1779 (1992); Jenslerchl, et al., <highlight><italic>Molec. Biol., </italic></highlight>29: 833-840 (1995); Kim, Y., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol., </italic></highlight>106:375-382 (1994)). As used herein, nucleic acid which &ldquo;alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase&rdquo; includes nucleic acid which enhances (promotes) or inhibits expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the transgenic plant. In a particular embodiment, the present invention relates to a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt comprising an exogenous nucleic acid construct which is designed to overexpress AVP1 (Sarasian, Z., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, </italic></highlight>89:1775-1779 (1992)) or designed to downregulate endogenous vacuolar pyrophosphatase. The present invention also encompasses transgenic plants which grow in a concentration of salt that inhibits growth of a corresponding non-transgenic plant. Transgenic progeny of the transgenic plants, seeds produced by the transgenic plant and progeny transgenic plants grown from the transgenic seed are also the subject of the present invention. Also described herein are plant cells comprising exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Any suitable nucleic acid molecule which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant can be used to transform the transgenic plants in accordance with the present invention. Exogenous nucleic acid is a nucleic acid from a source other than the plant cell into which it is introduced or into a plant or plant part from which the tansgenic part was produced. The exogenous nucleic acid used for transformation can be RNA or DNA, (e.g., cDNA, genomic DNA). In addition, the exogenous nucleic acid can be circular or linear, double-stranded or single-stranded molecules. Single-stranded nucleic acid can be the sense strand or the anti-sense strand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The exogenous nucleic acid can comprise nucleic acid that encodes a vacuolar pyrophosphatase protein (an exogenous vacuolar pyrophosphatase), such as AVP1, a functional portion thereof (peptide, polypeptide), or a homologue thereof, and/or nucleic acid that alters (enhances, inhibits) expression of the endogenous vacuolar pyrophosphatase of the plant into which the exogenous nucleic acid is introduced. As used herein a &ldquo;functional portion&rdquo; of a nucleic acid that encodes a vacuolar pyrophosphatase protein is a portion of the nucleic acid that encodes a protein or polypeptide which retains a function characteristic of a vacuolar pyrophosphatase protein. In a particular embodiment, the nucleic acid encodes AVP1, a functional portion or a homologue thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid that alters (enhances, inhibits) expression of the endogenous vacuolar pyrophosphatase of the plant into which the exogenous nucleic acid is introduced includes regulatory sequences (e.g., inducible, constitutive) which function in plants and antisense nucleic acid. Examples of regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers and/or suppressors of vacuolar pyrophosphatase. The nucleic acid can also include, for example, polyadenylation site, reporter gene and/or intron sequences and the like whose presence may not be necessary for function or expression of the nucleic acid but can provide improved expression and/or function of the nucleic acid by affecting, for example, transcription and/or stability (e.g., of mRNA). Such elements can be included in the nucleic acid molecule to obtain optimal performance of the nucleic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid for use in the present invention can be obtained from a variety sources using known methods. For example, the nucleic acid encoding a vacuolar pyrophosphatase (e.g., AVP1) for use in the present invention can be derived from a natural source, such as tobacco, bacteria, tomato or corn. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid encodes a vacuolar pyrophosphatase that corresponds to a wild type of the transgenic plant. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid encodes a vacuolar pyrophosphatase that does not correspond to a wild type of the transgenic plant. Nucleic acid that alters (enhances, inhibits) expression of the endogenous vacuolar pyrophosphatase of the plant into which the exogenous nucleic acid is introduced (e.g., regulatory sequence) can also be chemically synthesized, recombinantly produced and/or obtained from commercial sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods for introducing the nucleic acid of the present invention into plants are known to those of skill in the art. For example, Agrobacteriummediated plant transformation, particle bombardment, microparticle bombardment (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,050; U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,792) protoplast transformation, gene transfer into pollen, injection into reproductive organs and injection into immature embryos can be used. The exogenous nucleic acid can be introduced into any suitable cell(s) of the plant, such a root cell(s), stem cell(s) and/or leaf cell(s) of the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a construct comprising a vacuolar pyrophosphatase gene operably linked to a promoter designed to overexpress the vacuolar pyrophosphatase (e.g., an expression cassette) or a construct designed to downregulate endogenous pyrophosphatase is used to produce the transgenic plants of the present invention. As used herein the term &ldquo;overexpression&rdquo; refers to greater expression/activity than occurs in the absence of the construct. In a particular embodiment, a construct comprising an AVP1 gene operably linked to a chimeric promoter designed to overexpress the AVP1 or designed to downregulate endogenous pyrophosphatase is used to produce the transgenic plants of the present invention. More particularly, the present invention relates to a construct wherein the AVP1 gene is operably linked to a double tandem enhancer of a 35S promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Any suitable plant can be used to produce the transgenic plants of the present invention. For example, tomato, corn, tobacco, rice, sorghum, cucumber, lettuce, turf grass, ornamental (e.g., larger flowers, larger leaves) and legume plants can be transformed as described herein to produce the transgenic plants of the present invention. In addition, the transgenic plants of the present invention can be grown in any medium which supports plant growth such as soil or water (hydroponically). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention also encompasses methods of making a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt. In one embodiment, the method comprises introducing into one or more cells of a plant exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells in the plant, thereby producing a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt. In another embodiment, the method comprises introducing into one or more cells of a plant a nucleic acid construct which is designed to overexpress AVP1 to yield transformed cells, thereby producing a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt. The methods of making a transgenic plant can further comprise regenerating plants from the transformed cells to yield transgenic plants and selecting a transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt. The transgenic plants produced by these methods are also encompassed by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The transgenic plants of the present invention are useful for a variety of purposes. As described herein, the plant components involved in an intracellular cation detoxification system have been identified by complementing salt-sensitive mutants of the budding yeast <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae. </italic></highlight>The present invention relates to a method of bioremediating soil comprising growing one or more transgenic plants and/or progeny thereof in the soil, wherein the transgenic plants and/or progeny thereof comprise exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of removing cations (e.g., monvalent and/or divalent cations) from a medium which can support plant growth (e.g., soil, water) comprising growing one or more transgenic plants and/or progeny thereof in the medium, wherein the transgenic plants and/or progeny thereof comprise exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant. For example, the method can be used to remove sodium (Na), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn) and/or calcium (Ca) ions from a medium which supports plant growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, it has been shown herein that the transgenic plants of the present invention are larger than the corresponding wild type plants (Example 3). Thus, the present invention provides for a method of increasing the yield of a plant comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells, thereby increasing the yield of the plant. The present invention also relates to a method of making a plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type plant comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells, thereby producing a transgenic plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type plant. The method can further comprise regenerating plants from the transformed cells to yield transgenic plants and selecting a transgenic plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type plant, thereby producing a transgenic plant which is larger than its corresponding wild type plant. Also encompassed by the present invention is a method of making a transgenic plant (e.g., an ornamental plant) having increased flower size compared to its corresponding wild type plant comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells, thereby producing a transgenic plant having increased flower size compared to its corresponding wild type plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides for a method of producing a transgenic plant which grows in salt water comprising introducing into one or more cells of a plant nucleic acid which alters expression of vacuolar pyrophosphatase in the plant to yield transformed cells, thereby producing a transgenic plant which grows in salt water. As used herein, &ldquo;salt water&rdquo; includes water characterized by the presence of salt, and preferably wherein the concentration of salt in the water is from about 0.2M to about 0.4M. In one embodiment, salt water refers to sea water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The transgenic plants of the present invention can also be used to produce double transgenic plants which are tolerant to salt wherein a plant is transformed with exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of a vacuolar phosphatase and exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of another protein involved in sequestration of cations and/or detoxification in plants. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a double transgenic plant which is tolerant to salt comprising one or more plant cells transformed with exogenous nucleic acid which alters expression of a vacuolar pyrophosphatase and an Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> antiporter in the plant. In one embodiment, the vacuolar pyrophosphatase is AVP1 or a homologue thereof and the Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> antiporter is AtNHX1 or a homologue thereof. The present invention further relates to a transgenic progeny of the double transgenic plant, as well as seeds produced by the transgenic plant and a progeny transgenic plant grown from the seed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Investigation of the role of intracellular organelles in cation homeostasis via the identification and manipulation of key transporters is described herein. Most of these intracellular organelles, including clathrin-coated vesicles, endosomes, Golgi membranes and vacuoles have acidic interiors (Xie, X. S., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>264:18870-18873 (1989)). This acidification is mediated by a proton-translocating electrogenic ATPase and in plant vacuoles also via a pyrophosphate-driven proton pump V-PPase (Davies, J. M., et al., The Bioenergetics of Vacuolar H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Pumps. In: Leigh R. A., Sanders, D., (<highlight><italic>eds</italic></highlight>) <highlight><italic>The Plant Vacuole</italic></highlight>, pp. 340-363, Academic Press, San Diego (1997); Zhen, R. G., et al., &ldquo;The Molecular and Biochemical Basis of Pyrophosphate-Energized Proton Translocation at the Vacuolar Membrane Academic Press Limited (1997)). There exists a requirement of anion transport to maintain net electroneutrality (al-Awqati, A., <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol., </italic></highlight>7:504-508 (1995)). The yeast member of the CLC voltage-gated chloride channel superfamily, Gef1, is required for copper loading in late-Golgi vesicles and for cation sequestration in the prevacuolar compartment in yeast (Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>95:4046-4050 (1998); Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>96:1480-1485 (1999); Example 1). Furthermore, it has been shown that the defects of gef1 mutants can be suppressed by the introduction of the prototype member of the CLC superfamily, the <highlight><italic>Torpedo marmorata CLC-</italic></highlight>0 or by the introduction of Arabidobsis thaliana CLC-c and CLC-d chloride channel genes (Hechenberger, M., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>271:33632-33638 (1996); Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>95:4046-4050 (1998)). While not wishing to be bound by theory, two observations led to the proposal of a model for Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> sequestration in yeast described herein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>). First, gef1 mutants are sensitive to high NaCl concentrations. Second, the Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>exchanger Nhx1 localized to the prevacuolar compartment (Nass, R., et al., <highlight><italic>J Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>273:21054-21060 (1998)). This model posits that Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> sequestration by Nhx1 depends on the vacuolar H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-ATPase and Gef1, the chloride channel. Gef1-mediated anion influx allows the establishment by the vacuolar H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-ATPase of a proton gradient sufficient in magnitude to drive the uphill accumulation of Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> via Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> This model is entirely consistent with the physiological data on the role of the vacuole in cation detoxification in higher plants. As described in Example 1, to test this sequestration model, mutant yeast strains (enal) lacking the plasma membrane sodium efflux pump, which therefore must rely on the internal detoxification system in order to grow on high salt, were constructed. In theory, increasing the influx of protons into the postulated endosomal compartment should improve Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> sequestration via the Nhx1 exchanger. In order to increase the H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> availability the A. thaliana gain-of-function mutant gene AVP1-D that codes for the vacuolar pyrophosphate-energized proton pump was expressed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>) (Zhen, R. G., et al., <highlight><italic>J Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>272:22340-22348 (1997)). This plant pump expressed in yeast restored the Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> resistance of the test strain, but only if the strain had functional NHX1 and GEF1 genes. Furthermore, Gef1p and Nhx1p colocalize within a common organelle, the prevacuolar compartment (Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>96:1480-1485 (1999)). These results strongly support the model in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> and indicate that the yeast prevacuolar compartment can be used to identify the elusive plant transporters involved intracellular sodium detoxification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Yeast and plant cells share pathways and signals for the trafficking of vesicles from the Golgi network to the vacuole (Neuhaus, J. M., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol., </italic></highlight>38:127-144 (1998); (Paris, N., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol., </italic></highlight>115:29-39 (1997); Sato, M. H., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>272:24530-24535 (1997); Vitale, A. V., et al., <highlight><italic>Trends Plant Sci., </italic></highlight>4:148-154 (1999)). As shown herein, intracellular Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> detoxification in yeast requires functional Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchanger (Nhx1) and chloride channel (Gef1), and they colocalize to a prevacuolar compartment (Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>USA, 96:1480-1485 (1999)). As described in Example 1, to further test the utility of this system, an Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of the yeast NHX1 gene (AtNHX1) was cloned and its function in the nhx 1 yeast mutant was tested. The AtNHX1 gene was able to suppress partially the cation sensitivity phenotypes of nhx1 mutants. Further support for the role of the Arabidopsis AtNHX1 gene in salt homeostasis came from the observation that its expression is induced in salt-stressed plants (Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>96:1480-1485 (1999)). A recent report shows that the overexpression of AtNHX1 gene in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana promotes sustained growth in soil watered with 200 mM NaCl plys 1/8 M.S. salts under short-day cycle conditions (Apse, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>285:1256-1258 (1999)). It is worth noting that every addition of 1/8 M.S. salts provides 2.5 mM potassium reducing the stringency of the NaCl stress, and that a shortday cycle reduces oxidative stress. As described in Example 2, transgenic plants that overexpress the AtNHX1 were generated (35SAtNHX1 transgenics). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In plants, most of the transport processes are energized by the primary translocation of protons. H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-translocating pumps located at the plasma membrane and tonoplast translocated H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> from the cytosol to extracellular and vacuolar compartments, respectively (Rea, P. A., et al., Tonoplast Adenosine Triphosphate and inorganic Pyrophosphatase. In: <highlight><italic>Methods Plant Biochem., pp. </italic></highlight>385-405, Academic Press Limited, London (1990)). The plant tonoplast contains two H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-translocating pumps; the V-ATPase and the inorganic pyrophosphatase or V-PPase. Their action results in luminial acidification and the establishment of a H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> electrochemical potential gradient across the tonoplast (Davies, J. M., et al., The Bioenergetics of Vacuolar H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> Pumps. In: <highlight><italic>Plant Vacuole</italic></highlight>, pp. 340-363, Leigh, R. A., Sanders, D. (eds.), Academic Press, San Diego (1997)). The vacuolar membrane is implicated in a broad spectrum of physiological processes that include cytosolic pH stasis, compartmentation of regulatory Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, sequestration of toxic ions such as Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, turgor regulation, and nutrient storage and retrieval. The vacuole constitute 40 to 99% of the total intracellular volume of a mature plant cell. The vacuolar proton pumping pyrophosphatase is a universal and abundant component of plant tonoplast capable of generating a steady-state transtonoplast H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> electrochemical potential similar or greater than the one generated by the V-ATPase (Rea, P. A., et al., Tonoplast Adenosine Triphosphate and Inorganic Pyrophosphatase. In: <highlight><italic>Methods Plant Biochem</italic></highlight>., pp. 385-405, Academic Press Limited, London (1990)). Pyrophosphate (PPi) is a by-product in the activation or polymerization steps of a wide range of biosynthetic pathways and in plants serves as an alternative energy donor to ATP for sucrose mobilization via sucrose synthase, for glycolysis via PPi: fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase and for tonoplast energisation via the vacuolar proton pumping pyrophosphatase (Stitt, M., <highlight><italic>Bot. Acta </italic></highlight>111:167-175 (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As described in Example 1, the overexpression of the <highlight><italic>A. Thaliana </italic></highlight>gain-of-function mutant gene AVP1-D increases the intracellular detoxification capability in yeast (Gaxiola, R. A., et al, Proc. Natl., Acad. Sci. USA, 96:1480-1485 (1999)). The rationale behind this approach is that an increased influx of H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> into the vacuolar compartment should improve Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> sequestration via the Nhx1 exchanger. As described in Example 3, in order to test this hypothesis in plants, a transgenic <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>plant was engineered to overexpress the AVP1 wild-type gene using the double tandem enhancer of the 35S promoter (Topfer, R., et al, <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acid Res., </italic></highlight>15:5890 (1987)). AVP1 encodes the pyrophosphate-energized vacuolar membrane proton pump from Arabidopsis (Zhen, R. G., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>272:22340-22348 (1997)). Previous investigations suggest that the AVP1gene is present in a single copy in the genome of Arabidopsis (Kim, Y., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol., </italic></highlight>106:375-382 (1994)), however, a sequence homologous, but not identical, to AVP1 on chromosome one has been tentatively designated as ORF F9K20.2 on BAC F9K20 by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Five different lines of 35SAVP1 plants showed an enhanced salt tolerance as compared to wild-type plants in the T2 stage. However, the most dramatic phenotype was apparent in the homozygous T3 plants. These transgenic plants are larger than wild-type plants. Furthermore, homozygous 35SAVP1 plants show sustained growth in the presence of 250 mM NaCl plus 1/8 M.S. salts when grown in a 24 hours light regimen. Interestingly, when 35SAVP1 plants were grown under short-day cycle conditions sustained growth in the presence of 300 mM NaCl plus 1/8 M.S. salts was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Hydroponic culture increases plant growth and provides stress-free root and shoot material (Gibeaut, D. M., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol., </italic></highlight>317-319 (1997)). Another important advantage of hydrophonic culture is that we can alter the ionic composition in a more accurate manner than in soil. These advantages could be important for the physiological studies of salt stress. As described in Example 4, wild type and 35SAVP1 transgenic plants were grown hydroponically. Under such conditions the size differences in root, leaves and stems among wild type and 35SAVP1 transgenic plants are dramatic. To learn about the salt tolerance of these plants under hydroponic conditions, NaCl concentration were increased stepwise by 50 mM every 4 days (Apse, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>285:1256-1258 (1999)). 35SAVP1 transgenic plants appear healthy in the presence of 200 mM NaCl while wild type controls show severe deleterious effects in their leaves and stems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Genetic engineering promises to transform modem agriculture. Salinization of soil due to irrigation has rendered much land unusable for crop production. Described herein is a strategy using genetic and molecular biological approaches to improve the intracellular Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> detoxification capabilities of crops. The fact that genetically engineered <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>plants that overexpress either AVP1 (the pyrophosphate-energized vacuolar membrane proton pump, this work) or AtNHX1 (the Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> antiporter, (Apse, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>285:1256-1258 (1999)) and this work) are capable of growing in the presence of 200 mM NaCl strongly supports the strategy described herein. It is likely that a double transgenic plant will show a further enhanced salt-tolerant phenotype. Furthermore, it is expected that these <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>transporters or their counterparts will be able to perform similar function in important agricultural crops. The increased size of 35SAVP1 Arabidopsis transgenic plants also contribute to future food security, namely potential yield increases in genetically engineered crops. </paragraph>

The ena1::HIS3 mutant was obtained from Fink Lab collection (L5709). Transformation was performed by using the lithium acetate method (Gietz, D., et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res., </italic></highlight>20:1425 (1992)). Double mutants RGY324 (gef1::HIS3 ena1::HIS3), RGY326 (nhx1::HIS3 ena1::HIS3), and RGY343 (gef1::HIS3 nhx1::HIS3) were obtained by crossing the single-mutant strains. Double mutants were identified among the meiotic progeny by scoring for the phenotypes associated with each of the single mutants. Sporulation, tetrad dissection, and mating types were scored as described (Guthrie C. and Fink, G.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The Arabidopsis Vacuolar H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-Pyrophosphatase (Avp1) Confers Salt Tolerance to Yeast enal Mutants. To determine the components of the intracellular system required for sodium detoxification, an enal mutant that lacks the plasma membrane sodium efflux pump and therefore must rely on the internal detoxification system to overcome sodium toxicity was used. Growth of the enal strain is sensitive to low concentrations of sodium (200 mM), concentrations that do not inhibit the growth of wild-type strains. The sequestration model (Nass, R. and Rao, R., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>273:21054-21060 (1998) and, Gaxiola, R. A., et al, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>95:4046-4050 (1998)) predicts that the enal strain would become salt tolerant if one could enhance the availability of protons in the postulated endosomal compartment. With increased influx of protons, cytoplasmic Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> would be sequestered via the Nhx1 exchanger. The yeast vacuolar ATPase is a multisubunit protein, so it is difficult to increase its activity by overexpressing any one of its subunits. However, it is possible to increase the influx of protons by expressing the <highlight><italic>A. thaliana </italic></highlight>AVP1 gene in yeast. This gene encodes a single polypeptide that, when expressed in yeast, is capable of pumping protons into the lumen of the vacuole (Kim, E. J., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>91:6128-6132 (1994)). To ensure maximum activity of this proton pump, the E229D gain-of-function mutant of the AVP1 gene (AVP1-D) that has enhanced H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> pumping capability was expressed (Zhen, R. G., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>272:22340-22348 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Overexpression of AVP1-D restored salt tolerance to salt-sensitive enal mutants. The restoration of salt tolerance to an enal strain by AVP1-D requires functional NHX1 and GEF1 genes: enalnhx1 AVP1-D and enal gef1 AVP1-D strains are salt sensitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Expression of Arabidopsis vacuolar pyrophosphatase AVP1 in enal mutants: Vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) was introduced into wild-type, ena1, ena1 nhx1, and ena1 gef1 mutants. Plasmid pYes2-AVP1-D (Zhen, R. G., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>272:22340-22348 (1997)) was introduced into enal, enal nhx1, and ena1 gef1 mutants. Five-fold serial dilutions (starting at 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>cells) of each strain were plated on YPGAL (1% yeast extract/2% peptone/2% galactose) with or without 0.5 M NaCl and incubated at 30&deg; C. for 2 days. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> show intracellular concentrations of Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>. Exponentially growing cells (wild-type and enal transformed with pYES2 vector and ena1, ena1 nhx1, and enal gef1mutants carrying pYes2-AVP1-D) were exposed to 0.7M NaCl or 6 hours. Total cell extracts were prepared (see Materials and Methods), and Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> concentrations were determined. There is a consistent reduction in total cell Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> in the enal AVP-D strain. The reason for this reduction is unknown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The intracellular Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> contents of wild-type strains and of strains carrying various mutations affecting sodium tolerance were determined after 6 h of exposure to media supplemented with 0.7 M NaCl (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>). The intracellular Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> content in the enal mutant is 8-fold higher than in the wild-type strain. The enal AVPD strain is salt-resistant, even though its intracellular Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> content is 4-fold higher than that of the wild type. In enal AVP1-D strains lacking either gef1 or nhx1 (i.e., enal gef1 or enal nhx1), the Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> content is not reduced to the extent that it is in GEF1 NHX1 strain. Taken together, the genetic and physiological data are consistent with the model that Nhx1, Gef1 and Avp1 cooperate to sequester sodium internally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The intracellular K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> content correlates with salt tolerance and is inversely correlated with the Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> content of our strains (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). The wild-type K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> concentration is &ap;100 mM but is reduced to 20 mM in the enal mutant. Interestingly, in an enal strain that overexpresses the AVP1-D gene, the intracellular concentration of K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> is restored almost to wild-type levels (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). However, AVP1-D overexpression fails to restore wild-type levels of intracellular potassium unless both NHx1 and GEF1 are functional (see the double mutants enal nhx1 or enal gef1 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The NHX1 and GEF1 genes, which have been identified as important in sodium detoxification, are also required for the detoxification of other cations. Growth of gef1 and nhx1 mutants in the presence of toxic cations: Five-fold serial dilutions (starting at 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>cells) of the indicated strains were grown at 30&deg; C. for 2 days on YPD (1% yeast extract/2% peptone/2% dextrose) with the addition of either 3 mM MnCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.45 M tetramethylammonium (TMA), or 0.05 mg/ml hygromycin B (HYG) as indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> For example, gef1 mutants are sensitive to 3 mM MnCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.45 M tetramethylammonium chloride and to 0.05 &mgr;g/ml hygromycin-B. The nhx1 mutant is also sensitive to tetramethylammonium chloride and hygromycin. The extreme sensitivity of the nhx1 mutant to hygromycin provides an important tool for assaying nhx1 function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Gef1p and Nhx1p Colocalize. The sequestration model postulates not only a functional connection between the anion channel Gef1 and sodium exchanger Nhx1 but also predicts that these two proteins colocalize within a common compartment. Because previous studies indicated that Nhx1 localizes to a prevacuolar compartment (Nass, R. and Rao, R., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>273:21054-21060 (1998)), two types of experiments were performed to determine whether Gef1 and Nhx1 proteins colocalize to this compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Distribution of fluorescence and immunodetection of subcellular fractions in gef1 nhx1 cells transformed with two constructs: a GEF1-GFP fusion and a NHX1-(HA)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-tagged fusion were determined. The strain RGY419 (gef1 nhx1) was transformed with plasmids pRG151; GEF1-GFP and pRIN73; NHX1-(HA)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Transformants were grown in SD (Difco; synthetic medium with 2% dextrose). When the cells reached OD<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.5, hygromycin B (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and the cells were incubated for 40 min at 30&deg; C. Cells were fixed and stained with antibodies to HA epitope and 4&prime;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were viewed by charge-coupled device microscopy and optically sectioned by using a deconvolution algorithm (Scanalytics, Billerica, Mass.) (Kennedy, B. K., et al, <highlight><italic>Cell, </italic></highlight>89:381-391 (1997)); (Bar&equals;1 &mgr;m.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It was found that hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Nhx1 and Gef1-GFP fusion protein colocalize as shown via epifluorescence deconvolution microscopy (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>). Persistence of signal coincidence on 90&deg; rotation of the image further supports colocalization of the two transporter proteins in these cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The colocalization of Nhx1 (HA)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and GEF1-GFP is also supported by the comigration of the two proteins in sucrose density gradients of membrane preparations obtained from cells expressing the tagged proteins. The strain RGY419 (gef1 nhx1) transformed with plasmids pRG151; GEF1-GFP and pRIN73; NHX1-(HA)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>was grown in APG medium (Rodriguez-Navarro, A. and Rea, P. A., J. Biol. Chem., 159:940-945 (1984)), converted to spheroplasts, lysed, and fractionated on a 10-step sucrose gradient (18-54%) as described (Sorin, A., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>272:9895-9901 (1997) and Antebi, A. and Fink, G. R., <highlight><italic>Mol. Biol. Cell, </italic></highlight>3:633-654 (1992)). Western blots showed the distribution of Gefl-GFP and Nhx1-HA (see Example 1, Materials and Methods). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The sedimentation behavior of the membrane fraction containing both proteins is consistent with that of a prevacuolar compartment (Nass, R. and Rao, R., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>273:21054-21060 (1998)). Gef1-GFP (but not Nhx1) is also present in Golgi fractions, consistent with previous studies (Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>95:4046-4050 (1998), Schwappach, B., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol.

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> An <highlight><italic>A. thaliana </italic></highlight>Homologue of NHX1 Functions in Yeast. The yeast strain described herein provides an important tool for identifying genes that mediate salt tolerance in other organisms. To test the utility of this system, a sequence from Arabidopsis (See Materials and Methods) with very high homology to the <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>NHX1 ORF was identified and used an expressed sequence tag (see Materials and Methods) to obtain a full-length clone of this Arabidopsis gene. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of Nhx1 homologues from Arabidopsis (AtNhx1), human (HsNhe6), and yeast (ScNhx1) reveals segments of amino acid identity and similarity within predicted transmembrane domains (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). However, it is important to note that despite these relationships, neither the&mdash;nor the C-terminal regions of AtNhx1 and ScNhx1 show a high degree of homology (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). A characteristic of mammalian Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> antiporters is their inhibition by amiloride. A putative amiloride binding site (<highlight><superscript>163</superscript></highlight>DVFFLFLLPPI<highlight><superscript>173</superscript></highlight>) (SEQ ID NO: 4) has been defmed via point mutants in the human NHE<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> antiporter gene (Counillon, L., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>90:4508-4512 (1993)). AtNhx1, HsNhe-6 and ScNhx1 have an almost identical sequence (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). However, our attempts to inhibit the activity of either Nhx1 or AtNhx1 in yeast cultures with amiloride were unsuccessful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The extreme sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants to hygromycin permitted the testing of whether the cloned Arabidopsis AtNHX1 ORF could provide Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchange function in yeast. Vector pAD4 (Ballester, R., et al., <highlight><italic>Cell, </italic></highlight>59:681-686 (1989) was introduced into wild-type and nhx1 strains. Plasmid pRG308; ADH; AtNHX1 was introduced into nhx1 mutants as indicated. Five-fold serial dilutions (starting at 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>cells) of the indicated strains were grown at 30&deg; C. for 2 days on YPD (&minus;) or on YPD supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml hygromycin (&plus;). Serial dilutions of the same strains were grown on APG medium (see Materials and Methods) (&minus;) or on APG supplemented with 0.4 M NaCl (Rodriguez-Navarro, A. and Ramos, J., <highlight><italic>J.

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The At NHX1 gene is capable of suppressing the hygromycin sensitivity of the nhx1 mutant. The AtNHX1 gene also suppressed the NaCl sensitivity of nhx1 mutant but only under conditions in which the K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> availability was reduced. However, AtNHX1 was not capable of rescuing the Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;&minus;</superscript></highlight> sensitive growth phenotype of the double mutant enal nhx1 overexpressing the AVP1-D gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Further support for the role of the Arabidopsis AtNHX1gene in salt homeostasis came from an analysis of its expression in salt-stressed plants. Plants were grown for 15 days under standard conditions and then exposed for 6 h to either 250 m NaCl or KCl. The NaCl stress increased AtNHX1 mRNA levels 4.2-fold, whereas KCl promoted only a 2.8-fold increase. This increase in mRNA level produced by sodium resembles that described for the yeast NHX1 gene (Nass, R. and Rao, R., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>273:21054-21060 (1998)). RNA tissue blot hybridized with AtNHX1. Ten micrograms of total RNA from 15-day old plants exposed to 250 mM NaCl or KCl for 6 h and a control grown without salt was subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing formaldehyde gel. The blot was hybridized with a probe internal to AtNHX1 ORF. An 18S ribosomal probe was used as a loading control. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The studies described herein provide evidence for the importance of the prevacuolar pH for intracellular Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> sequestration in yeast. Overexpression of the plant H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-pyrophosphatase (Avp1) confers salt tolerance to yeast only in those strains containing a functional chloride channel (Gefl) and the Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchanger (Nhx1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> These data support a model in which the Nhx1 Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchanger acts in concert with the vacuolar ATPase and the GEF1 anion channel to sequester cations in a prevacuolar compartment. Several studies suggest that the prevacuolar compartment may be derived both from the plasma membrane and the late Golgi. These vesicles are likely involved in the assembly of the vacuole or delivery of cargo to this organelle. It is reasonable to expect that these prevacuolar vesicles detoxify cations by sequestration, thereby lowering their concentrations in the cytoplasm and in other organelles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The yeast system described herein permits the functional assessment of diverse heterologous proteins in salt tolerance: chloride channels, H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> pumps, and Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchangers and other cation/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchnagers or cation/bicarbonate symporters. The system is robust and flexible. The function of the Arabidopsis chloride channels (Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>95:4046-4050 (1998), Hechenberger, M., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>271:33632-33638 (1996)), H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> pump, and Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchanger can be assayed in the corresponding yeast mutant. Despite the inability of At NHX1 to suppress all the phenotypes of the yeast nhx1 mutant, the fact that it suppresses some phenotypes, coupled with the DNA homology between AtNHX1 and yeast NHX1, indicates that the plant gene carries out a similar function to that of the yeast homologue. The observation that the AtNHX1 l gene suppresses the sensitivity of the nhx1 mutant to hygromycin but provides only a weak Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> detoxification phenotype could be a consequence either of differential regulation of the transporters in the two organisms or of distinct cation transport selectivities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The regulation of AtNHX1 by salt and the ability of the plant gene to suppress the yeast nhx1 mutant suggest that the mechanism by which cations are detoxified in yeast and plants may be similar. Indeed, previous work suggested that vacuolar sodium accumulation in salt-tolerant plants may be mediated by a tonoplast Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> antiporter that utilizes the proton-motive force generated by the vacuolar H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-ATPase (V-ATPase) and/or H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-translocating pyrophosphatase (V-PPase; refs.

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The finding described herein that both gef1 and nhx1 mutants are hypersensitive to hygromycin indicate that the level of resistance to hygromycin depends on the function of the vacuolar and prevacuolar organelles. Yeast mutants impaired in K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> uptake (trk1) are hypersensitive to hygromycin (Madrid, R., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem., </italic></highlight>273:14838-14844 (1998)); reduced K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> uptake hyperpolarizes the plasma membrane potential and drives the uptake of alkali cations such as hygromycin. Mutations that reduce the H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> pumping activity of the plasma membrane H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-ATPase, Pmal, depolarize the plasma membrane potential and confer resistance to hygromycin (McCusker, J.

Thus, mutants such as gef1 or nhx1 that affect the pH or membrane potential of the vacuolar and prevacuolar compartments may be expected to affect hygromycin compartmentation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Overexpression of the pyrophosphate-energized vacuolar membrane proton pump AVP1 likely increases the availability of H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> in the lumen of the vacuole, and the AtNHX1 Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> antiporter uses these H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> to sequester Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> cations into the vacuole. Therefore, higher expression of these transporters likely maximizes the sequestration capability of the vacuole. To generate transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress both genes AVP1 and AtNHX1, T3 35S AVP1 plants are used as females and T3 35S AtNHX1 plants are used as males. Female plants are hand-emasculated and anthers from freshly opened flowers of donor plants are harvested. With these anthers the emasculated plants are pollinated by touching the anthers onto the stigmas. The pollinated flowers are labeled and any remaining opened or unopened flowers from the same female plant are removed to avoid any confusion at harvest. The harvested seeds are sterilized using a 50% sodium hypochloride solution and mixed vigorously for 5 minutes and rinsed with water thoroughly. The sterilized seeds are stored in soft agar over night at 4&deg; C. Then they are sprinkled onto solidified kanamycin-hygromycin selective medium. The 35S AVP1 construct has the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene that confers kanamycin tolerance in plants while the 35SAtNHX1 construct has a modified hygromycin B phosphotransferase that confers hygromycin tolerance in plants. The resistant seedlings are transplanted into soil and to the hydroponic media to be tested for their salt-tolerant phenotype. <highlight><italic>A transgenic Arabidopsis </italic></highlight>thaliana plant to overexpress the <highlight><italic>A. thaliana </italic></highlight>gain-of-function mutant gene AVP1-D (Zhen, et al., <highlight><italic>J.

These plants are characterized in parallel with the 35SAVP1, 35S AtNHX singles and doubles trangenics. The A. thaliana gain-of-function mutant gene AVP1-D is subcloned into plasmid pRT103 carrying the 35S promoter and the polyadenylation signal of CaMV (Topfer, R., et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl Acid Res., </italic></highlight>15:5890 (1997)). A HindIII fragment containing the chimeric 35SAVP-D gene is subcloned into pBIBhyg (Becker, D., <highlight><italic>Nucl Acid Res., </italic></highlight>18:203 (1990)). The resulting T-DNA vector is transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 via electroporation, and used for subsequent vacuum infiltration of <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>ecotype Columbia (Bechtold, N., et al., <highlight><italic>C.R.

The assay media contains 300 &mgr;M Tris-PPi, 50 mK KC1, 2.5 &mgr;M acridine orange, 5 mM Tris-Mes (pH 8.0). Intravesicular acidification is triggered with the addition of 1.3 mM MgSO4 and terminated with the addition of the protonophore FCCP at 2.5 &mgr;M.

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The shoot meristems labeling index is compared with one of the wild-type plants. Morphological and anatomical observations measuring and counting cells of leaves, roots and stems are performed. To determine if 35S AVP1 transgenic plants are larger because they have more cells, their shoot meristems labeling index is compared with the one of wild-type plants. To measure the DNA synthesis or cell proliferation 5-Bromo-2&prime;-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) that can be incorporated into DNA in place of thymidine is used. Cells that have incorporated BrdU into DNA are detected using a monoclonal antibody against BrdU monoclonal antibody and an anti-mouse Ig-alkaline phosphatase as a second antibody. The bound anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody is visualized by light microscopy and the ratio between DAPI stained and BrdU positives established. The protocol is a modification of the one published by Chiatante and coworkers (Levi, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Physiol. Plant. </italic></highlight>71:68-72 (1987)) and the BrdU labeling and detection kit II from Boehringer Mannheim. The plants are exposed for different times to the BrdU labeling medium and then fixation, paraffin embedding and sectioning is performed as described by Meyerowtz and coworkers (Drews, G., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol.

The generation of a good collection of tagged knockouts by Sussman and coworkers (Krysan, P., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The phenotypes of the above knock-outs will shed light towards the understanding of the physiological roles of these transporters in normal and stress conditions. An initial characterization of the knockout plants includes testing for their salt tolerance and their Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> ratios.

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The studies described herein together with other evidence strongly indicate that yeast and plants share pathways and signals for the trafficking of vesicles from Golgi network to the vacuole (Gaxiola, R., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>96:1480-1485 (1999); Marty, F., &ldquo;The Biogenesis of Vacuoles: Insights from Microscopy.

A. and Sanders, D., Academic Press, San Diego (1997); Bassham, D.C., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol, </italic></highlight>117:407-415 (1998)). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is likely that in both systems a prevacuolar compartment is a dynamic entity that detoxifies the cytoplasm from toxic cations and delivers its cargo either to the vacuole, or directly to the cell exterior. Both the Gef1 chloride channel and Nhx1 Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchanger have been localized to the yeast prevacuolar compartment (Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>96:1480-1485 (1999)). The behavior of the Gef1-GFP chimera in yeast cells in vivo have been monitored indicating that its localization varies depending the environmental conditions. Furthermore, it has been shown that two of the four A. thaliana CLC chloride channel genes CLC-c and -d are capable of suppressing gef1 mutant phenotypes implying a similar localization (Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>95:4046-4050 (1998)). In order to understand how and where this cation detoxification takes place in plant cells the intracellular localization of GFP chimeras of AVP1, AtNHX1 and AtCLC-c and -d (Hong, B., et al., Plant Physiol., 119:1165-1175 (1999)) is monitored in vivo. Confocal microscopy is also used to address colocalization of the different transporters. For this purpose HA-tagged versions or antibodies of the transporters under study are required (Guiltinan, M. J., et al., <highlight><italic>Meth. Cell Biol., </italic></highlight>49:143-151 (1995); Jauh, G. -Y., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell, </italic></highlight>11:1867-1882 (1999); Mullen, R.

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> For the constructions of the GFP-chimeras the soluble versions GFP with improved fluorescence in A. thaliana reported by Davis and Viestra (Davies, S. J., Viestra, R. D., &ldquo;Soluble derivatives of green fluorescent protein (GFP) for use in <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana, http://brindabella.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/IndexGFP.html (</italic></highlight>1998)) are used. Two types of GFP-chimeras are made, namely a set under the regulation of the native promoter and another set under the regulation of the 35S promoter. The resulting T-DNA vectors containing the GFP-chimeras are transformed into <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>strain GV3101 via electroporation, and used for subsequent vacuum infiltration of <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>ecotype Columbia (Bechtold, N., et al., <highlight><italic>C.

For the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tagging a PCR strategy designed for yeast but modified to tag plant genes expressed in yeast vectors is used. Futcher and coworkers designed vectors containing the URA3 yeast gene flanked by direct repeats of epitope tags (HA) (Schneider, B. L., et al., Yeast, 11:1265-1274 (1995)). Via PCR the tag-URA3-tag cassette is amplified such that the resulting PCR fragment possess homology at each end to the gene of interest. In vivo recombination in yeast is then used to direct the integration of the PCR-chimera to the plasmid carrying the plant ORF of interest, transformants are selected by the URA<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> phenotype. The URA3 gene is &ldquo;popped out&rdquo; when positive transformants are grown in the presence of 5-fluoro-orotic acid. The vector carrying the plant gene has a selection marker different than the URA3 gene. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Gain of function mutants of the AtNHX that enhance salt tolerance of transgenic plants are generated using the yeast system. This is accomplished by mutagenizing the cloned gene to make a mutant library. This library is used to transform the salt sensitive yeast mutant enal and clones with an enhanced salt tolerant phenotype will be identified and retested. The other genes that show similarity to the AtNHX1 gene reported by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AG1) are expressed in yeast. It is likely that some of these AtNHX1 homologues are plasma membrane transporters, so their function in yeast should be pH dependent. Thus the precise composition and pH of the medium used for screening is crucial for success. Identification of plasma membrane transporters helps to engineer plants with an enhanced salt tolerance due to a reduced sodium uptake. In addition, plant cDNA expression libraries in yeast are used to identify other families of transporters involved in NaCl detoxification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To generate gain of function mutants of the AtNHX a method for introducing random mutations developed by Stratgene (Epicurian Coli XL1-Red competent Cells Cat&num;200129) is used. The method involves the propagation of a cloned gene into a strain deficient in the three primary DNA repair pathways. The random mutation rate in this strain is about 5000-fold higher than that of wild-type. A library of the mutated AtNHX gene is transformed into the enal yeast mutant and screened for salt tolerance. Yeast transformation is performed as described by Schiestl and coworkers (Gietz, D., et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl Acid Res. </italic></highlight>20:1425 (1992)). An alternative to the XL1-Red random mutagenesis strategy is a PCR approach described by Fink and coworkers (Madhani, H. D., et al., <highlight><italic>Cell, </italic></highlight>91:673-684 (1997)). To test AtNHX1 homologues the same strains and conditions used for AtNHX1 (Gaxiola, R. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>96:1480-1485 (1999)) are used initially. However, if these screening strains and/or conditions do not work new ones are worked out. It is likely that when dealing with plasma-membrane AtNHXl homologues pH conditions of the assay media are crucial. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The reduced availability of fresh water for standard agriculture may force the use of alternative agricultural arts. It is conceivable that with salt tolerant crops the use of hydroponics with seawater will create a new era in crop production. As described herein, conditions for hydroponics culture of Arabidopsis plants have been established and their performance in increasing concentrations of NaCl in their media have been tested. Transgenic plants are challenged with a commercial seawater formula that contains the complete ionic composition present in the oceans. 35SAVP1, 35SAtNHX1 single and double transgenics are grown together with wildtype Arabidopsis thaliana plants under hydroponic conditions for four weeks in a short day illumination cycle (Gibeaut, D. M., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol., </italic></highlight>317-319 (1997)). Then every four days an equivalent to 50 mM NaCl of Tropic Marin sea salt (www.thatpetplace.com) is added. This artificial sea water mix includes all of the other major and trace elements present in real sea water. Growth is monitored and physiological parameters, such as sodium content and distribution is determined as described in previous sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The effects of the overexpression of these <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>proton transporters (AVP1 and AtNHX1) in more agriculturally important plants such as tomato are examined. The tomato homologues of AVP1 and AtNHX1 are isolated and the corresponding chimeras to overexpress them are constructed (Bidone, S., et al., <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Biochem., </italic></highlight>253: 20-26 (1998); Burbidge, A., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Exper. Botany, </italic></highlight>48:2111-2112 (1997)). The genes are introduced via Agrobacterium-mediated infection of calli. Tissue culture methods are used to regenerate transformed plants. The plants are assayed for salt tolerance as well as physiological parameters, such as sodium content and distribution. Increasing the salt-tolerance of tomato plants will likely have important economic repercussions. A positive result indicates that the sequestration model described herein is also applicable to an important crop. Tomato transformation with 35S AVP1 and with 35S AtNHX1 constructs is performed as described by McCormick (McCormick, S., Transformation of tomato with <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic></highlight>. In: <highlight><italic>Plant Tissue Culture Manual, </italic></highlight>pp. 1-9, Lindsey, K. (ed.), Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands (1991)). T0 and T1 transgenics are analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and DNA gel blotting for the presence and copy number of AVP1 and AtNHX1 transgenes. Heterozygous and homozygous plants are identified after segregation analysis of each transcend within T1 seeds. Homozygous plants are assayed for salt tolerance and as well as physiological parameters, such as sodium content and distribution. Degenerated oligos based on conserved sequences present in AVP1 and AtNHX1 homologues are designed. These degenerated primers are used in RT-PCR reactions with cDNAs made from poly(A)&plus;RNA from tomato. The resulting PCR fragments are used as probes to isolate the full length cDNA clones from commercial libraries (i.e. Stratagene Cat&num;936004). A similar strategy was described by Caboche and coworkers (Quesada, A., et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol., </italic></highlight>34:265-274 (1997)). </paragraph>

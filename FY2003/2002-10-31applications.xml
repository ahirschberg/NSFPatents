<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A new mold solves problems that arise from differential changes in geometry inherent to casting metal in a ceramic mold, by control of the internal morphology between the surfaces of the mold that face the casting, and that face the external environment. Layered fabrication techniques are used to create a ceramic mold. For example, an internal geometry composed of a cellular arrangement of voids may be created within the mold wall. Structures may be designed and fabricated so that the ceramic mold fails at an appropriate time during the solidification and/or cooling of the casting. Thus, the casting itself is not damaged. The mold fails to avoid rupture, or even distortion, of the casting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0002" lvl="0">A thin shell of ceramic defines the casting cavity. This shell must be thin enough to fail due to the stresses induced (primarily compressive) by the metal next to it and partly adherent to it. A support structure is provided with a morphology that supports the thin shell that defines the casting geometry, yet that also fails as the casting solidifies and/or cools. Typically, the support structure is a skeletal network with voids therebetween. The skeletal elements may be struts, or sheets or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0003" lvl="0">At least the following two failure mechanisms may be exploited in the design of the support structure: bending in the structure; and under compressive loads, either by buckling of a support member or, breakage under compressive loading. The failure of the support structure may also be due to a combination of bending and compression. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to casting and more specifically metal casting using ceramic containing molds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A substantial number of metal castings are created by pouring molten metal into a ceramic mold. In sand casting, the mold is typically made of sand, held together with various binders. In investment casting, the mold is typically made of refractories, such as alumina powder, bound together by silica. A significant problem relates to a discrepancy in the change in the dimensions of the ceramic mold and the forming metal within the mold, as the casting cools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The problem has two aspects. First, as most metals solidify from liquid, there is a significant volume change, generally a shrinkage, on the order of 5%, by volume. Second, the coefficient of thermal expansion of metals is typically substantially higher than that of ceramics. Thus, as the solidified casting continues to cool, the metal will shrink more than the ceramic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Both these effects can lead to rupture or distortion of the casting. As the casting freezes, it is quite weak, and at that stage, can actually be torn apart by the constraints imposed by the ceramic mold. Such a failure is called a &ldquo;hot tear,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hot crack.&rdquo; As the casting continues to cool, it can be distorted by the constraints imposed by the ceramic mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Significant effort is expended in the casting art toward minimizing the difficulties imposed by the differential in change in dimension. Such efforts include control over the melt feeding pattern and freezing pattern through the use of risers and chills. In investment casting, the composition of the shell may be tailored, to promote its breakage during the cooling phase of the casting operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Typically a mold is made by providing a pattern whose outside shape is the shape of the object to be made. The pattern is made of a material that will burn away at a later stage. This pattern is dipped into a ceramic slurry, which forms a coating thereon. The coated shell is subsequently dipped in a different ceramic slurry, with different properties from the first ceramic slurry. The coated shell is dipped again and again into a succession of slurries, each being different from the previous slurry and the pattern is removed. The result is a hollow body coated with a succession of different coatings, much like layers of onion skin (except that the center of the body is hollow). The designer chooses the different coatings with the hope that they will themselves rupture, as the casting cools, thereby preventing the casting from distorting. Additional customization to promote or prevent mold rupture at specific locations can be provided by causing the shell to be thicker in certain locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Typically, the innermost layer is composed of a relatively fine grained ceramic slurry. Each subsequently applied slurry will typically be composed of coarser ceramic particles, such that each layer is successively coarser than the previous. The resultant body is porous. The distribution of particles and particle free void regions is uniform in each layer, and random within that layer, depending on the size and shape and uniformity of particles in the slurry, as well as the liquid content, both quantitative and qualitative. The voids are approximately the same size as the particles, and typically particles of any given layer can not pass through the voids in that layer. Further, the designer can not specify where in any layer, relative to the location of features in the casting, particles or voids will reside. Further, the designer has limited, if any, control over how, or where in the ceramic slurry coatings, relative to the features in the casting, the mold will break. The pattern of solid particles and voids within a layer is not predetermined or controllable, or repeatable in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Typically if the mold is made, and it breaks prematurely, or in the wrong place, the designer will change the next attempt by using different coatings, or by increasing the thickness in different locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The following illustrates the problem quantitatively. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Phase Change </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As the molten metal solidifies, it contracts. It is important to note that this contraction results from the phase change, not a temperature change, which is discussed below. For example, aluminum contracts by between 3.5 and 8.5%, by volume (or equivalently, between about 1.2 and 3.8% in linear dimension) upon solidification. Nickel alloys contract approximately 3% by volume upon solidification. (ASM Handbook, Volume 15, p. 768 (aluminum) and p. 822 (nickel).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In an extreme case, a casting may contract by this full amount upon solidification. More typically, a mold is designed with &ldquo;risers,&rdquo; which continue to feed molten metal to the casting as it cools, to minimize the impact of the solidification shrinkage. However, in castings of complex geometry, such approaches often do not fully compensate for the shrinkage and some dimension change of the casting results. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Temperature Change </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As the casting continues to cool, after solidification, it contracts further. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion of aluminum alloys and nickel alloys are approximately 20&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6</superscript></highlight>/&deg; C. and 14&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6</superscript></highlight>/&deg; C., respectively. Ceramic mold materials contract far less. For example, in the range of 200-1200&deg; C., the coefficient of thermal expansion of alumina is approximately 7&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6</superscript></highlight>/&deg; C. and that of fused silica is approximately 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6</superscript></highlight>/&deg; C. Thus, for example, when an aluminum casting cools in a ceramic mold made of alumina from a solidification temperature of 630&deg; C. to room temperature, the linear shrinkage of the metal is approximately 1.25% (after solidification) but the ceramic only shrinks approximately 0.4%. Thus, for example, a casting of 10 inch dimension (25.4 cm) will shrink 0.09 in. (0.22 cm) more than the mold that is containing it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, the difference in the degree of shrinkage of the casting upon solidification and the shrinkage of the casting after solidification due to cooling on the one hand, at the same time as the degree of shrinkage in the the mold on the other hand may cause ruptures or distortions in the casting, or mold rupture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Such failure of the mold is uncontrolled and usually harmful. For instance, it may occur while the molding material is still liquid, or flowable, thereby resulting in leakage of the molding material from the mold. Or, it may occur at a location that does not provide the stress relief to the casting that is required. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention solves the problems that arise from the differential changes in geometry inherent to casting metal in a ceramic mold, by control of the internal morphology. By &ldquo;internal morphology&rdquo; it is meant, between the surfaces of the mold that face the casting, and that face the external environment. Specifically, layered fabrication techniques are used to create a ceramic mold. Control may be exercised, not just over the geometry of the inner and outer walls of the mold themselves, but also of the morphology of the structure between the walls. For example, an internal geometry composed of a cellular arrangement of skeletal elements and voids may be created within the mold wall. Through such control of the internal morphology, structures may be designed and fabricated so that the ceramic mold is virtually guaranteed to fail at an appropriate time during the solidification and/or cooling of the casting. Thus, the casting itself is not damaged. As used herein in the context of the mold, &ldquo;to fail&rdquo; means to break, rupture or bend past an elastic limit. If a structure &ldquo;fails&rdquo; under a loading condition, it will not return to its original form after the loads are removed. The goal of the present invention is to design and control the mold to fail (break, rupture or bend past an elastic limit) and thus to avoid rupture, or even distortion, of the casting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Such collapsing molds of the invention typically consist of a thin layer of ceramic, which defines the casting cavity. This layer must be thin enough to fail due to the stresses induced (primarily compressive) by the metal next to it and partly adherent to it. Such a thin layer, however, would not be strong enough to be manipulated, handled or to enable transport of the mold before use, or to withstand the pressure and forces of the molten metal during pouring of the casting. Thus another aspect of the present invention is to include a support structure with a morphology that supports the thin wall that defines the casting geometry, yet that also fails as the casting solidifies and/or cools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> At least the following two failure mechanisms may be exploited in the design of the support structure: failure by bending in the structure; and failure under compressive loads, either by buckling of a support member or, more likely by the breakage of the member under the compressive loading. The breakage of the support structure may also be due to a combination of bending and compression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Thus, the designer has total control over where in the mold, relative to the locations of features in the casting, skeletal elements are, and also how they are oriented. Thus, the designer has total control over where, relative to the locations of features in the casting, the mold will be more likely to fail, and thus to avoid damage to the casting at even the most delicate of features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the invention is a mold for casting a part made from a molding material, such as metal, which material experiences dimensional change during a mold process. The mold comprises a thin inner shell, which defines a three dimensional cavity that will establish locations of features of the casting part, is impervious to flow of liquid molding material therethrough, and is configured to not fail under any stresses arising within the inner shell due to pouring of the liquid molding material into the cavity. The shell is, however, configured to fail under stresses arising within the inner shell as any such molding material solidifies or cools. The mold also includes a three-dimensional support body that supports the inner shell. The support body is defined by an internal structure of supporting skeletal elements in predetermined locations and orientations relative to features of the casting part, and voids between the skeletal elements. Like the shell, it is configured to not fail under any stresses arising within the support body due to pouring of the liquid molding material into the cavity; but it is configured through the locations and orientations of the skeletal elements within its internal structures to fail at predetermined regions relative to the locations of features of the casting part, under stresses arising within the support body as any such molding material solidifies and cools. The stresses within the support body and the shell that arise during a molding process are due to at least one phenomena of: any dimensional change of any molding material residing in the cavity upon solidification; and a difference between the coefficients of thermal expansion of the support body on the one hand and any such molding material on the other hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The support body is typically contiguous with the inner shell. The skeletal elements are arranged such that during any dimensional changes of the molding material, enough of the skeletal elements would fail to prevent distortions to the part being cast. Failure may be by bending, compression, or buckling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Typically, the support body is a cellular body, which may have rectilinear cells, either equal or unequal in size. There is also typically a continuous open path from within each cell to outside the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the support is composed of ceramic powder particles that have been joined together. The voids in the support body typically have a linear dimension that exceeds three times the average linear dimension of the powder particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The support body may comprise photocurable polymer loaded with ceramic particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Frequently, the skeletal elements and voids are arranged in at least one story, which story comprises a course connected to struts, which are connected to the thin inner shell. The support structure typically comprises a plurality of stories, each of which comprises a course, connected to struts, which are connected to an adjacent story. The skeletal elements may be struts, lattice elements (which are similar) or sheets, or any combination thereof. The mold may include an outer shell that contacts an outermost story. The inner shell may have an open boundary with which the support body is not contiguous, thereby forming a tub-like mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, in a specified region, the struts have a cross-sectional area of b<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and are spaced from adjacent struts a distance w. They are sized and spaced such that the ratio b/w is greater than the square root of the ratio of the hydrostatic pouring pressure of the molding material, over the minimum compressive strength of the material from which the struts are made. Such a mold will not fail under the charging of the mold with mold material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Further, in another related preferred embodiment, adjacent a specified region of the casting, where the casting has a feature having a linear dimension D, the struts have a cross-sectional area of b<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>and each strut has a length L, and a neutral axis located a distance h from a surface of the strut which is under maximum tensile load. The struts are made from a material having an elastic modulus E, and the relative strain between the casting and the thin shell is &egr;<highlight><subscript>R</subscript></highlight>. The struts are sized and shaped further such that the maximum tensile breaking strength of the struts is less than

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An alternative version of a preferred embodiment of the invention is a mold comprising a thin inner shell that defines a three dimensional cavity that will establish locations of features of the casting part. The mold also includes a three-dimensional foraminous support body that is contiguous with and substantially surrounds the inner shell. The support body is constructed of skeletal elements with voids therebetween, the voids comprising a network having an open pathway from each void to outside the support body and the skeletal elements being positioned and oriented according to a designed morphology at predetermined regions relative to the locations of features of the casting part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Many of the features of the embodiments discussed above are also aspects of this embodiment of the mold of the invention. The skeletal elements may be ceramic. The skeletal elements may be arranged in cells, as discussed above. The struts and sheets of the support body may have a cross-section that varies along their length and may be straight or curved. Furthermore, the skeletal elements and voids may be arranged to provide a predetermined pattern of heat transfer from any casting material as it cools to form a part to be made with the mold, which heat transfer varies at different locations in the pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Yet another preferred embodiment of the invention is a method of making a mold using a solid free form layered fabrication technique. The method comprises the steps of: providing a machine readable model of a mold geometry comprising a thin shell and a support body, in accordance with any of the embodiments described above, and using the model to drive a solid free form layered fabrication machine, building up, by layers, a mold that is defined by the geometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The step of building up, by layers, may comprise the steps of depositing a layer of a powder material in a confined region and then applying a further material to one or more selected regions of the layer of powder material which will cause the layer of powder material to become bonded at the one or more selected regions that will become the inner shell and a plurality of skeletal elements of the support body. The steps of depositing powder and applying further material are repeated a selected number of times to produce a selected number of successive layers. The further material causes the successive layers to become bonded to each other to form the inner shell and the skeletal elements of the support body. The method also includes the step of removing unbonded powder material which is not at the one or more selected regions, to form the cavity and voids between the skeletal elements. The powder is removed through passageways that exist between the voids and the outside of the mold. Molding material is introduced to the inner shell through a passage provided for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of this embodiment of the invention, the model of the mold comprises a rectilinear cellular body defined by substantially parallel planar stories. The repeated step of depositing a layer of powder material may comprise depositing a layer in a plane that is either substantially parallel to or oblique to the substantially parallel stories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A related aspect of such an embodiment includes providing a model of skeletal elements arranged to provide a predetermined pattern of heat transfer from any casting material as it cools to form a part to be made with the mold, which heat transfer varies at different locations in the pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In accordance with various preferred embodiments of the invention, the free form layered fabrication technique may be any of: Three Dimensional Printing, Selective Laser Sintering, Stereo Lithography, CAM-LEM, Fused Deposition Modeling and Ballistic Particle Manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The method of making a mold also includes providing a model having skeletal elements sized, shaped and spaced as described above, to ensure that the mold will support the molding material as it is poured into the cavity, and so that it will also fail as the molding material solidifies and cools, to avoid its damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Still another preferred embodiment of the invention is a method of molding a part. The method comprises the steps of providing a mold that has an inner shell and a support body, according to any of the embodiments described above, made according to any of the methods described above. The method further entails providing liquid molding material in the cavity and maintaining the mold under conditions such that the molding material solidifies into the part; and such that the solidified part and the mold cools. The method further requires maintaining the shell and supporting body such that both fail at predetermined regions relative to the locations of features of the casting part, as the molding material experiences dimensional change, and such that the molding material deforms less than its yield strain as it solidifies and cools. Finally, the failed mold is removed from the solidified, cooled part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the method of providing the mold is a method of providing layers of powdered material, as described above. Typically, the powdered material is a ceramic material, and the molding material is a metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The mold will typically fail before any features of the casting if certain requirements are met. In a specified region of the support body, adjacent where a feature of the casting has a linear dimension D, the skeletal elements comprise struts, each strut having a length L, a cross-sectional area of b<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and a neutral axis located a distance h from a surface of the strut which is under maximum tensile load. If the strut is made from a material having an elastic modulus E, and if they are spaced from adjacent struts a distance w, and if the relative strain between the casting material and the thin shell is &egr;<highlight><subscript>R</subscript></highlight>, then the struts should be sized and spaced such that the tensile breaking strength of the struts is less than

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A preferred general embodiment of the invention is shown schematically with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 1A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In general, an embodiment of the invention contemplates that a mold will be fabricated using a Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) process, which allows parts to be created directly from computer models. SFF processes that are commonly used include Three Dimensional Printing (&ldquo;3D Printing&rdquo;) stereolithography (&ldquo;SLA&rdquo;), selective laser sintering (&ldquo;SLS&rdquo;), CAM-LEM, a variant of laminated object manufacturing (&ldquo;CAM-LEM&rdquo;), Ballistic Particle Manufactoring (&ldquo;BPM&rdquo;) and fused deposition modeling (&ldquo;FDM&rdquo;). These processes all differ from traditional machining, since material is added to the desired part, as opposed to material being removed, as with milling, turning, and boring. </paragraph>

All of the foregoing 3D Printing patent applications (and provisional applications) are incorporated herein fully by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A typical implementation of the 3D Printing process begins with the definition of a three-dimensional geometry using computer-aided design (&ldquo;CAD&rdquo;) software. This CAD data is then processed with software that slices the model into many thin layers, which are essentially two-dimensional. A physical part is then created by the successive printing of these layers to recreate the desired geometry. An individual layer is printed by first spreading a thin layer of powder and then printing binder to adhere the powder together in selected regions to create the desired layer pattern. The growing part is lowered by a piston and a new layer of powder is spread on top. This process is repeated until all the layers have been printed. The binder joins powder together within a layer and between layers. After printing is complete, the unbound powder is removed, leaving a part with the desired geometry. Typically the part is a green part that will experience further processing, such as sintering. However, in some circumstances, the part may be a final part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> There are many different powder and binder systems, based on metal, or ceramic or polymer powder. The part can be sintered or infiltrated to full density. Because 3D Printing is an additive manufacturing process, many geometries are possible that are not feasible with traditional machining, such as undercuts and internal cavities. Furthermore, many materials can be used in the 3D Printing process, as long as they can be obtained in powdered form. Currently, work has been done using metal, polymer, ceramic, and glass-ceramic powders. Using these materials, a wide variety of parts have been produced. This includes, injection molding tooling, casting shells, and structural ceramics. Parts, such as tooling, can incorporate cooling channels that are conformal to casting surfaces to decrease cycle time and residual stresses in parts made with such tooling. Other types of parts can also include such channels. Using the 3D Printing process, it is also possible to make individual parts with regions composed of varying materials (functionally gradient materials). This can be achieved by printing different materials into selected regions of an individual layer. This extra degree of freedom allows designers to vary the material properties within a single part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The other SFF techniques have various properties, advantages and disadvantages, which are generally known. See generally, Prinz, F. B. et al, JTEC/WTEC PANEL REPORT ON RAPID PROTOTYPING IN EUROPE AND JAPAN, Volume 1, Analytical Chapters, Rapid Prototyping Association of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Baltimore, Md.: Loyola College, Mar. 1, 1997, which is incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion uses 3D Printing to illustrate the general principals of the embodiments of the invention. However, the other SFF techniques can also be used. Some important features that are specific to others of these techniques are discussed below, after the general discussion of the embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention solves the problems that arise from the differential changes in geometry inherent to casting metal in a ceramic mold, by control of the internal morphology of the ceramic mold. By &ldquo;internal morphology&rdquo; it is meant, between the surfaces of the mold that face the casting, and that face the external environment. Specifically, layered fabrication techniques are used to create a ceramic mold. Control may be exercised, not just over the geometry of the inner and outer walls of the mold themselves, but also of the morphology of the structure between the walls. For example, an internal geometry composed of a cellular arrangement of voids may be created within the mold wall. Through such control of the internal morphology, structures may be designed and fabricated such that the ceramic mold is virtually guaranteed to fail at an appropriate time during the solidification and/or cooling of the casting. Thus, the casting itself is not damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As used herein, in the context of the mold, &ldquo;to fail&rdquo; means to break, rupture or bend past an elastic limit. If a structure &ldquo;fails&rdquo; under a loading condition, it will not return to its original form after the loads are removed. The goal of the present invention is to design and control the mold to fail (break, rupture or bend past an elastic limit) and thus to avoid rupture, or even distortion, of the casting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Such collapsing molds typically consist of a thin layer of ceramic, which defines the casting cavity. This layer must be thin enough to fail due to the stresses induced (primarily compressive) by the metal next to it and partly adherent to it. Such a thin layer, however, would not be strong enough to be manipulated, handled or to enable transport of the mold before use, or to withstand the pressure and forces of the molten metal during pouring of the casting. Thus another aspect of the present invention is to design a support structure with a morphology that supports the thin wall that defines the casting geometry, yet that also fails as the casting solidifies and/or cools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> At least the following two failure mechanisms may be used in the design of the support structure. In one case, a support structure may be designed so that the difference in contraction of the casting relative to contraction of the ceramic mold induces bending in the structure, thereby causing the mold to fail. Alternatively, a support structure may be designed so that it fails under compressive loads, either by buckling of a support member or, more likely, by the breakage of the member under the compressive loading. The breakage of the support structure may also be due to a combination of bending and compression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Bending, compression, and buckling are three distinct and useful modes of breakage. There are also other useful modes. The present disclosure should not be taken to be limited only to bending, compression, and buckling. Other such useful modes include tensile failure and torsional failure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Inner Shell Design </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The thin inner shell defines the geometry of the casting. The thin shell must, thus, be impervious to the flow of liquid molding material. (This inner shell is porous to a degree. Molten metal does not penetrate it because it does not wet the ceramic.) Further, the thin inner shell must not restrain the casting as it cools. If the shell defines only the external boundary of a casting, such as with a simple shape, the casting may simply shrink away from the shell and the shell might not fail in such cases. However, for most geometries, some parts of the shell will be placed in compression by the casting. Further, the shell will often adhere in some places to the casting and will be pulled along with it at those points of adherance. Thus, in general, the shell must be designed to crush under compressive loading or buckle and collapse as the casting cools. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Design Considerations To Ensure That Inner Shell Fails During Cooling </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> It is instructive to first consider the case of the shell that is lightly adhered to the casting as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 1</cross-reference>A. For simplicity, a planar surface of the casting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, with the thin shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on it, will be examined. However, it should be understood that the shell need not be planar, and can be a curved surface. Further, it will be assumed that the ceramic shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, being thin, moves with the casting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. That is, as the casting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> contracts, the shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> contracts with it and the elastic strain in the shell is the difference between the shrinkage of the casting and the thermal shrinkage strain of the shell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In keeping with the analysis described Gibson and Ashby, <highlight><italic>Cellular Solids, </italic></highlight>Cambridge University Press, First paperback edition, p. 293 (1999) ISBN&num; 0-521-49911-9, one sees that the shell is under plane stress loading conditions and the stress developed in the shell can be found to be related to the strains in the casting and the shell as follows:

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The difference between the strain in the casting &egr;<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>and the strain in the shell &egr;<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight>is the relative strain &egr;<highlight><subscript>R</subscript></highlight>. This relative strain, &egr;<highlight><subscript>R</subscript></highlight>, is made up of two components: one due to the volume change upon solidification and the other due to the difference in contraction upon cooling. Taking a conservative value for this relative strain, based on only the difference in contraction upon cooling, a value on the order of 1% can be taken, as discussed in the background section above. Thus the numerator term in parenthesis in the equation above may be taken to be 0.01. The elastic modulus of porous materials may be estimated from the modulus of the bulk material and the volume fraction of material as described in <highlight><italic>Cellular Solids </italic></highlight>by Gibson and Ashby, above, p. 189. For alumina, with a volume fraction of 40%, the modulus is calculated as approximately 50 GPa. The Poisson ratio of the porous shell is difficult to estimate, but necessarily lies between 0 and 0.5. Thus, the stress in the shell under the conditions stated may be calculated as lying between 500 and 1000 MPa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Typically, the porous ceramics used to make molds have tensile breaking strengths of 5-20 MPa and compressive breaking strengths of 20-100 MPa. (Compressive strengths for ceramics are generally substantially higher than tensile strengths.) Thus, the ceramic shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will crush under compression long before the casting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has cooled to room temperature. This is the desired result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The above analysis examined the worst case of the shell being loaded in compression and found that it will still fail as the casting cools. In some cases, for example, where the shell remains only partially attached to the casting as it cools, the shell will be subjected to bending stresses and perhaps to tensile stresses. These stresses will be even more likely to cause failure of the shell than compressive stresses. Bending stresses are quite large and the ceramic shell is weaker in response to tensile stresses. Such partially attached shells may also fail in buckling rather than compression, as relatively long and thin members tend to buckle rather than crushing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Thus, if the shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that defines the geometery of the casting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be thin, the shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will fail after only a small temperature change of the casting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. One consideration that limits the thinness of the shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, is that it must be possible to fabricate it. For typical printing parameters in Three Dimensional Printing and other types of SFF, layer thicknesses of 100-200 microns are common. In such cases, shells of wall thickness ranging from 0.5-5 mm (5- 25 layers) are reasonable. The thinner shells would be applicable to smaller castings and thin walled castings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In order to guarantee the failure of the thin ceramic shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> during cooling of the casting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the shell is made to be thin. However, because it is thin, it cannot support substantial hydrostatic stress due to pouring the molten metal, unless some backup support <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is provided. This backup support <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be in the form of struts or a cellular structure, for example. In general, the structure may be characterized as foraminous, having skeletal elements, with voids therebetween. The skeleton and voids may be regular or irregular. The voids must be arranged to permit the removal of unbound material therefrom during manufacture of the mold. In 3D Printing, the unbound material is powder. In stereolithography, the unbound material is liquid. The voids can be empty, or filled with a weaker material, such as foam. If the voids are not empty, any material filling them should have a modulus of elasticity that is substantially less than that of the skeletal elements such that as the skeletal elements deform, very little load is taken up by any filler material. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> For example, for a one meter column of a steel alloy, as would be typical, (h&equals;1) the hydrostatic pressure may be found to be 75,000 Pascal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Taking a hydrostatic pressure of 75,000 Pa, and a thin shell <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of thickness t of 1 mm, one can calculate the extent of the shell, that will result in a maximum stress equal to 5 MPa (the lower range of breaking stress of the ceramic shell material). Using equation (2) it can be shown that w, the lateral extent of the shell, is equal to 15 mm. Thus, if the supports <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are spaced closer than 15 mm, the thin shell <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> will be able to withstand the loading due to the hydrostatic pressure. Equation (2) can be similarly used to calculate maximum support spacing for other thicknesses of shell <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, other shell material strengths and other hydrostatic loading conditions. Some safety factor might also typically be applied by assuming that the breaking strength is lower than the anticipated value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Further, it should be noted that the boundary conditions assumed for the segment of shell (fixed edges were assumed above) will change the value of the constant in equation (2) from the value given of 0.31. This analysis is presented as representative of the approach to be used in design of the shell. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> One must design the support struts <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> or other skeletal elements so that they do not themselves break or otherwise fail under the compressive loading due to hydrostatic pressure. The compressive strength of ceramics is typically much higher than the tensile strength, due to the sensitivity of tensile failure to small flaws that are frequently present in ceramics. For an estimate, the compressive strengths will be taken to be five times the tensile strengths. Thus, a ceramic that has a range of tensile strengths of 5-20 MPa, will have a range of compressive strengths of 25-100 MPa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In general, the breaking load a strut can take is given by the compressive strength of the material, times the cross sectional area A of the strut (which is equal to b<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The minimum value of the compressive strength expected in the ceramic has been used to predict the minimum value required of the ratio b/w to guarantee that strut failure does not occur prematurely, during pouring. For a ceramic with a minimum compressive strength of 25 MPa, and a pouring pressure of 75,000 Pa, this results in: b/w&tilde;0.05. As long as the ratio b/w exceeds this value, the struts <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in the support structure <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> will not fail in compression.

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Typically, the struts that might practically be fabricated will be fairly resistant to buckling and will break in compression before they break in buckling. For example, struts of ceramic, with modulus E&equals;50 GPa, which are 1 mm in cross section and 10 mm long, will not buckle at loads of less than approximately 1600 Newtons. Such columns fabricated of ceramic with compressive strengths of 125 MPa will break in compression at 125 Newtons. Thus, for most cases, columns that are strong enough to avoid breakage in compression, will also avoid breakage in buckling. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Design Considerations To Ensure That Support Structure Elements Fail During Cooling </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The foregoing discusses design considerations to ensure that the mold support structure does not fail prematurely, before the casting solidifies, due to stresses that arise during mold filling. The following discusses design considerations to ensure that the mold support does indeed fail as the casting cools, to prevent damage to the casting. There are several ways in which the support structures can fail, including, but not limited to, struts bending and struts crushing under compression. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Design Of Support Structure For Intentional Failure By Bending </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As shown with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the thin shell <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, which defines the outer geometry of the casting <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, can be supported by column-like skeletal support structures <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, which are also designed to fail due to stresses induced during cooling of the casting. It is useful to intentionally design these columns to purposely fail by one or both of two distinct mechanisms: bending or crushing. By designing the columns to fail by either or both of these mechanisms, before damage to the casting can take place, maximum protection is provided for the casting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In many geometries, the relative shrinkage of the casting and the shell will result in establishing shear strain within the shell. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows a planar surface of a casting <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the mold <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> immediately after pouring, before solidification of the casting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The mold is made up of the thin shell <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, which directly supports the poured metal <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The thin shell <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, is, in turn, supported by a support structure <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, made up here by spaced struts <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and spaced courses <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Together, a set of struts <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and a course <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> make up a story <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> much as the vertical wall studs and floor components constitute the skeleton for a story of a building. By &ldquo;course,&rdquo; it is meant all of the elements that constitute a foundation for a story of struts. As is discussed in more detail below, the support structure <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is three dimensional, and only a cross-section is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. There would also be struts <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> spaced along a dimension into and out of the plane of the figure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a rendering of a three-dimensional support structure, made up of linear struts <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> that are substantially perpendicular to the local plane of the shell <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, lattice members <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> that are substantially parallel to the local plane of the shell <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and sheets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The struts may extend along different angles, depending on the geometry of the casting rather than all being parallel, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. Further, the courses can be many different configurations, as shown <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, including solid sheets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, like finished floors in a building, open lattice elements <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, like floor joists before continuous floor surface is applied, or like bars in an open lattice, or any combination thereof. Further, the stories <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> are shown generally as planar in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. However, they need not be. For instance, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, they have curved portions, somewhat analogous to a layer of an onion. This is discussed in more detail below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows three stories <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, each composed of a course <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and struts <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The courses include both sheets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and lattice members <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In general, a story is a set of cells, like a story of a building is a set of rooms. The cells are defined by the struts <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and the courses <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>). The courses can be generally planar, or curved, and the struts can be arranged regularly or irregularly, as discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The fiducial marks C<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>b </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>are displayed herein only to establish reference locations within the metal casting, as it undergoes solidification, and cooling. They do not represent any physical structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows the same structure after solidification and, possibly, some cooling of the casting <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The mold <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is forced to move with the casting <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, either because of adhesion between the casting and the mold or because of a constraining geometric feature outside the boundary of the figure, that compresses the mold. The columns <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> are subject to bending due to the shear. This bending establishes tensile stresses on the convex side of the bend (indicated by a T) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>) and compressive stresses (indicated by a C) on the concave side of the bend. The thin shell <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is shown to have ruptured at R. The column <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, adjacent the fiducial C<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, is not shown to be bending, because it is taken as an ideal center toward which the surrounding structures are compressing. The columns <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are shown to be bending more than <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at fiducials C<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>, as this would likely be the case. One of the struts <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also shown to have broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In the design of such support columns, advantage is taken of the fact that ceramics can tolerate a substantially higher load in compression than in tension. Thus, the support columns <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> are loaded in compression when the mold is filled with liquid metal, and they do not fail. But as the casting solidifies, cools and shrinks, bending stresses arise in the columns <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and failure will take place at the tensile side of the columns. Specifically, the maximum tensile stress will occur at the base of the columns on the tensile side at location X (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Further, assuming that the strut deflects laterally an amount &dgr; as it bends under the constraint that the angle at the ends does not change (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</cross-reference>) an approximate level of maximum tensile stress in the struts can be determined as:

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The elastic modulus E of porous materials may be estimated from the modulus of the bulk. As noted above, for alumina, with a volume fraction of 40%, the modulus is calculated as approximately 50 GPa. For square struts of side 1 mm (b&equals;1 mm) and length 10 mm (L&equals;10 mm), for a material with a maximum tensile breaking strength&equals;25 MPa, one can calculate that the deflection &dgr; of the strut that will cause a fracture, is approximately 15 microns. In other words, if the strut is caused to displace laterally &dgr; by 15 microns or more by the shrinkage of the casting, the strut will break and will not thereafter exert a force on the casting that could distort or tear it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The magnitude of the deflection of the struts caused by the difference in contraction the casting relative to the shell can be estimated by examining a small planar circular area of diameter D as show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>. If it is assumed that there is no bending of the strut <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> at the center of the circle, one can calculate the shear displacement (and therefore deflection of the struts <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>) at the perimeter of the circle as:

<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The strut will fail, and the mold will fail, if the maximum stress that the strut material can withstand is less than the stress that it will experience. Using an example value of a planar region of diameter D&equals;5 mm and a relative strain &egr;<highlight><subscript>R </subscript></highlight>of 1%, one can see that the shear displacement at the perimeter of the circular region is 25 microns. This would be sufficient to break square cross-section perimeter struts <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> as specified above. Thus, even a small feature of the casting, i.e. on the order of 5 mm, has enough shear displacement to cause breakage of the struts in bending. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The calculations above show that a mold system can be designed that will fail for a wide range of mold geometries and geometric features, including small casting features. The methodology therefore can be quite insensitive to the precise nature of the cast part geometry. Further, it is not required that each and every support strut <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> break. If a substantial fraction along a path to relieve stresses on the mold break, the traction on the surface of the casting <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> will be relieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> For an extremely small feature, for typical ceramics e.g. in the range of 5 mm or smaller, the skeletal elements may simply bend elastically, but not fail. This bending will minimize any stress that might be placed on the casting, and avoid failure or distortion of the casting. Thus, the mold will serve its objective of preventing damage or distortion to the casting, even if it does not fail in the region of such small features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Thus, the designer will choose b and w such that the ratio of b/w exceeds the quantity determined by Eq. 6, above, to ensure that the mold will not fail during pouring. Simultaneously, the designer will choose h and L using Eqs. 9A, 10 and 11A to ensure that the mold fails during cooling by making sure that the strut experiences a stress that exceeds its maximum sustainable stress. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Fabricating a Cast Part </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Turning now to a discussion of fabricating a cast part according to one embodiment of the invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a mold <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, schematically. The rectangular cross-sectional dumbbell region <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, shown schematically inside the mold, is initially hollow. Eventually, the casting will form inside of it. An opening <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> in the top surface of the mold <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> communicates with the internal cavity <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. Molten casting material will be introduced to the cavity <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the part <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> that will be produced in the mold <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. It is a dumbbell, or dog-bone, with generally rectangular cross-sections. Such a part would have a high likelihood for hot tears, if cast with known technology. It lacks adequate fillets at corners; it has abrupt variations in thicknesses, and the bulbous ends would anchor the casting to the ceramic mold and prevent the metal part from contracting, as it would tend to do. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The mold <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> is shown schematically in cross-section in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, which is a cross-section of the mold of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> along lines X-X. The cavity <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> is substantially surrounded by a thin shell <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, such as is described above at <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It is designed to fail under compression that arises due to the shrinkage of the casting upon solidification, and to the differential in contraction during cooling of the casting and the shell <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The shell itself, is, in turn, surrounded by a support structure <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, which is shown schematically to be made up of struts <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> that, in part, define cells <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. The cells <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> are also defined, in part, by courses <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. A set of cells makes up a story <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. In some regions, such as adjacent the slender, inner part of the dumb-bell cavity, two stories <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> are provided, while in other regions, such as adjacent the ends, only one is provided. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is schematic only. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a digital image of an actual casting and mold which has approximately seven stories adjacent the center and five adjacent the ends.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the courses <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may be strut-like lattice elements, resulting in a fully open lattice type cell structure, as shown on the left hand side L of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the spaced courses <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be continuous sheets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, or a combination of sheets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and lattice elements <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows one story <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, with a sheet form course <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> on the bottom, and struts <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Another course <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, of the next story is shown on top. However, it should be kept in mind that each story <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> includes only one course. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that to some extent, in some configurations it may be arbitrary to distinguish between struts and courses. For instance, in the case of an open lattice structure, as shown on the left hand side L of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and a symmetric casting, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the struts and courses are essentially the same, with the only distinguishing feature being the location of the pouring hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>, the sheets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> are oriented generally horizontally, as shown. This should not be considered to be limiting in any sense. In any particular mold structure, the sheets may be oriented along any dimension (horizontally, vertically, in between, etc.) as the mold is used. Further, sheets in one portion of the mold may be oriented perpendicularly, or at any other angle, to sheets in a different portion of the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows straight, generally rectilinearly arranged struts <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and lattice elements <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> with the lattice elements <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> making up the courses, and flat, rectangularly bounded sheets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> as the courses. However, these structures need not be rectilinear. In the proper structure, the struts can be curved and inclined relative to each other. Further they can have any-cross section, and the cross-section may vary along their length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the sheets <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> need not be planar, but can also be curvaceous, as the needs of molding may require. They can also have varying thickness at different locations. One of the strengths of the various solid free form fabrication techniques in general, and Three Dimensional Printing, in particular, is that they can fabricate components of a wide variety, of almost any, shapes. Thus, the support structure surrounding the mold to make such parts must, and may also accommodate these shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the struts and courses to be located in a regular pattern, with equally spaced struts and courses. However, the struts and courses may be spaced unequally, or irregularly, as is required, to ensure that the mold fails before the casting is damaged. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Non Planar Casting Surfaces </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Up to this point, the methods for insuring that the castings do not tear or deform during solidification and cooling have been illustrated with surfaces that are planar, for clarity of presentation. The concepts, however, apply more generally to a casting of any shape, including any shape external surface and any shape internal geometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows, in 2-D cross-section (elevation view), a casting <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> with a non-planar, curved external geometry, which includes a concavity <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight>. The mold would again include a thin shell, which surrounds the part, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The support structure behind the shell might again consist of struts. However, in this case, the struts must in some manner accommodate the changes in angle of the surface. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a rectilinear truss system accommodating the part geometry of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In this case, the struts <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and courses <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> will, in general, not intersect the bounding shell <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> perpendicularly. The shrinkage of the casting <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and its effect on the struts <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and courses <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> will be a bit different than in the case of a planar surface where the struts and courses intersect the shell perpendicularly. (It is useful, at this point, to note, that for many purposes, including this one, the distinction between struts and courses is somewhat arbitrary.) In the case of non-perpendicular intersection, the shear displacement of the strut or course at its intersection with the shell will lead both to bending stresses and to compressive loads. Thus, the failure of such struts or courses will be due to a combination of these loading patterns. The methods described herein can be used to guarantee that either failure mode would be sufficient to guarantee failure of the strut or course. The advantage of this technique is that the design of the shell support system can be relatively easily automated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Alternatively as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the struts <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> can be arranged substantially perpendicular to the shell <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The courses, <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, are essentially parallel, or concentrically congruent with the shell. In such a case, the irregular geometry of the casting must be accommodated by some irregular arrangement (ie., a non-uniform pattern) of the struts, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. In such a case, the failure of the struts will be primarily due to stresses induced by bending. (Note that in both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, the plane of the cross-section does not cut through any portion of the pouring hole for introducing molding material to the cavity. Thus it is not shown.) </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Basic Use Of The Mold </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In general, when a layered manufacturing technique that uses powder is used, such as Three Dimensional Printing, as described in the patents identified above, the support structure <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) must be open to a degree that will permit the removal of the unbound powder. Typically, then, it is beneficial that there be a continuous open path from every cell to the outside of the support structure, to facilitate the removal of the loose powder. If liquid is used, such as stereo lithography would use, with ceramic powder, then paths for the removal of uncured liquid must be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows schematically a possible scenario for the reaction of the mold <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> to the stresses-that arise upon solidification and cooling. In general, large stresses may arise along the directions indicated by the arrows P. These will give rise to shear stresses, which might cause a section, such as <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, to separate from the remainder of the mold. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows schematically an end view, with dotted lines to show where the casting is, and showing where fracture lines in the support structure arise, generally around the part. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> shows similar fracture information, as viewed from the side. The fractures arise as the part shrinks away from the support structure, pulling with it, in some places, portions of the shell <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, which adhere thereto, and, in other places, crushing the support structure <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> that resides between the enlarged end portions of the dog-bone shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows schematically, by a digital image, a mold <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, that was used to make a part <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. A portion of the mold <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> has been removed. In fact, when a part was actually made, using a mold as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the stresses caused the mold to rupture somewhat violently, forcing large pieces of the mold to fly away from the casting. In this example, the cellular structure was of the open lattice type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> on the left hand side L. It can be seen that some of the stories <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> bowed upward, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and buckled, as they were squeezed and dragged under influence of the contracting dumb-bell shape. It can also be seen that at the end <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> of the casting, the casting separated from the support structure <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> that was adjacent to it. The thin shell is visible <highlight><bold>717</bold></highlight> above the thinner, bar section of the dumb-bell, having buckled upward. Another thin strip <highlight><bold>719</bold></highlight> of ceramic is also shown. This is a thin, spaghetti-shaped strip that had formed a piece of the shell in front of the casting, the top edge <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight>, of which, is just barely visible. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Design of support structure for failure by compression. </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The foregoing discussion has described molds and processes for making rather simple parts. A more complex part, such as a hollow casting, requires that the ceramic mold have a ceramic core to define the hollow space. Similarly, a casting with a concavity requires a core-like portion of the support structure. For instance, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows schematically a mold for making a casting <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> with a spherical internal hollow. The mold has an outer portion <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, and an inner core <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. The outer portion has a thin shell <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and a support structure <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, both, as described above. A hollow casting will form in the annular region <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Such a casting will have a hollow, spherical center. As a hollow casting cools, in general, the shrinking casting tends to put the ceramic core <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> in a combination of shear and compression. The relative contribution of shear and compression will depend on the geometry of the hollow space <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> and the core <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. For the example of an internal spherical space, as shown, the stresses will primarily load the core in compression and the struts will need to fail by crushing. In contrast, an internal space that is in the shape of a rectangular volume will create loading that is a combination of shear and compression. Depending on the relative contributions of shear and compression, the struts will either fail in bending or by crushing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Similarly, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, the portion <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) and <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) of the mold that is partially bounded by the casting <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> will be subjected to loading that is a combination of shear and compression. For cores that are configured such that a significant portion of the struts are placed under compression, rather than shear, it is important to design the ceramic support structure to fail due to compressive loading, as this may be the dominant loading mode. This may be accomplished by designing the support structure, such as struts or columns, to break either in compression or in a buckling mode or both. As noted above, in ranges of practical values of strut width and length, failure in compression will generally be encountered at stresses lower than those required to cause failure in buckling. Thus, in most cases, struts under compression will fail in pure compression, rather than buckling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the support structure struts can be and are designed so that they will not fail during pouring, even when their compressive strength is at the lower end of the expected range. Ensuring that the support struts withstand pouring defines a minimum value of the ratio b/w, generally, because the struts become weaker with smaller b, and there is more pressure per strut with larger w. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Given a maximum value of stress that the casting can tolerate during cooling (without suffering from a hot tear), one can also define a maximum value of the ratio b/w, to limit the stress imposed on the casting during the cooling. This ratio

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> from Eq. 6, and multiply that by a safety factor, and make and use the mold. If the mold proves too fragile, then the designer will increase b/w, by either increasing b or decreasing w, or both. If, on the other hand a hot tear or other casting deformation arises, then b/w should be decreased, by either decreasing b, or increasing w. Both sorts of adjustments can be done, either locally, near to the mold or casting failure, or overall, depending on the casting size, complexity, cost of mold fabrication, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> For example, if the maximum allowed stress on the casting is 10 MPa and the maximum compressive strength of the ceramic is 125 MPa, then the ratio b/w must not exceed 0.28. In the example cited above, in connection with Eq. 6, it was found that the minimum allowed value of the ratio b/w is 0.05. The actual ratio must therefore lie between 0.05 and 0.28. For a spacing w between struts of 15 mm (which is reasonable), the cross section dimension of the struts (b) must lie between 0.75 and 4.2 mm. This will guarantee that the core struts do not fail in compression or buckling during pouring, but do fail in compression before a surrounding casting can be damaged due to compressive loads imposed by the core (or shell) during cooling. In general, the maximum allowed ratio of b/w will be determined by experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The foregoing analysis indicates that for a wide variety of useful metal casting materials, and mold materials, a mold can be designed to fail before damage to the casting arises. Further, even for very small features, e.g. on the order of five mm, there is a large safety factor, making it possible to eliminate damage to the casting, virtually for certain. It should be noted that the skeletal elements can be different sizes and shapes as is required, in different regions of the mold. For instance, adjacent very small features, the skeletal elements can be thinner, for instance, thin struts. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Voids </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In some cases, it may be beneficial to provide some filler for the voids, but which filler will burn, or melt, or otherwise deteriorate away after the hot molding material is provided. For instance, certain fillers for the void may enhance the durability, or handleability of the mold. For instance, a foam filler may provide shock resistance to sharp, accidental impacts that the mold may experience in handling. Such spaces are still considered to be &ldquo;voids&rdquo;, as that word is used in the appended claims, whether or not the non-structural filler material completely deteriorates as the mold is filled with casting material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Support Structure Outer Shell </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> In many instances, it is beneficial to provide an outer shell to surround, in whole, or in part, the support structure. As shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> thin, outer shell <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> surrounds the support structure <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of the outer portion <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. The thin intermediate shell <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> defines the outer surface of the casting <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The inner surface of the casting <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is defined by the thin, innermost shell <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>, which itself surrounds a core support structure <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. The outermost shell <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is useful to facilitate handling and supporting the support structure either before it is fully processed (such as while it is still a green part) or even after full processing, in the many cases where an open lattice structure will be too fragile for handling. The outermost shell may be substantially complete, surrounding or enveloping the entire support structure, or it may be partial, existing at specific spots. Of course, there must be enough openings to remove unbound powder, or other mold material, such as liquid, in stereolithography. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Tub-like Mold </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The foregoing has illustrated embodiments of the invention with molds that generally enclose the casting in all directions, other than the port for filling casting material. However, the invention is also useful in connection with simpler, tub-like molds, that are generally open on one surface. For instance <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows such a tub-like version of a mold for casting a partial dumb-bell-shaped casting <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, that has a flat surface <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the positive z direction. A thin shell <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> defines the cavity, and is open in the positive z direction. Further, the shell <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> does not enclose the casting in the positive z direction. It is surrounded by a foraminous support structure <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>, as described above, made up of skeletal elements and voids therebetween. The support structure <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> surrounds the thin shell <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and the casting <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> in the positive and negative x and y directions, and the negative z direction, but not in the positive z direction. Thus, such a mold can be used for objects that have a complex geometry, accompanied by a planar surface, for instance, a flat base. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Stress or Strain </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The foregoing discussion has focussed on the stress that is applied to the various portions of the mold (shells and support structure) and their strengths in resistance to such stresses. Thus, it has generally been stated that the inner shell(s) that define the casting shape, must have enough strength to withstand the stresses of mold filling, but must not be so strong as to resist failure as the casting cools. The support structure has been characterized in the same way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> It is equally informative and correct to consider the phenomena at hand in terms of the failure strains of the materials involved, and the displacements of the structures. Thus, the shell and support structure must tolerate without failure the displacements that result from the hydrostatic loading of the molten metal during filling. Conversely, the shell and support structure must fail at displacements that are lower than those which the casting experiences as it solidifies and cools. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Heat Loss From Casting </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> An important aspect of creating a sound casting (that is, a casting with no voids) is proper control of the solidification of the casting. In some cases, it is necessary to be able to impose a directional solidification on the casting, to control the grain size and grain orientation. Such is the practice, for example, in casting turbine blades, either directionally solidified with columnar grain structure, or single crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The shell and support structure of the present invention can be applied in controlling the heat transfer from the casting. In regions where it is desirable to lose heat rapidly, the support structure can be left relatively open, to provide for pathways for radiative and convective heat transfer. The thin inner support shell also promotes rapid loss of heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In regions where it is desirable to reduce the heat flux from the casting, to slow the cooling, the support structure may be modified to provide a highly insulating structure. For example, rather than providing an open lattice strut system, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> on the left hand side L, the provided strut system may have planes of ceramic material, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> on the right hand side R, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. These planes will act both as radiation shields and also to reduce convective heat transfer, thereby providing a highly insulating structure to accommodate differential dimensional changes. Some regions can be open lattice, while other regions of the same mold can be in the planar form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As has been mentioned, it is also possible to fill the voids, either fully or partially, with a weak material, such as ceramic fiber, which will not prevent the support structure from failing. Such filling material can be placed at selected locations in the mold. It can act as additional thermal control, reducing both radiation and convection heat transfer, where desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Thus, the support structure may be locally tailored to provide the desired heat flow from the casting during cooling while simultaneously providing a disintegrating structure that protects the casting. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Mold Fabrication Steps </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The general nature of SFF techniques has been described above, and the more specific, yet still general nature of Three Dimensional Printing is set forth in the patents and applications listed at the beginning of this Detailed Description. Those principles may be applied to fabricate a mold of the present invention. Taking Three Dimensional Printing as illustrative, a computer representation of the three dimensional description of the mold, including inner shell(s), support structures, outer shell, voids, struts, courses, etc. is generated. From this, the part is built up by providing layers of powder, and sweeping across each layer with binder (according to any of the many methods mentioned in the patents listed), such that the struts and shells of the mold will bind. After the entire part has been built up, it is processed, to bond the bound parts. Then powder is removed. It may also be further processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> It is important for most embodiments of the invention that use powder particles to build up the support structure, to allow passageways from the areas that will eventually be voids, to outside of the support body. These passageways are necessary to allow the removal of the powder particles that will not be bound, so that the voids can be emptied and thereby form. In some cases, if the powder is not too tightly packed, unbound powder can be left in the voids, as it will not prevent collapse of the mold upon cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The orientation of the build up of layers may be any orientation. For instance, if the mold is generally rectilinear, with parallel stories of cells, then it may be built up such that the layers of powder provided are provided parallel to the planes of the stories. Alternatively, the entire part may be built up with the layers of powder provided obliquely relative to the planes of the stories. It does not matter that they are not parallel, because the binder can be applied to bind together powder particles that lie in a plane that is oblique to the plane of the layer of provided powder. The unbound powder supports the structure before the structure is removed from it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The mold is typically further processed to enhance its handleability, such as by heating, sintering, or even infiltration, as described in the patents and applications listed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Use of the mold has been described above, in general. The support structure and casting shell is supported on a fixture. Molten molding material is poured into the cavity such as through one or more access holes. The molten material is maintained such that it solidifies, with the possibility that the order and rate of solidification occurs in a controlled manner due to the customized arrangement of struts, sheets, cells and stories. The casting cools further, contracting as it does so, eventually resulting in the failure of the thin shells and support structure, in enough places such that even small features of the casting avoid hot tears or deformations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The invention can also be implemented with the other SFF techniques mentioned above, and the disclosure and the claims should not be considered to be limited to the powder or Three-Dimensional Printing embodiments discussed in detail or the stereolithography embodiments also discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The foregoing discussion should be understood as illustrative and should not be considered to be limiting in any sense. While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims. </paragraph>

These approaches result in materials which can be very difficult or impossible to pattern laterally and/or integrate. Other devices which can be prepared are macroscopic in scale, as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> By laterally patterning nanoscale arrays, a pathway to a rapid and reliable fabrication of three-dimensional nanostructures is provided. A simple method is described herein for the production of well-ordered, multilevel nanostructures. This is accomplished by patterning block copolymer templates with selective exposure to a radiation source. The resulting multi-scale lithographic template can be treated with post-fabrication steps to produce multilevel, three-dimensional, integrated nanoscale media, devices, and systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention provides a method of preparing a laterally patterned array. The method includes coating some of conducting or semiconducting substrate (for example, a metal, such as gold) with a block copolymer film (for example, a block copolymer of methylmethacrylate and styrene), where one component of the copolymer forms nanoscopic cylinders in a matrix of another component of the copolymer; placing a conducting layer on top of the copolymer to form a composite structure; vertically orienting the composite structure; removing some of the first component from some of the structure to form nanoscopic pores in that region of the second component; cross-linking the second component; and at least partially filling some of the nanoscopic pores with a material. The substrate can include conducting and non-conducting regions, which can be lithographically patterned. In such cases, a first component can be removed from some of the structure which is at least partially overlaying a conducting portion of the substrate. The structure can be vertically oriented by heating with an electric field, for example, for at least one hour. Some of the first component can be removed by exposing some of the structure to ultraviolet radiation, an electron beam, or ozone. Some of the first component can be removed by degrading the component and treating some of the structure with an agent that selectively removes the degraded component. Some of the nanoscopic pores can be filled by electrochemical deposition. Some of the nanoscopic pores and surface of the second component can be wetted with a surfactant prior to filling with material. Electrical current can be controlled to determine the amount of material deposited in the pores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention provides an array manufactured by the methods described herein. The array can include a substrate, a polymer film on the substrate, and at least one set of parallel metallic (for example, gold, copper or nickel) or semi-metallic cylinders in the film, and arranged perpendicular to the substrate. The cylinders can include a magnetic material, such as cobalt or nickel. The magnetic arrays can be used to make a magnetic storage medium, or a magnetoresistance device, or a giant magnetoresistive device. Non-magnetic metals can be used in such arrays to make, for example, a field emission device. In some embodiments of these arrays, at least one set of cylinders includes n-type material and at least another set of cylinders includes p-type material. Such an array can be used to create a thermoelectric cooler. The cylinders can also include alternating layers of magnetic and non-magnetic material, whether the layers alternate substantially regularly along the length of the cylinders or not. In such arrays, the sets of cylinders can be configured in substantially regular geometrical shapes, such as circles or triangles. Of course, irregular shapes can also find application in the devices disclosed herein. In some of the arrays, one type of cylinder has a given magnetization direction, and another type has an opposite magentization direction. In some embodiments, at least one set of cylinders is in electrical contact with another set of cylinders, for example, by a conductive contact on top of the film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;vertically-oriented,&rdquo; when referring to a copolymer film means a film that has cylindrical pores with the axis of the pores substantially normal to the surface with which the film is associated, or substantially normal to the film surface itself. The new materials can have cylindrical pores that are vertically oriented, or oriented at an angle to vertical, as long as the cylinders are oriented in substantially the same direction, e.g., in parallel. These cylinders can have various shapes and can, but need not, have a circular diameter cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;nanoscale&rdquo; refers to a characteristic size range, for example, of arrays, that is attained using the methods of self-assembly of copolymer molecules described herein. For example, the pore diameter, the wire diameter, the wire lengths and the period of the array can be in the nanoscale range, that is, within a range of about a nanometer to over a thousand nanometers. As used herein the term &ldquo;nanowire&rdquo; refers to nanoscale material created in an array pore. The term does not imply that the aspect ratio of the material need be high, and in some embodiments, the material to be deposited in an array can have a low aspect ratio. &ldquo;Nanowires&rdquo; can also refer to material that is not necessarily electrically conductive, but is nevertheless useful when present in nanoscale arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;multilevel&rdquo; refers to structures that can be constructed by multiple, independent levels of lithography, with at least one level created with a laterally-patterned diblock copolymer film. As used herein, the term &ldquo;multilayering&rdquo; refers to a structural element within a single layer of lithography that contains more than one material. As used herein, the term &ldquo;wire&rdquo; refers to conductive material having width and length, where the aspect ratio (that is the ratio of length to width) is at least 2:1. This term is distinguishable from the term &ldquo;dot,&rdquo; which refers to conductive material with lower aspect ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The techniques and systems described herein include many advantages. For example, the extremely high density of the magnetic cylinders in the new films offers the capability of using this system for next-generation magnetic data storage applications, with potential data storage densities in excess of 1000 Gbit/in2. The well-controlled size and separation distance of the magnetic metals on the metal, e.g., gold, film also offer the means to engineer next-generation giant-magnetoresistance magnetic-field-sensing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The processes are parallel, scaleable, and not subject to the speed limitations experienced in nanofabrication techniques based on serial writing. The techniques are amenable to manufacture, in that they are simple, fast, and cost-effective. They are readily adoptable by industry and compatible with other fabrication processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The techniques described herein significantly advance the general utility of nanofabrication by self-assembling copolymer templates. The nanofabrication techniques are amenable to manufacture, in that they are simple, fast, and cost-effective. They are readily adoptable by industry and compatible with other industrial microfabrication processes. For example, lateral patterning offers the capability of using such systems for the manufacture of electronic circuits on chips. The integration of nanostructures within chips and the interfacing of the structures with other chip elements in arbitrary locations is made possible through the methods disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For example, these three-dimensional structures offer the means to engineer electronic field-emission arrays. The arrays can be used in flat panel displays that are brighter, higher-resolution, less expensive, thinner, and more flexible than those currently available. Other field emission electron devices are possible, such as transistor-like devices, spin-polarized electron emitters, and other known devices based on field emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For example, the three-dimensional structures also offer the means to engineer solid-state thermoelectric cooling devices, including those with multistage cooling. Other applications include magnetoresistive sensors, high-capacity magnetic data storage, smart media, spintronics, chemical-sensing devices, biomolecular diagnostic sensor arrays, designer &ldquo;micromagnetic&rdquo; media, and molecular electronics, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Described herein is a process technology for the fabrication of three-dimensional devices using laterally-patterned block copolymer templates. In this method, copolymer films are patterned laterally by selective-area exposure to radiation sources. This produces a multi-scale lithographic template, that is, a regular array of nanoscale pores with an overall lateral extent confined to an arbitrary and desired design. The dimensions of the lateral design can range from the nanoscale to the microscale. The patterned array template is combined with appropriately tailored pre- and post-fabrication steps to produce multilevel, three-dimensional integrated nanoscale media, devices, and systems. The method introduces the ability to integrate nanoscale functional elements in arbitrary and desired locations on a chip and to integrate the functional elements with other chip components in a practical manner. The general utility of self-assembled copolymer templates is thereby significantly advanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> General Preparative Technique </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The methods described here are based on the formation of regular arrays of material on surfaces. For example, diblock copolymers, comprised of two chemically distinct polymers covalently linked end-to-end, can be self-assembled into well-ordered arrays of spheres, cylinders or lamellae, depending on the volume fraction of the components comprising the polymer chain. Directed self assembly, carried out with an external field (for example an electric or magnetic field, or a temperature or concentration gradient), can result in useful films, with orientation sufficiently long-ranged to allow the production of extended arrays of nanowires having aspect ratios of at least 2:1 or 3:1. Vertically-oriented, cylindrical phase diblock copolymer films are created. Among many suitable diblock copolymers that can be use, a {fraction (70/30)} (by volume fraction) polystyrene-polymethylmethacrylate diblock copolymer can be exemplified. Other cylinder constituents of the copolymer can be, for example, polybutadienes, polycaprolactones, and other materials that can be solubilized in solvents. Other matrix constituents can include polybutadienes and other materials which are not reactive with agents used to remove the cylinder constituents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A block copolymer is first deposited, e.g., spun-cast from solution onto a substrate, such as a metallic, semiconducting, or insulating substrate. The substrate can be rigid or flexible. Of particular interest are: substrates at least partially coated with a thin film of metal; semiconducting substrates; and semiconducting substrates at least partially coated with a lithographically-designed thin film metal electrode pattern. Suitable substrates include: silicon, such as silicon wafers or chips; and polymeric substrates, such as Kapon, each of which can be made conducting or semiconducting by coating at least a portion of the substrate surface with a conducting or semiconducting material. Among metal substrates, for particular applications, the oxidation of the metal should not be as rapid as the deposition rate of materials to be deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> For example, substrates for use in the devices and techniques described herein may be a coating or a non-continuous surface layer on an underlying material that need not be conducting. The amount of substrate used can be any amount that allows the substrate to function as an electrode, when electrodeposition is used to deposit functional material. If other methods of material deposition are employed, the nature and amount of substrate is not limited. The substrate, in embodiments in which it is present as a coating or surface layer, can be applied to an underlying substrate by conventional lithographic techniques, or other known methods of depositing conducting materials on surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the substrate can include metals, for example, gold. In other embodiments, the substrate can have gold coated or deposited on an underlying material. In some embodiments, the substrate can be a semi-metal oxide, including for example, silicon oxide. Particular preparation methods are not required, although in some embodiments, washing the substrate with water, followed by rinsing with mild acid and/or base can be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Diblock copolymers, comprised of two chemically distinct polymers covalently linked end-to-end, can be self-assembled into well-ordered arrays of spheres, cylinders or lamellae, depending on the volume fraction of the components comprising the polymer chain. If the volume fraction of a major component is about 0.7 (e.g., from about 0.65 to about 0.80), any copolymer will self-assemble into a hexagonal array of cylinders of the minor component embedded in a matrix of the major component. The mole ratio of the minor component of the diblock copolymer can range from about 0.20 to about 0.35 to permit the formation of microphases such as will result in cylinder formation. If the volume fraction of the major component is about 0.9, the minor component will form spheres, which can be elongated into very thin cylinders when an orienting field, e.g., an electric field, is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A mixture of diblock copolymers, such as A-B and A-C diblock copolymers, can be used to create cylinders of different types, for example B and C cylinders. Higher block copolymers, such as A-B-C triblock copolymers can also be used. The molecular weight of the copolymer can be varied to achieve differing cylinder diameters. For example, a molecular weight copolymer in the range of about 1.5 million molecular weight units (Daltons) can result in a cylinder diameter of about 70 nm. A molecular weight in the range of about 20,000 Daltons can result in a cylinder diameter of about 14 nm. A molecular weight of about 4 million Daltons results in cylinders with a diameter of about 100 nm, while a molecular weight of about 15 kilodaltons results in a diameter of about 1.0 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For some embodiments, the use of a block copolymer including a component that can be crosslinked is desirable. This component can be crosslinked before or during removal of another component, and can therefore add structural integrity to the copolymer. This component can be referred to as the matrix component. In some embodiments, the matrix component will be the major component of a copolymer, by volume. Suitable matrix components include polystyrene, polybutadiene, polydimethylsiloxane, and other polymers. The component that is to be removed can be called the core component. In some embodiments, the core component will be a minor component of a copolymer, by volume. Suitable core components include polymethylmethacrylate, polybutadiene, polycaprolactone or a photoresist. Generally, core components are materials that can be degraded or decomposed differentially than the matrix material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, block copolymers of styrene and methylmethacrylate can be used. In some embodiments, the methylmethacrylate block constitutes a minor component. For example, a {fraction (70/30)} (by volume) diblock copolymer of polystyrene/polymethylmethacrylate can be employed. Any block copolymers can be used, such as alkyl/alkyl, alkyl/aryl, aryl/aryl, hydrophilic/hydrophilic, hydrophilic/hydrophobic, hydrophobic/hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged/positively or negatively charged, uncharged/positively or negatively charged, or uncharged/uncharged. The film thickness can vary as desired, for example, from about 0.5 nm to about 10 cm, or from about 1 nm to about 1 cm, or from about 5 nm to about 1000 nm. In some preferred embodiments, film thicknesses can vary from between about 10 nm to about 200 microns, or from about 1 micron to 200 microns, or up to about 25 mil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Orientation of the copolymers can be carried out using directed self-assembly, that is, self-assembly which is directed by an external field, for example an electric field, a magnetic field, a thermal gradient or a concentration gradient. Vertical orientation of the cylinders can be accomplished by, for example, electric field alignment under annealing conditions, or, for example, self-orientation using controlled interfacial conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> For electric field-induced orientation, the different chemical constitutions of the blocks of the copolymer can result in a difference in the dielectric constants of the copolymer domains. A difference of about 0.1% in the dielectric constants can result in a specific, e.g., vertical, orientation. In an electric field, the orientation dependent polarization energy associated with the cylinders, dielectric bodies that are anisotropic in shape, will align the cylinders in parallel to the electric field lines, for example, as described in Morkved, et al., &ldquo;Local control of microdomain orientation in diblock copolymer thin films with electric fields,&rdquo; Science, 273, (1996), 931; Thurn-Albrecht, et al., &ldquo;Overcoming Interfacial Interactions with Electric Fields,&rdquo; Macromolecules, 33, (2000) 3250-53; Amundson, et al., &ldquo;Alignment of lamellar block-copolymer microstructure in an electric-field. 1. Alignment kinetics,&rdquo; Macromolecules 26, (1993), 2698; and Amundson, et al., &ldquo;Alignment of lamellar block-copolymer microstructure in an electric-field. 2. Mechanisms of alignment,&rdquo; Macromolecules 27, (1994), 6559. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Under strong enough fields parallel to the substrate, any surface induced alignment of the morphology can be overcome, producing cylindrical microdomains oriented in parallel with the fields, which can be normal to the substrate, that extend completely through a one-micron-thick sample. Scattering experiments are an easy means to characterize the orientation of the microphase structure in a thin film. When viewed from the side, a cylindrical structure oriented normal to the substrate is laterally periodic. Consequently, the scattering pattern measured at a finite incidence angle is strongly anisotropic, consisting of two equatorial Bragg peaks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments employing an electrical field to orient the polymer film, a removable conducting layer is placed on top of the copolymer film, sandwiching the film between two electrodes. For example, a conducting layer can be deposited by spin coating and then, after annealing, be removed by etching, e.g., by solvent chemical, or physical etching. Alternatively, a &ldquo;spin-on&rdquo; sacrificial layer can be applied, followed by a metal layer that is evaporated, sputtered, or spun-on. After annealing, the sacrificial layer can be removed by solvent, chemical, or physical etching. This conducting layer can be metal, or semiconducting material, and can optionally be in contact with the entire film surface. For example, aluminum, copper, gold or other metal can be used as the conducting layer on the copolymer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Metallized layers, such as aluminized KAPTON&reg; can also be used. Metallized layers can promote the formation of a uniform film surface as orientation, e.g., vertical orientation, is carried out. For example, in some embodiments, the use of a metal conducting layer alone, in direct contact with the copolymer film, can result in damage to the copolymer layer as the conducting layer is removed, due to sticking and/or tearing. Aluminized Kapton&reg; is a layer of aluminum in register with a layer of Kapton&reg;, in which the Kapton&reg; layer is directly in contact with the copolymer film. The Kapton&reg; layer must not be so thick as to interfere with an electric field established between the aluminum layer and the substrate on the other side of the film. Other metals and other polymeric materials can be used to create metallized layers for electric field-induced vertical orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> To mobilize the molecules in the copolymer, the sandwich structure can be heated above the glass transition temperature of the copolymer. Voltage is then applied between the substrate and the conducting layer to create an electric field through the mobilized copolymer film. The electric field strengths are at least 5 V/mm, for example, at least 10 V/mm. After holding the film in this state for a sufficient time to allow the copolymers to self-assemble, for example, over 30 minutes, over 60 minutes, over 1.5, over 2, or over 3 hours, the copolymer film assembly is cooled to a temperature below the glass transition temperature of the copolymer. The orienting field, e.g., electric field, is desirably turned off after the cooling has taken place. At this point the conducting layer, and any associated additional layer, is removed from the polymer film. The film now includes an ordered array of cylinders of one copolymer component embedded in a matrix of another copolymer component. Self-assembly results in parallel orientation of the blocks, such that one component forms cylinders with the cylinder axis substantially in parallel to each other, e.g., all normal to the surface of the substrate, or substantially normal to the film surface itself. The cylinders desirably extend substantially from the substrate surface to the surface of the film. The cylinders have diameters ranging from about 5 nm to about 100 nm. The periodicity (L) of the cylindrical domains in the film is the distance between the central axes of the cylinders, and is proportional to the molecular weight of the copolymer (to the &frac23; power). In embodiments in which the mole fraction of the minor component is from 0.2 to 0.35, and the cylinders are hexagonally packed, the periodicity defines the diameter of the cylinders. Periodicity can range, for example, from about 1.0 to about 70 nm, but can be outside this range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, methods other than heating are used to make the molecules of the copolymer mobile. For example, rather than heating the copolymer to its glass transition temperature, one can, in effect, lower the glass transition temperature, by any of a number of ways. For example, one can add a plasticizer, a solvent, or a supercritical fluid, such as supercritical CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, to the copolymer to mobilize the molecules and allow them to move and self-assemble. An orienting field is applied, and the plasticizer, solvent, or supercritical fluid is removed to immobilize the molecules. Thereafter, the orienting field is removed, but the immobilized molecules maintain their orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Orientation using electric field allows a wide range of film thicknesses to be prepared, and thereby a wide range of nanowire aspect ratios to be produced. Nanowire aspect ratios can range, for example, from about 0.05:1 to about 10,000:1; or about 0.1:1 to about 5,000:1; or about 1:1 to about 500:1; or about 2:1 to about 10,000:1 or about 2:1 to about 5,000:1, or about 2:1 to about 500:1, or about 2:1 to about 100:1. Such large aspect ratio wires in an extended array are useful for creating sufficiently large magnetic coercivity though shape anisotropy, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Orientation using controlled interfacial interaction is well suited for relatively thin diblock films. For example, less than about 100 nm, or less than about 60 nm, or less than about 40 nm thick. According to such methods, a substrate is pre-treated so that it presents a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; surface to a copolymer diblock film. Hydrogen-passivated silicon, or silicon coated with a random-copolymer brush, are suitable exemplary neutral surfaces. Thin diblock films can be spun-cast atop this surface and annealed. The cylinders will self-orient vertically without directed self assembly from an external field in sufficiently thin diblock films, for example, films of less than about 100 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Such methods result in a very flat film surface and simplify manufacture, since the application and subsequent removal of a top electrode are not strictly required. Ultra-high density magnetic data storage can be achieved if magnetic materials having larger intrinsic anisotropies than cobalt are used. (FePt for example.) High pattern resolution on thin films is possible using an electron beam for lateral patterning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The surface of the copolymer film obtained after orientation can be used as formed for a number of applications. For some applications, the surface of the vertically oriented copolymer film is desirably substantially smooth. Such arrays and techniques for producing substantially flat surfaces are described in United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/191,340, filed Mar. 22, 2000, titled &ldquo;Magnetic Arrays;&rdquo; and United States patent application Ser. No. 09/814,891, filed Mar. 22, 2001, titled &ldquo;Nanocylinder Arrays,&rdquo; and each application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, for magnetic data storage applications, in which a reading device passes rapidly over a magnetic array, the surface is desirably smooth. Any application in which a read or write head passes over an array can require high smoothness. Smoothness of a magnetic array for data storage and retrieval applications desirably ranges from about 0.5 to about 5.0 nm. The surfaces of vertically oriented copolymer films can be made smooth with the use of an additional material, such as an elastomer or a crosslinked elastomer applied to the conducting layer before vertical orientation steps are undertaken. For example, an additional material, such as a crosslinked silicone, including crosslinked-polydialkylsiloxanes, -polydiarylsiloxanes, or -polyalkyl-arylsiloxanes, including, for example, crosslinked-polydimethylsiloxane, can be applied to a conducting layer, or in some embodiments, to an additional layer, as described above. The conducting layer, and/or any associated additional layer, is coated with the additional elastomeric material, and the layers placed in contact with the copolymer film. Vertical orientation is carried out, as described above, and the layers removed from the surface of the vertically oriented copolymer film. The surface can be made thereby smoother than surfaces created without the additional elastomeric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Next, the minor component (or in some embodiments the major component) of the substrate-associated copolymer is removed (either component of a diblock copolymer can be &ldquo;minor&rdquo; or &ldquo;major,&rdquo; and the components can also be equally present). Removal of the minor component is achieved, e.g., by exposure to radiation (ultraviolet light, x-ray radiation, gamma radiation, visible light, heat, or an electron beam or any other radiation source which selectively degrades the minor component). Degradation or decomposing agents such as reactive oxygen species, including for example, ozone, or solvents such as ethanol, can also be used. Ultraviolet light can be used to degrade, for example, polymethylmethacrylate as a core component. Ethanol can be used to degrade, for example, polybutadiene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> This treatment can be followed by a chemical rinse to remove the decomposition byproduct, and typically results in porous material having pore sizes in the tens of nanometer range. A step to remove any residual component can include treatment with a liquid, including washing with a solvent, or a material that reacts preferentially with the residual component, such as an acid or a base. In some embodiments, the material used to react with residual degraded component can be, for example, a dilute form of acetic acid. The volume formerly filled by a now removed copolymer component now comprises cylindrical spaces extending through the thickness of the film. The remaining volume is occupied by the remainder copolymer component and is referred to as the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, it may be desirable to optionally cross-link a component of the copolymer film. Cross-linking of a component that is not degraded by an energy source or agent can add structural strength to the film. In some embodiments, a copolymer component is crosslinked simultaneously with the degradation of another copolymer component. The radiation can optionally and desirably crosslink and substantially immobilize the matrix component of the diblock copolymer, so that the matrix maintains the array structure even after the cylindrical voids are created. A nanoporous array template is the resulting overall structure. For example, in the case of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cylinders in a polystyrene (PS) matrix, ultraviolet radiation degrades the PMMA while crosslinking the PS. It is desirable that the initial morphology of the copolymer be retained throughout the entire process of degradation. Other methods of removing one or the other component (e.g., chemical methods) can be used. Either the &ldquo;minor&rdquo; or &ldquo;major&rdquo; component can be removed or be remaining. The dimensions of the pores generally are the same as those of the cylindrical domains of the vertically oriented copolymer film, and as such, the pore diameters can range from about 5 nm to about 100 nm or more, and the periodicity can range from about 5.0 to 70 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the resulting pores are at least partially filled with, for example, metallic, metalloid, semiconductor, and/or magnetic materials. Deposition of functional material can be carried out by, for example, electrodeposition, chemical vapor deposition, electroless deposition, surface chemistry, chemical adsorption, and chemically driven layer-by-layer deposition. For deposition of material in pores that have depths of more than about 30 nm, electrodeposition is a desirable method, since it provides a driving force for the deposition of material into the bottoms of the pores. For example electrodeposition within the pores of a nanoscale template derived from films of diblock copolymers provides a convenient means of filling the large aspect-ratio pores in a highly controlled manner to provide an array of nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> For those applications relying on magnetic properties of the array, the nanowires include at least some magnetic material. Magnetic materials include cobalt, nickel, iron, and alloys which contain one or more of these materials, and includes those materials which are measurably magnetic. For those applications relying on magnetic properties of the array, the nanowires include at least some magnetic material. Magnetic materials are those materials that are measurably magnetic, and can include magnetic metals, such as cobalt, nickel, iron, rare-earth magnetic materials, and alloys that contain one or more of these materials (such as iron-platinum alloys, or PERMALLOY&reg;, an alloy of iron and nickel, with a stoichiometry of Ni<highlight><subscript>81</subscript></highlight>Fe<highlight><subscript>19</subscript></highlight>), as well as magnetic non-metals, including ceramic materials such as strontium or barium in combination with iron oxide. Organic magnets, such as tetracyanoethylene, can also be employed as magnetic materials. Magnetic systems can also contain materials that are non-magnetic, including non-magnetic metals, such as copper, gold, silver, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Magnetic materials can also be prepared as magnetic nanowires by deposition of alternating layers of magnetic metals and non-magnetic materials. Such alternating layers can be optionally and, for some embodiments desirably, regularly alternating, and the regularity can include regularly alternating amounts of such materials. For example, a magnetic nanowire can include at least three layers of material alternating as: magnetic metal, non-magnetic material, magnetic metal; or non-magnetic material, magnetic metal, non-magnetic material. The alternating layers can be optionally, and in some embodiments desirably, non-regularly alternating. More details are given in &ldquo;Magnetic Multilayers and Giant Magnetoresistance: Fundamentals and Industrial Applications (Springer Series in Surface Sciences, No 37),&rdquo; Uwe Hartmann (editor), 370 pages, (Springer-Verlag, 2000), which is incorporated herein by reference. Cobalt/copper alternating multilayers have been found to be useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Magnetic materials can be generally chosen to have a selected magnetic coercivity, which will depend on the desired application. For example, by using just cobalt (Co) nanowires, the coercivity can range from about 7000 Oe, to any lower number. Under appropriate fabrication conditions, the perpendicular coercivity of a cobalt nanowire array can exceed 1.7 kOe at 300K, due to the cylindrical shape anisotropy and nanowires having diameters smaller than the size of a single magnetic domain. The coercivity can be tuned to smaller values by selecting specific electrodeposition conditions, pore diameter, and additives. For example, using the techniques described herein (applied field perpendicular to the substrate and parallel to wire axis), one can establish perpendicular coercivity of about 800 Oe at room temperature. Higher coercivities can be obtained by depositing rare earth magnetic materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Magnetic materials can also have their magnetoresistive behavior tuned by adjusting the thickness of the magnetic sections, the thickness of the normal metal sections, and the diameter of the multilayered nanowires. These devices are so-called &ldquo;giant&rdquo; magnetoresistive devices, which are sensitive magnetic field sensors, in that the resistance changes dramatically with a change in magnetic field. One can also intentionally make &ldquo;two-state&rdquo; devices using non-regular multilayering. For example, a thick magnetic layer, followed by a thin normal metal layer, and then followed by a thin magnetic layer can be deposited in nanowires to form an array useful to design a two-state device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, one can reverse the magnetization state of the smaller magnetic layer by increasing the current through the device. A spin-polarized electron current leaves the larger magnetic region and is injected into the smaller magnet. This current exerts a torque on the magnetization in the smaller magnet and can reverse the direction of magnetization. The change in magnetization is typically accompanied by a discrete change in measured resistance. This results in a way to &ldquo;write and read&rdquo; using current. One can &ldquo;write&rdquo; with a larger current, and &ldquo;read&rdquo; with a smaller current. These concepts are discussed in Katine et al., &ldquo;Current-driven magnetization reversal and spin-wave excitations in Co/Cu/Co pillars,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. Lett., </italic></highlight>84, (2000), 3149. Optimal electrodeposition of magnetic material can involve the alignment of the magnetic axis of the material normal to the surface upon which the magnetic material is deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> For those applications which do not rely on magnetic properties of arrays, any other material which can be electrodeposited can be employed, including metals generally, semimetals (including, for example, Bi and BiTe), and certain semiconducting materials that can be electrodeposited. Optimal electrodeposition of magnetic material can involve the alignment of the magnetic axis of the material substantially, parallel or skew normal to the surface upon which the magnetic material is deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The technique described above is generally depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which shows an oriented diblock copolymer film on a substrate. The dark areas on the substrate represent one of the components of the diblock copolymer, and the adjacent lighter areas represent the other component of the diblock copolymer. The upper surface of the copolymer film is here shown perfectly flat. This condition can be preferable for some applications, although this is not a requirement for the technique generally. Those applications which desirably involve the production of substantially flat film surfaces can utilize methods which use a further polymer on top of the copolymer film. For example, polydimethylsiloxane can be deposited across the surface of the copolymer film to produce a substantially flat surface on the copolymer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> For particular applications, the matrix material is desirably removed from the substrate surface after deposition of functional material. In other applications, the matrix material is desirably present subsequent to deposition to provide structural stability to the array of nanowires, or to allow further post-fabrication lithographic steps. Removal of matrix material can be achieved by treating the array with an agent that selectively degrades the matrix material with respect to the nanowires as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Selective Exposure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The methods of certain embodiments described herein are based on the selective exposure of the diblock copolymer template to a radiation source which removes material from the polymer film, to create three-dimensional nanoscale elements in a multilevel integrative technology. Special multilevel processing steps, specifically tailored to each particular device configuration, are used to achieve the complex integration. A simple product may require patterned diblock level of lithography only, while a complex integrated product may also require pre- and post-fabrication lithographic steps. The common technique to all cases of nanostructure fabrication is the selective copolymer patterning technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The process involves the selective alteration of specific areas or location of a nanoporous copolymer template, e.g., by exposure to a radiation source. Suitable radiation sources for the selective degradation of a copolymer component include, for example, ultraviolet (UV) light, electron beams, or other sources of radiation that can efficiently degrade a component of a diblock copolymer. The process is depicted generally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which shows a side view of a vertically oriented diblock copolymer film on a surface, with radiation impinging on the copolymer film. The radiation removes material from the film to create cylinders, and since the exposure is selective, there are areas of the film that contain cylinders, and areas which do not. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is an overhead view of the same film, showing explicitly that, in this case, a triangular shape has been imposed on the film surface, resulting in an area where electrodeposition can potentially be carried out, depending on the characteristics of the underlying surface. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts the same process and resulting template, with the matrix component of the film deleted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> For applications involving the use of UV light, a UV mask or UV projection can be used for spatial selectivity across the surface of the array. For applications involving electron beams, a focused electron beam writer or other electron beam source can be used for spatial selectivity. The exposure pattern imposed on the surface can be related to, or dictated by, underlying features in the film or on an underlying surface, or can be unrelated to such features. For example, when the underlying surface includes an electrode pattern, specific alignment of portions of the diblock exposure pattern with portions of the electrode pattern can be a requirement for device manufacture. The resulting array is referred to as being laterally patterned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Once a patterned nanoporous array template is created, surface-selective materials deposition methods can be used to locate desired materials into the pores to create nanoscale elements. Nanowires will be present only in areas which are the union of areas exposed to radiation, and areas containing an electrode underlying the surface of the copolymer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Novel use of electrochemical deposition methods, for example, enables several applications. Other surface-selective materials deposition techniques can be used, including chemical vapor deposition, electroless deposition, surface chemistry, chemical adsorption, and chemically driven layer-by-layer deposition, for example. In the case of electrochemical deposition, different electrodes can be held at differing voltages during the electrochemical deposition to allow or prevent deposition at chosen electrodes, and this technique can be referred to as &ldquo;programmed deposition.&rdquo; Specifically, since the underlying electrodes are separately addressable, one electrode (or group of electrodes) can be held at a potential appropriate for deposition of one material, while other electrodes are held at potentials which do not allow depositions of that material. This method offers expanded materials versatility, in that different types of nanowires can be deposited on the same chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> An example of this type of nanofabrication is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which is a schematic diagram of a multilevel structure created using the concepts described above. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the matrix component of the copolymer is deleted from view for clarity. The substrate includes thin film electrodes in, or on, its surface, which can be created by conventional lithography, for example. Lateral patterning can be carried out in registry with the underlying electrode pattern as desired, followed by electrodeposition of a first material, results in the creation of first nanowires, as shown. Subsequent electrodeposition of a second material, at an electrode potential different from that used for the electrodeposition of the first material results in the creation of second nanowires, as shown. First and second materials can differ in characteristics, particularly in characteristics which are relevant to the functional aspects of the devices. The first and second materials can be metals or semi-metals, so that characteristics, such as reduction potential, semi-metal type (for example, &ldquo;n&rdquo;- or &ldquo;p&rdquo;-type semi-metal, metalloid or semiconducting materials), reduction potential, and other useful characteristics can be varied in different locations of the film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, lateral patterning, followed by electrodeposition of a first material creates first nanowires as shown. Another lateral patterning step, in a different location, followed by electrodeposition of a second material, at any electrode potential, results in the creation of second nanowires. Subsequent lithography, also known as electrodeposited post-level connections, on the surface of the film creates connections between sets of nanowires, and allows the creation of simple or complex circuits. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an overhead view of another example of such a three dimensional structure, emphasizing the relationship between electrical connections underlying (level &num;1), through (level &num;2), and overlying (level &num;3) the matrix component of the diblock copolymer to create electrical connections in registry with components on these differing levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In some applications, it is desirable to use subsequent upper levels of lithography for interconnection and integration purposes. Such embodiments are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which show two basic configurations of magneto-electronic transport nanodevices. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>depict magneto-electronic device configurations that utilize transport current through the nanowires. These devices utilize anisotropic magnetoresistance, giant magnetoresistance, or spin-polarized current switching magnetoresistance, as discussed in Katine et al., &ldquo;Current-driven magnetization reversal and spin-wave excitations in Co/Cu/Co pillars,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. Lett., </italic></highlight>84, (2000), 3149, for magnetic sensing and &ldquo;spintronic&rdquo; purposes. They are relevant to magnetic data storage read head technology, magnetic RAM, and magnetic sensing applications. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows a first configuration, in which the &ldquo;current in&rdquo; and &ldquo;current out&rdquo; electrodes are on the substrate level, and the interconnection between these two electrodes is on the upper interconnect level. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows a second configuration, in which the &ldquo;current in&rdquo; electrode is on the substrate level and the &ldquo;current out&rdquo; electrode is on the upper interconnect level. Particular combinations of these configurations will be readily apparent to those designing circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A device of the construction depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> has been made, and a microscope photograph of this device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The patterned black regions are the locations of the nanowires. Magnetoresistance measurements of electron transport through the device depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> have been carried out, and are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In addition, the nanowires themselves can be multilayered, using pulsed electrodeposition in a two-component bath, for example, to create Cu/Co multilayers, or by sequential electrodeposition. Some embodiments of multilayered nanowires are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Magnetic nanowires are, as discussed above, created using magnetic materials, principally including cobalt, nickel, iron, and alloys containing these metals, and are useful for anisotropic magnetoresistance applications. Multilayered magnetic nanowires are created using substantially regularly alternating layers of magnetic materials and non-magnetic materials within individual nanowires (for example, Co/Cu alternating layers), and are useful for giant magnetoresistance applications. Asmmetric magnetic heterostructures are made using substantially nonregularly alternating layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials, useful for spin-polarized current switching magnetoresistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Immediately after the selective area exposure, the polymer film contains polymer in three distinct states: 1) the degradation by-products; 2) the insoluble component; and 3) the virgin, oriented diblock copolymer in the unexposed regions. The coexistence of these three states offers additional fabrication versatility. By choice of solvent or radiation, one can choose to remove only the exposed cylinders, or alternatively, the exposed cylinders and the unexposed regions of diblock copolymer. For example, acetic acid can be used to remove degraded polymer fragments from the exposed area, but will not affect the matrix component. An agent such as acetic acid will also not remove material from the virgin, unexposed diblock copolymer. If desired, the removal of material from virgin regions can be achieved by treatment with another agent, for example, toluene. If desired, the removal of the unexposed diblock copolymer can be chosen to occur at a separate stage of processing, for example, after nanowires have been fabricated in the pores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> It is also relevant to note that for high-dosage over-exposures, both polymer blocks will crosslink, rendering a solid insoluble film that can also be used for fabrication purposes. In such embodiments, neither component of the diblock copolymer can be removed. Such areas can be used as robust barriers, which protect the underlying substrate from further solvent processing. The use of different combinations of exposure and solvent protocols greatly advance the general utility of the general procedures described herein for the fabrication of nanostructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In data storage applications, patterning of magnetic arrays can be used to create patterned perpendicular magnetic media, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Each set of nanowires is separated from other sets of nanowires by unexposed diblock copolymer. All individual nanowires within a given set of nanowires have the same magnetization direction, either up or down, corresponding to a data bit of either &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;0.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In other applications in which the magnetic switching behavior of magnetic arrays can be exploited, the laterally patterned arrays described herein are of utility. The magnetization switching field of a magnetic nanowire can be modified substantially by the magnetic dipolar interactions it experiences due to neighboring nanowires, and consequently depends on whether the nanowire is found in a circle, triangle, cross- or star-shape, or other shape which tends to maximize or minimize the exposure of nanowires to each other or nonmagnetic areas of the film. The lateral extent and shape of an array of magnetic nanowires will influence its switching behavior dramatically. This can be observed in the magnetic hysteresis curve (magnetization versus applied field) and in the magnetoresistance of a device using such wires. Using the patterned diblock templates we can create &ldquo;designer micromagnetic media.&rdquo; This designer media can be used in magneto-transport device technologies that require discontinuous changes at specific threshold fields or for other applications that utilize step-wise changes in magnetic field. Some of such embodiments are exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which show both triangular and circular sets of nanowires. The discontinuous switching behavior of designed devices can be enhanced for particular applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The three dimensional nanostructured arrays described herein can be used in of technologies, including: display technology, cooling technology, magneto-electronic technology, data storage technology, sensor technology, biomolecular array technology, molecular electronic technology, waveguide technology, and other technologies. The techniques presented here are general and provide advances to a variety of research materials systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Field Emission Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Field emission displays (FEDs) offer high brightness, low power consumption, and flat-panel design. The displays can include an addressable array of field emitters and a phosphorescent screen. Efficient field emission displays require high-aspect-ratio nanoscale metal tips (for example, from about 20:1, or about 35:1, or about 50:1 to about 10,000:1) to enable electronic field emission at low threshold voltages. To achieve a sufficiently large current density, the emitters are desirably arranged into a high-density array. To define display pixels, the array is desirably patterned laterally into sets of nanowires, with each pixel electronically addressable. These sets can include from one to 10, 20, 30, or more nanowires, depending on the desired application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The present invention offers simplified processing and the ability to make tip arrays with improved orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The ultra-high density, laterally patterned arrays created by the methods described herein can be successfully used for high-resolution, low power, thin and flexible display devices. The high aspect ratio of nanowires created by the techniques described herein allow the threshold voltage for emission to be sufficiently low so that power consumption for such field emission devices is correspondingly lowered. The devices are useful for television and video screens, computer monitor screen, and many other display devices such as on watches, GPS devices, and any other devices currently using LED or LCD displays. The thinness of such field emission arrays allows the design of such devices to be far thinner than devices available currently. Display devices made with the technology described herein are also much brighter for a given level of energy consumption than those currently available. The possibility of using a flexible substrate further expands the utility of display devices made with the techniques described herein. Differing display applications will have differing priorities as regards operating characteristics; for example, an outdoor display can require high brightness, and a video display can require high resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> An example of a field emission array created according to the methods described herein is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which is a perspective view of a diagram of such an array. The substrate has electrodes in or on its surface, created by conventional lithography. Diblock copolymer is deposited on the substrate, as described above, for example, by spin-bonding. Vertical orientation, selective irradiation, chemical treatment, and electrodeposition follow to create sets of nanowires, in this case, deposited on two distinct electrodes. For field emission applications, the ends of the nanowires are desirably at or near the film surface. This can be achieved by either growing (that is, electrodepositing) the wires to substantially the full film thickness, or by growing them to a lesser extent (for example, 90% of the film thickness), followed by removal of a portion of the surface of the film, by means known to those of skill in the art (including, for example, reactive ion etching by oxygen plasma). Again, the matrix component is deleted from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> for clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A device according to the construction of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> was made, and microscope photographs of this device are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The diblock template is shown patterned into a circular region at 20&times; magnification in the upper left of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The same region is shown after 250 nm cobalt nanowires have been grown at &minus;1V into the circular region, but before electrical measurements were made at 20&times; magnification in the upper right of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The same region is shown after electrical measurements were made and then having brought up the emission current to the point at which the sample was destroyed in the lower part of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> (lower left at 5&times; magnification, lower right at 20&times;magnification). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> shows a graph of electronic field emission measurements made from the array shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. A large current density and a low threshold was achieved. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a close up of the images from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, upper right and lower left, before and after destroying the sample, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The electrodes are individually addressable, in this case, with voltages V<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. These applied voltages are independently varied as desired to control (that is, turn &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo;) the emission current from each nanowire set. A phosphor screen can be placed above the nanowire sets to create a display. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an overhead view of a similar device, but with four individually addressable sets of nanowires. It is important to note that nanowires are deposited only on the substrate where: 1) the copolymer is exposed to irradiation that degrades a component of the copolymer down to the substrate surface; 2) the residue of degraded component is removed from the substrate surface; and 3) the substrate surface has an electrical contact allowing electrodeposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Thermoelectric Cooling Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Solid-state cooling devices can also be designed utilizing the technology described herein. At present, the best commercially available thermoelectric cooling devices have thermoelectric figures of merit of approximately 0.1. The techniques described herein can produce devices which have thermoelectric figures of merit approaching or exceeding 2.0, e.g., devices having a figure of unit of 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 1.11, 2.0 or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a diagram of a single-stage thermoelectric cooler which can be made according to the methods described herein. The substrate has electrodes pre-patterned in or on its surface. A patterned diblock copolymer layer is created on the substrate, as described herein. Again, the matrix component of the copolymer is deleted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> for clarity. Nanowires of two types are deposited by programmed electrodeposition. In the depicted example, &ldquo;n-type&rdquo; nanowires, made from &ldquo;n-type&rdquo; materials, well known in the art, are deposited at one electrode, and &ldquo;p-type&rdquo; nanowires, made from &ldquo;p-type&rdquo; materials, also well known in the art, are deposited at another electrode. A top-layer metal interconnect is then deposited electrochemically. The device operates through the application of current through the device, so that the top plate becomes cold and the electrodes and substrate become warm. The top plate can be used as a heat sink for use in electronic devices, for example. Multistage coolers can also be made by this fabrication method. Heating devices are also made possible by the simple adaptation of the device for such purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Magnetic Data Storage Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Next generation magnetic data storage technologies will likely utilize perpendicular magnetic media to store data. Present technologies use lateral magnetic media in which the magnetic storage elements lie along the surface of the substrate. In the effort of packing more elements per unit area, the size of the basic elements must be reduced. This introduces a problem, however, since as the scale of these regions is reduced, so is the blocking temperature which marks the onset of superparamagnetism. The blocking temperature must be kept large, otherwise the stored magnetization state of each element will decay and data will be lost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> One way to reduce the size scale of a magnetic media element without substantially reducing the blocking temperature is to utilize shape and volume, that is, to make small cylindrically-shaped objects of high aspect ratio (for example, from about 20:1, or about 35:1 or about 50:1 to about 10,000:1). All other considerations being equal, a cylindrically-shaped magnet of diameter 10 nm and length of 500 nm will have a much higher blocking temperature than that of a spherical magnet of 10 nm diameter. The highest spatial packing density of magnetic cylinders occurs for cylinders in a vertical hexagonal closed-packed arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In the bulk, pure cobalt is a soft ferromagnet of relatively low coercivity and not necessarily an ideal material for magnetic data storage. However, certain cobalt alloys have &ldquo;designer&rdquo; magnetic properties including engineered coercivity which makes them useful for present-day magnetic media applications. These cobalt alloys can be electro-deposited from a specific plating bath containing the relevant ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The techniques described herein can be used to create arrays useful for the next generation of magnetic data storage. Since the surface smoothness of such arrays can be important, it is considered desirable to utilize an auxiliary polymer to produce highly smooth films on substrate surfaces. Highly smooth films can be created by depositing polydimethylsiloxane on a diblock copolymer film, as described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/814,891, filed Mar. 22, 2001, titled &ldquo;Nanocylinder Arrays.&rdquo; The application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Engineered Magnetoresistance Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Magneto-electronic devices can be used for magnetic sensing applications (e.g., magnetic data storage) and for &ldquo;spintronics&rdquo; (e.g., MRAM). Appropriately chosen nanoscale magnetic architectures can result in improved performance since magnetic interactions can be tuned at the nanometer scale. The techniques described herein can be used to create devices in a variety of useful magneto-electronic configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Materials have been developed over the last ten years that are now used for magnetic sensing by utilizing their giant magnetoresistive (GMR) properties. These materials have various architectures, but in general are multilayered materials with layers of non-magnetic metals in contact with layers of magnetic metals. The magnetic interlayer-exchange-coupling and electron spin-dependent scattering lead to the sensitivity of resistance with respect to magnetic field. Tuning the structure of these systems by materials engineering allows magnetoresistive properties to be optimized for applications. GMR read heads in hard-disk drive technology is one important commercial application. These engineered materials systems are expected to advance with better materials and new material architectures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The magnetic arrays made using techniques described herein show GMR type behavior. However, the architecture of these arrays is significantly different than others that have been produced. The important consideration for GMR device design is that there be electrical contact between the substrate and the magnetic nanowires, not whether the wires are embedded in the template or not. Therefore, the wires can be grown (that is, electrodeposited) to less than the film thickness for GMR devices without a need to remove matrix material prior to operability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Of key importance to optimal performance of GMR devices is the ability to form a regular array of very small dimensions, for example, an array of 25.4 nanometer period made of cylinders 11 nanometers in diameter. Furthermore the fabrication processes described herein permit the well-controlled height of the cylinders, and the ability to multilayer the cylinder material as it is grown. These new processing considerations have allowed the creation of new geometrical architectures at size scales that have not been achieved using known fabrication processes. By tuning material structure in the fabrication processes described herein, a new breed of GMR materials is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> A particular embodiment of a GMR device is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The device is created by fabricating a magnetic nanoarray as described herein on a substrate patterned with an electrode. This particular magnetoresistive device is in a &ldquo;lateral transport&rdquo; configuration (the transport current is affected by the presence of the magnetic nanowires, but is not configured to pass through the wire along its length). Again, the matrix component of the copolymer is deleted from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> for clarity. The nanowires for such a device are desirably asymmetric magnetic heterostructures, as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>does not imply that in a given set of nanowires, all three types are used, rather that any one of the types can be employed in a set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Smart Media Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Smart media&rdquo; are media that sense this environment in a particular way, and create a measurable response. This could be, for example, a chemical sensor in which the device produces an electrical current when the presence of a particular type of molecule in solution is detected. Any electrical version of patterned smart media could be integrated with other signal processing on the same chip. Another example is a sensing medium that changes color upon sensing a change in chemical environment, temperature environment, optical stimulus, or other type of stimulus. Since the diblock systems are laterally patterned, arrays with large numbers of distinct sensing elements are fabricated. Each element is a localized transducer that is integrated into an on-chip circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Presently, the techniques described herein can be used to produce nanowire arrays with a nanoelement density of approximately 1.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>elements/in<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. This ultimately enables data storage technologies with storage capacities exceeding a terabit/in<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Patterned versions of high-density media in which one bit of data is encoded in the magnetization of a group of magnetic nanowires are created. The patterned diblock-derived devices described herein provide a simple fabrication route to high storage densities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Electrochemical Sensor Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> These sensors are used in a wide range of applications, including portable glucose detection for people with diabetes. The nanoporous templates disclosed herein are used conveniently to make devices for electrochemical sensing as an array of &ldquo;microelectrodes.&rdquo; In the electrochemistry literature the term &ldquo;microelectrode&rdquo; refers to a configuration of electrode that induces radial diffusion of an electrochemically-active species toward the electrode. The behavior of a microelectrode differs dramatically from that of a planar electrode. A nanoporous polymer template nanoelectrode array as described herein offers fast response, lower detection limits, and the possibility for molecular selectivity based on size or molecular interactions with the template. The lateral-patterning invention advances the use of nanoporous templates for this purpose because several distinct microelectrodes arrays are configured onto the same chip using patterned diblock templates atop a pre-patterned thin-film electrode set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Biomolecule Array Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Combinatorial chips are configured for DNA gene expression studies and other diagnostic applications. The nanoporous polymer templates described herein are patterned and filled with metals or silicon oxide that are used to attach biomolecules that will enable new types of biomolecular research capabilities. Patterned versions of such structures are of far greater usefulness. Another application for lateral patterning is to create structures for sorting molecules in nanoscales. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Molecular Electronics Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Specific types of molecules and small colloidal clusters are used as electronic devices. The goal is to &ldquo;design in&rdquo; electronic functionality (e.g., rectification, switching, negative differential resistance) by synthesizing molecules using certain types of end groups, aromatic rings and side groups. Interfacing these molecules for electrical characterization using known techniques is extremely challenging. However, new patterned nanoporous templates can be used as a practical host substrate for the characterization of specific types of electronically relevant molecules. The diblock template is patterned in regions atop pre-patterned gold electrodes. The molecules are adsorbed to the gold at the bottom of each pore using a thiol-gold interaction. This results in a self-assembled monolayer of the electronic molecules at the bottom of each pore. A counter electrode is deposited electrochemically atop the molecular layer and contacted using the patterned interconnections described above. This fabrication scheme enables convenient electrical characterization of candidate molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Photonic-Bandgap Structure Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> A photonic-bandgap crystal is a optical material that has periodically modulating dielectric constant. As a consequence of the periodic structure, the transmission properties become dependent on the incident light frequency such that certain frequencies, there is no transmission (the dispersion relation &ohgr;(k) is non-linear and has derivative of zero at Brillouin zone boundaries, k&equals;&pgr;/a, where a is the crystal lattice period). Using these materials, a range of devices can be configured in analogy to electronic devices. Once diblock copolymer systems can be made with a sufficiently long-range array order, they can be patterned in specific shapes to fabricate planar photonic-crystal waveguides and other photonic-crystal devices. Photonic waveguides are able to have much smaller turn radius as compared to optical fiber. Such waveguides can be used to interconnect on-chip optical components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Electrical Interconnections to Nanowires </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Electrical interconnections can be made to nanowires made by patterned diblock copolymer templates. This is achieved by integrating the templating process with other pre- and post-processing steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> An important step in utilizing electrical nanostructures is making appropriate electrical interfaces to these nanostructures. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, one embodiment of the present invention is realized. First, electrodes are prepatterned onto the substrate by a suitable lithographic technique. Secondly, a diblock copolymer film is deposited. Next, a metal layer is deposited. Finally, a conventional (photo- or e-beam-) resist is deposited. The cylinders of the diblock copolymer can be oriented by the techniques described herein. The resulting structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Selected areas of the top resist are exposed lithographically and removed by chemical development. Subsequently the exposed metal layer (&num;2) is removed by a metal etch. At this point the diblock film is exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light or an electronic beam, if it has not been exposed in a prior step. This structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The diblock film is now chemically developed with acetic acid or another suitable developer to result in a nanoporous template. If desired, the surface of the nanoporous template can be cleaned using a reactive ion etch with oxygen. This structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Nanowires or other suitable nanostructures are now deposited into the pores of the nanoporous template. To achieve top electrical contact, the deposition can continue until electrical connection is made with the top layer. As discussed herein, a range of different desired nanostructures can be deposited in the pores, depending on the target application. This structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In some applications, such as field emissions arrays, electrical contact to the top layer is not desired. Rather, the isolated top metal layer would be used as an electrical gate in a triode field emission device configuration. In other applications, metal contact &num;2 can be replaced over the deposited nanowires to complete contact through the wires, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The integration scheme described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> represents only one out of several schemes for integration and interfacing nanostructures made by patterned nanoporous templates. Nanofabrication via patterned diblock copolymers can be combined easily with other (pre- and post-) process steps, and done so such that the pattern is made in registry with previous lithographic patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Another fabrication scheme can be described as follows. First, electrodes are prepatterned onto the substrate by a suitable lithographic technique. Secondly, a diblock copolymer film is deposited. The diblock cyclinders are then oriented, exposed lithographically in a desired pattern, and then developed into a nanoporous template. Nanowires or other suitable nanostructures are now deposited into the pores of the nanoporous template. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> To achieve top electrical contact, or top non-contact electrodes, a suitable lithographic exposure and development, a ion etch performed to remove degraded portions (for example, oxide) from the top of the nanowires, and then deposition of metal electrodes in the contact areas. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> A Prototype Magnetoresistive Device </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are 10&times; optical images of a prototypical four-wire magnetoresistive device made by the inventors. An array of vertical magnetic nanowires stands atop a thin-film of gold pre-patterned into a four-probe resistor pattern. This device is used to investigate spin-dependent scattering in a &ldquo;current-in-plane&rdquo; (CIP) geometry where the scattering interface is geometrically periodic on the scale of tens of nanometers. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is an image of a substrate with a patterned electrode underlayer covered with an optically transparent diblock copolymer film layer prepared as described in Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The four probe resistor pattern was created as 2 &mgr;m in width and 100 &mgr;m in length, by standard electron beam lithography using a PMMA resist on a silicon substrate. The thin-film resistor includes a 20 nm thick gold layer on top of a 1 nm Cr adhesion layer. A 1.1 &mgr;m thick film of poly(styrene-&bgr;-methylmethacrylate) diblock copolymer denoted P(S-&bgr;-MMA) having 30% by volume polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with molecular weight of 42,000 Daltons was spun coated onto the patterned surface of substrate. This copolymer microphase separates into a hexagonal array of PMMA cylinders in a polystyrene (PS) matrix. Annealing thin films at 180&deg; C., above the glass transition temperature under an applied electric field, orients the PMMA cylinders normal to the film surface, enabling the fabrication of nanostructures with large aspect ratios. The sample was then exposed to an electron beam impinging on the sample in the shape of a square (area dose of 50 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, with beam energy and current used is 20 kV and 2000 pA, respectively. Generally, for such diblock films of about 1 micron, the exposure dose can range from about 20 to about 200 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, with accelerating voltages and beam currents as described above. Optimal doses have been found to be about 80 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The sample was then chemically developed with acetic acid. The original copolymer remains in the unexposed areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Cobalt nanowires were deposited in the pores on top of the gold pattern from an aqueous deposition bath, prepared by mixing 96 grams of CoSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and 13.5 grams H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>BO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in 300 ml pure H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, with 60 ml of methanol added as surfactant, resulting in an electrolyte pH of 3.7. The Co was electroplated at a reduction potential of &minus;1.0V with respect to a saturated calomel reference electrode. The nanowires were 500 nm in length. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is an image of the same sample after nanowire electrodeposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Structural information was obtained by performing small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The SAXS data confirms a perpendicular nanowire orientation with a period of 21.7 nm. The sample was cleaved in two, and FESEM used to examine a cross-section of the nanowire array. The diameter of the nanowires was found to be approximately 11 nm, with a period of 21.8 nm. At this scale, the individual magnetic nanowires should be single-domain in equilibrium, and show interesting magnetoresistance (MR) effects, since the interwire spacing is less than the spin diffusion length. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Giant Magnetoresistance Device and Measurements </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The four-wire magnetoresistive device prepared in Example 2 was used for measurement. The magnetic cobalt nanowire array is composed of 14 nm diameter wires, each 500 nm long, arranged in a hexagonal lattice with a period of 24 nm. The structure of the device was verified by small-angle X-ray scattering measurements. The magnetic field direction is parallel to the nanowire axis. A cross sectional scanning electron micrograph (SEM) image of such an array is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The GMR ratio as a function of temperature between 2K and 300K is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The data taken at 2K shows the largest amplitude curve, and that taken at 300K shows the smallest amplitude curve, with intermediate temperatures having intermediate values, with amplitudes in line with the ordering of the temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Other GMR ratios, as a function of orientation of magnetic field and temperature are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The magnetoresistance is defined as &lsqb;R(H)&minus;R(50 kOe)/R(50 kOe)&rsqb;. Again, the data taken at 2K shows the largest amplitude curve, and that taken at 300K shows the smallest amplitude curve, with intermediate temperatures having intermediate values, with amplitudes in line with the ordering of the temperature. In the &ldquo;perpendicular&rdquo; orientation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the field is normal to the plane of the Au film (parallel to the Co nanowires) and the current direction. For the &ldquo;transverse&rdquo; orientation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and &ldquo;longitudinal&rdquo; orientation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the field is in the plane of the gold film (perpendicular to the Co wires), but perpendicular or parallel to the current direction, respectively. The different shapes and values for the MR curves for the three orientations provide evidence for the coexistence of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) scattering mechanisms in this system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> MR behavior of the Co nanowires was also investigated as a function of gold film thickness and Co nanowire length. Gold films of 7.5, 10 and 20 nm thickness were studied with Co nanowires of 500 nm. Also, samples of Co nanowire lengths of 100 and 500 nm were prepared having gold film thickness of 20 nm. MR behavior was found to depend principally on nanowire length. A plot of normalized MR<highlight><subscript>max </subscript></highlight>for a perpendicular orientation at 0 field versus temperature for various gold film thicknesses and Co nanowire lengths is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The characteristics clearly indicate that the temperature dependence of MR is strongly dependent on the Co nanowire length, but not so strongly on the gold film thickness. Each data set is normalized to its 2K value for comparison. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention relates to an all gas-phase process for the purification of single-wall carbon nanotubes and the purified single-wall carbon nanotube material. Known methods of single-wall carbon nanotube production result in a single-wall carbon nanotube product that contains single-wall carbon nanotubes in addition to impurities including residual metal catalyst particles and amounts of small amorphous carbon sheets that surround the catalyst particles and appear on the sides of the single-wall carbon nanotubes and &ldquo;ropes&rdquo; of single-wall carbon nanotubes. The purification process removes the extraneous carbon as well as metal-containing residual catalyst particles. The process comprises oxidation of the single-wall carbon nanotube material, reduction and reaction of a halogen-containing gas with the metal-containing species. The oxidation step may be done dry or in the presence of water vapor. The present invention provides a scalable means for producing high-purity single-wall carbon nanotube material. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Fullerenes are spheroidal, closed-cage molecules consisting essentially of sp<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>-hybridized carbons typically arranged in hexagons and pentagons. Fullerenes, such as C<highlight><subscript>60</subscript></highlight>, also known as Buckminsterfullerene, more commonly, &ldquo;buckyballs,&rdquo; and C<highlight><subscript>70</subscript></highlight>, have been produced from vaporized carbon at high temperature. Presence of a transition metal catalyst with the high temperature vaporized carbon results in the formation of single-wall tubular structures which may be sealed at one or both ends with a semifullerene dome. These carbon cylindrical structures, known as single-wall carbon nanotubes or, commonly, &ldquo;buckytubes&rdquo; have extraordinary properties, including both electrical and thermal conductivity and high strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Nested single-wall carbon cylinders, known as multi-wall carbon nanotubes, possess properties similar to the single-wall carbon nanotubes; however, single-wall carbon nanotubes have fewer defects, rendering them stronger, more conductive, and typically more useful than multi-wall carbon nanotubes of similar diameter. Single-wall carbon nanotubes are believed to be much more free of defects than are multi-wall carbon nanotubes because multi-wall carbon nanotubes can survive occasional defects by forming bridges between the unsaturated carbon of the neighboring cylinders, whereas single-wall carbon nanotubes have no neighboring walls for defect compensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In defining the size and conformation of single-wall carbon nanotubes, the system of nomenclature described by Dresselhaus et al., <highlight><italic>Science of Fullerenes and Carbon Nanotubes, </italic></highlight>1996, San Diego: Academic Press, Ch. 19, will be used. Single-wall tubular fullerenes are distinguished from each other by a double index (n, m), where n and m are integers that describe how to cut a single strip of hexagonal graphite such that its edges join seamlessly when the strip is wrapped onto the surface of a cylinder. When n&equals;m, the resultant tube is said to be of the &ldquo;arm-chair&rdquo; or (n, n) type, since when the tube is cut perpendicularly to the tube axis, only the sides of the hexagons are exposed and their pattern around the periphery of the tube edge resembles the arm and seat of an arm chair repeated n times. When m&equals;0, the resultant tube is said to be of the &ldquo;zig zag&rdquo; or (n, 0) type, since when the tube is cut perpendicular to the tube axis, the edge is a zig zag pattern. Where n&ne;m and m&ne;0, the resulting tube has chirality. The electronic properties are dependent on the conformation, for example, arm-chair tubes are metallic and have extremely high electrical conductivity. Other tube types are metallic, semimetals or semi-conductors, depending on their conformation. Regardless of tube type, all single-wall nanotubes have extremely high thermal conductivity and tensile strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Several methods of synthesizing fullerenes have developed from the condensation of vaporized carbon at high temperature. Fullerenes, such as C<highlight><subscript>60 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>70</subscript></highlight>, may be prepared by carbon arc methods using vaporized carbon at high temperature. Carbon nanotubes have also been produced as one of the deposits on the cathode in carbon arc processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Single-wall carbon nanotubes have been made in a DC arc discharge apparatus by simultaneously evaporating carbon and a small percentage of Group VIIIb transition metal from the anode of the arc discharge apparatus. These techniques allow production of only a low yield of carbon nanotubes, and the population of carbon nanotubes exhibits significant variations in structure and size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another method of producing single-wall carbon nanotubes involves laser vaporization of a graphite substrate doped with transition metal atoms (such as nickel, cobalt, or a mixture thereof) to produce single-wall carbon nanotubes. The single-wall carbon nanotubes produced by this method tend to be formed in clusters, termed &ldquo;ropes,&rdquo; of about 10 to about 1000 single-wall carbon nanotubes in parallel alignment, held by van der Waals forces in a closely packed triangular lattice. Nanotubes produced by this method vary in structure, although one structure tends to predominate. Although the laser vaporization process produces an improved yield of single-wall carbon nanotubes, the product is still heterogeneous, and the nanotubes tend to be too tangled for many potential uses of these materials. In addition, the laser vaporization of carbon is a high energy process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another way to synthesize carbon nanotubes is by catalytic decomposition of a carbon-containing gas by nanometer-scale metal particles supported on a substrate. The carbon feedstock molecules decompose on the particle surface, and the resulting carbon atoms then precipitate as part of a nanotube from one side of the particle. This procedure typically produces imperfect multi-walled carbon nanotubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another method for production of single-wall carbon nanotubes involves the disproportionation of CO to form single-wall carbon nanotubes and CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>on alumina-supported transition metal particles comprising Mo, Fe, Ni, Co, or mixtures thereof. This method uses inexpensive feedstocks in a moderate temperature process. However, the yield is limited due to rapid surrounding of the catalyst particles by a dense tangle of single-wall carbon nanotubes, which acts as a barrier to diffusion of the feedstock gas to the catalyst surface, limiting further nanotube growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Control of ferrocene/benzene partial pressures and addition of thiophene as a catalyst promoter in an all-gas-phase process can produce single-wall carbon nanotubes. However, this method suffers from simultaneous production of multi-wall carbon nanotubes, amorphous carbon, and other products of hydrocarbon pyrolysis under the high temperature conditions necessary to produce high quality single-wall carbon nanotubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> More recently, a method for producing single-wall carbon nanotubes has been reported that uses high pressure CO as the carbon feedstock and a gaseous transition metal catalyst precursor as the catalyst. (&ldquo;Gas Phase Nucleation and Growth of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes from High Pressure Carbon Monoxide,&rdquo; International Pat. Publ. WO 00/26138, published May 11, 2000 (&ldquo;WO 00/26138&rdquo;), incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). This method possesses many advantages over other earlier methods. For example, the method can be done continuously, and it has the potential for scale-up to produce commercial quantities of single-wall carbon nanotubes. Another significant advantage of this method is its effectiveness in making single-wall carbon nanotubes without simultaneously making multi-wall nanotubes. Furthermore, the method produces single-wall carbon nanotubes in relatively high purity, such that less than about 10 wt % of the carbon in the solid product is attributable to other carbon-containing species, which includes both graphitic and amorphous carbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> All known processes for formation of single-wall nanotubes involve a transition-metal catalyst, residues of which are invariably present in the as-produced material. Likewise, these processes also entail production of varying amounts of carbon material that is not in the form of single-wall nanotubes. In the following, this non-nanotube carbon material is referred to as &ldquo;amorphous carbon.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> There are chemical processes involving single-wall carbon nanotube manipulation for specific applications, such as, for example, &ldquo;Chemical Derivatization Of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes To Facilitate Solvation Thereof; And Use Of Derivatized Nanotubes,&rdquo; International Pat. Publ. WO 00/17101, published Mar. 30, 2000, and &ldquo;Carbon Fibers Formed From Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes,&rdquo; International Pat. Publ. WO 98/39250, published Sep. 11, 1998, both of which are incorporated by reference herein. Many of these manipulation processes involve chemical reaction of the single-wall carbon nanotube sides and/or ends with other chemicals. These processes also often involve the physical interaction (through van der Waals or other inter-molecular forces) of nanotubes with one another or interaction of nanotubes with other matter within which they are suspended, encapsulated, or otherwise placed in proximity. Clearly, in performing a chemical or physical interaction process with nanotube material, any impurities present are likely to inhibit or modify such manipulation process and/or physical interactions making it difficult or even impossible to achieve the intended result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> One example of a nanotube interaction that has many uses is the process of self-assembly of nanotubes. Under some conditions, individual nanotubes self-assemble into &ldquo;ropes&rdquo; of many parallel nanotubes in van der Waals contact with one another. See, e.g., &ldquo;Macroscopic Ordered Assembly of Carbon Nanotubes,&rdquo; International Pat. Publ. WO 01/30694 A1, published May 3, 2001, incorporated herein by reference. Likewise, individual single-wall carbon nanotube and ropes of single-wall carbon nanotube, can be caused to aggregate into large networks, which are themselves electrically conductive. This self-assembly process enables nanotubes and ropes of nanotubes to form such networks when they are suspended in a matrix of a different material. The presence of this network alters the electrical properties of a composite that includes nanotubes. The facility with which single-wall carbon nanotubes aggregate into ropes and networks is critically dependent upon the purity of the nanotube material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Another example of nanotube manipulation is the chemical processing of nanotubes by reacting them with other chemicals to produce new materials and devices. Clearly, the presence of other species such as the transition metal catalyst or amorphous carbon material provides sites for chemical reaction processes that are distinct from the desired chemical reaction process involving the nanotube alone. As with any species involved in a chemical process, one seeks to perform that process with a pure species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Likewise, the useful properties and behavior of nanotube-containing materials devices and articles of manufacture derive from the properties of the nanotubes themselves, and the absence of impurities in the nanotube material enhances the performance of any and all materials, devices, and articles of manufacture comprising nanotubes. Particular examples are those where the material, device, or article of manufacture must function in a high magnetic field or a chemically-active environment. Examples of such materials, device and articles would include those subjected to traditional nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus; those serving as electrodes in batteries, capacitors, sensors, and fuel cells; those implanted in or otherwise in contact with any living organism; those used in preparation of other materials requiring low-contamination environments (such as chemical apparatus, chemical storage devices, electronic materials and devices, or food processing equipment). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In environments where there are chemicals, such as oxygen, that react with the nanotubes at elevated temperatures, the presence of metallic particles reduces the temperature at which the nanotube material remains stable. This occurs because transition metals and transition metal compounds are known to catalyze the reaction of the nanotubes with other chemicals, such as oxygen, at elevated temperatures. High purity nanotubes, with the transition metal species substantially removed, would provide greater chemical stability to the nanotubes and a longer performance life to applications involving them. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to purified single-wall carbon nanotubes and means for their preparation. Known methods of single-wall carbon nanotube production all result in a product that contains single-wall carbon nanotubes in addition to impurities such as particles of the metal catalyst used in single-wall carbon nanotube production and small amounts of amorphous carbon sheets that surround the catalyst particles and appear on the sides of the single-wall carbon nanotubes and &ldquo;ropes&rdquo; of single-wall carbon nanotubes produced. The purification process removes the extraneous carbon as well as metal-containing residual catalyst particles. The process comprises oxidation of the single-wall carbon nanotube material, reduction of any oxidized metal species, and reaction of a halogen-containing gas with the metal-containing species in the as-produced single-wall carbon nanotube material. The oxidation step can be performed in a dry atmosphere or in an atmosphere comprising water vapor. The oxidation is performed at a temperature of at least about 200&deg; C. In one embodiment, the process also includes repetition of the oxidation and halogenation reaction steps at the same or at higher subsequent oxidation temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Many processing methods and articles of manufacture involving single-wall carbon nanotube are enhanced by the use of pure single-wall carbon nanotube material in which the presence of such impurities is minimized. There is a clear need for pure nanotube material and methods for its production. The present invention relates to such high-purity nanotube material, specific means for the production of the material, and articles of manufacture incorporating said material. The purification methods disclosed involve all gas-phase chemical treatments of the as-produced single-wall carbon nanotube material. The methods disclosed are scalable to provide for large amounts of high-purity single-wall carbon nanotube material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The material of this invention provides a superior nanotube material for applications because of the relative absence of impurities of metal and amorphous carbon, both of which exhibit different chemical, physical, and electrical behavior than the single-wall carbon nanotubes themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Single-wall carbon nanotubes, purified to remove residual metal, are more stable and resistant to chemical attack at temperatures where metal-containing nanotube material would be chemically reactive. One example of such chemical attack would be oxidation of the nanotube material in air at temperatures exceeding 200&deg; C. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the presence of transition metal impurities in the nanotube material catalyzes the oxidation of that material; and removal of the transition metal impurities would increase the oxidation temperature of nanotube material in air to over 600&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention enables the chemical processing of nanotubes by providing high purity single-wall carbon nanotubes for reactions with other chemicals to produce new materials and devices. The present invention also enables aggregation of the single-wall carbon nanotubes into ropes and networks and therefore enables all articles of manufacture, materials and processes that depend on the propensity of single-wall carbon nanotubes and ropes of single-wall carbon nanotubes to aggregate. Such entities include composite materials comprising single-wall carbon nanotubes wherein the materials&apos; electrical, mechanical, optical, and/or thermal properties are enhanced by the presence of nanotube networks within the material. Such materials include bulk composite materials, paints, coatings, and adhesives whose electrical, mechanical, optical, and/or thermal properties depend in part on the presence of nanotube networks therein, electrical circuitry, electronic devices (including batteries, capacitors, transistors, memory elements, current control elements, and switches) whose properties and function depend in part on the presence of nanotube networks therein. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a method for producing highly-purified single-wall carbon nanotube material in which the metal catalyst used in the production process and amorphous carbon generated in the production process are substantially removed. In one embodiment, the material contains less than about 5 wt % metal. In another embodiment of this invention, the single-wall carbon nanotube material contains less than about 1 wt % metal. Yet in another embodiment of this invention, the single-wall carbon nanotube material contains less than about 0.1 wt % metal. Additionally, in an embodiment of the present invention, single-wall carbon nanotube material contains less than about 5% by weight amorphous carbon. In another embodiment of the invention, single-wall carbon nanotube material of this invention contains less than about 1 wt % amorphous carbon and yet in another embodiment of this invention, single-wall carbon nanotube material contains less than about 0.2 wt % amorphous carbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> This purified material comprises a fundamental improvement in products and articles of manufacture that incorporate single-wall carbon nanotubes, and it enables new and improved articles of manufacture, including, but not limited to: composite materials with electrical, mechanical, electromagnetic or chemical properties deriving in part from single-wall carbon nanotubes contained therein; electrodes of fuel cells, capacitors or batteries, particularly lithium-ion batteries; catalyst supports, structure-modifying additives for vehicle tires and laminated composites, including high-strength carbon fiber composites, anti-corrosion and other electrochemical materials and coatings; fibers containing or comprised entirely of single-wall carbon nanotubes; chemical, physical, and electronic sensors; films and coatings; inks and conducting materials that may be printed in any way; electrically and thermally conductive coatings, electrically and thermally conductive composite materials, electromagnetic and radio-frequency shielding materials; field emission cathodes; biologically-compatible coatings, objects and devices that are inserted or implanted into living organisms; radar-absorbing materials, optically-active materials and devices; components of systems that convert sunlight to electrical energy; electronic devices including transistors, pass elements, capacitors, inductors, resistors, connectors, switches, wires, interconnections devices and antennae at frequencies up to and including optical frequencies; electronic circuit fabrication materials; electrical and thermal conducting materials, transducers, electrical transmission cable, high-strength fiber, and structural elements of machines, buildings, and vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The fundamental improvements enabled by purified single-wall carbon nanotubes in all the foregoing applications derive primarily from the enhanced properties of purified single-wall carbon nanotubes to interact with other single-wall carbon nanotubes, with other materials in composite applications, with other chemicals, and with liquid agents that dissolve or suspend single-wall carbon nanotubes. This enhanced interaction, in turn, permits use of lower concentrations of single-wall carbon nanotubes in some applications, and improves the desired electrical, chemical, and/or mechanical properties of the materials, devices and/or other entities comprising single-wall carbon nanotubes in these and other applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> This invention provides novel means of removing known impurities, such as metal catalyst and amorphous carbon, from as-made single-wall carbon nanotube material. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a typical single-wall carbon nanotube sample produced by the laser-oven process (See Rinzler, et al., <highlight><italic>Applied Physics A </italic></highlight>1998 67, 29). Impurities in the form of 2-10 nanometer diameter metal particles and amorphous carbon are evident. Embodiments of this invention include means for removal of impurities as well as the purified material itself. In the present invention, impurities are removed by reacting the impurities to form other compounds that are either volatile or easily removable by subsequent process. The impurities contain metal-containing species from residual catalyst metal and amorphous carbon. One means disclosed for removing the metal-containing impurities is by chemical reaction with halogen-containing gases, such as Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and Br<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, HCl, HF, HI and HBr. The resulting metal halide formed by reaction between the halogen-containing gas and the metal can be volatilized for removal, such as by heating the material to be purified in a chamber which is cleared of volatile species by applying a vacuum, by purging the chamber with an inert gas, or by condensing the volatiles on a cold trap or surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Removing the residual catalyst metal impurity from the single-wall carbon nanotube product is problematic because the metal is usually encapsulated by a carbon coating which hinders access of reactants to the metal. Generally, the product from all known processes for producing single-wall carbon nanotubes contains catalyst impurity in the form of small 2-20 nanometer-diameter particles that are encapsulated with a layer or multiple layers of amorphous carbon. This encapsulation inhibits the access of other chemicals to the metal, and all heretofore-known purification processes leave substantial amounts of metal catalyst because of its relative inaccessibility to chemical attack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The present invention incorporates a gas-phase means for accessing the encapsulated metal and converting it to other removable compounds. The initial step in the process of this invention uses gaseous reagents that diffuse through defects in the encapsulation and react with the metal to form compounds such as metal oxides and hydroxides. Gaseous reagents often comprise oxidizing gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and can contain water vapor. The metal oxides and metal hydroxides formed when the oxidizing gases react with metal occupy a larger volume than the original metallic impurity. The larger volume of the metal oxides and hydroxides promotes further cracks, fissures and defects in the carbon that encapsulates the metallic impurities. The more pronounced the defects and fissures in the encapsulating carbon, the more accessible the metal-containing species are to the gaseous reagents used for further reaction with the encapsulated metal species. The enhanced cracks and fissures facilitate both the access of the gaseous reagents for reaction with the metal-containing species and the egress of the reacted metal compounds, thereby enabling greater metal removal in the purification process. The gas-phase oxidation can be conducted at pressures in the range of about 0.01 and about 100 atmospheres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The amorphous carbon encapsulating the metal-containing catalyst particles and other amorphous carbon formed as a by-product of the single-wall carbon nanotube production process are removed by direct reaction with gaseous reagents, typically gases capable of oxidizing or otherwise reacting with the carbon, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. These reactions can be catalyzed by the original catalyst metal in the as-produced material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Treatment of the impure sample with hydrogen is desirable after oxidation. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the hydrogen treatment reduces metal oxides, hydroxides and carbides that may be present and that may be more resistant to subsequent metal removal steps than in their non-reduced states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Generally, the gas-phase procedure for purifying single-wall carbon nanotubes comprises the steps of oxidation, reduction, and reaction of the metal-containing species with a halogen-containing gas. The procedure can further comprise annealing at high temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The oxidation step serves a two-fold purpose. The first purpose is to remove amorphous carbon by oxidizing the amorphous carbon species to carbon oxides. This carbon oxidation is catalyzed by metal in close contact with the amorphous carbon, such as, for example the carbon that encapsulates the residual catalyst metal-containing species. The other purpose of oxidation is to convert the metal-containing catalyst particles into metal oxides and hydroxides. Since the metal oxides and hydroxides are larger in volume than the metal catalyst particles, they cause further cracking and fracturing of the carbon encapsulation. The oxidation is done in an oxidizing gaseous atmosphere, preferably comprising oxygen or carbon dioxide. The oxygen or carbon dioxide concentration can range from about 1 vol % to about 100 vol %, preferably about 1 vol % to about 30 vol %. Nitrogen or inert gases, such as argon, can be used to dilute the oxygen or carbon dioxide concentration. The oxidation temperature can range from about 200&deg; C. to about 500&deg; C. The oxidation time can range from about 1 hour to about 20 hours. Shorter times are preferable when expediency is desired. Water vapor can be added to the oxidizing gaseous atmosphere and the water vapor concentration can range up to the saturation limit of the gas used to introduce the water vapor into the reaction chamber. The water vapor concentration can range from about 0.5 vol % to about 50 vol %, but is generally, from about 0.5 vol % to about 10 vol %, and, more commonly, 0.5 vol % to about 5 vol %. Water vapor in the oxidation promotes the formation of metal hydroxide species, as well as keeps the single-wall carbon nanotubes more dispersible for subsequent processing. The formation of metal hydroxides, like the metal oxides, promotes the fissuring and cracking of the carbon encapsulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> After oxidation, the reaction chamber can be evacuated by vacuum or purged with an inert gas. A gas comprising hydrogen can be introduced to reduce any metal carbides, oxides or hydroxides. The temperature of reduction can range from about 250&deg; C. to about 500&deg; C. The concentration of hydrogen gas can range from about 1 vol % to about 100 vol %. The total pressure during reduction can range from about 1 Torr to about 760 Torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> After hydrogen reduction, the reactor can be evacuated by vacuum or purged with nitrogen or an inert gas, such as argon. The next step is reaction of the metal-containing impurities to other metal-containing species that can be volatilized with heat, or otherwise removed in a gaseous state. The metal-containing impurities can include pure metals, metal carbides, metal oxides and metal hydroxides. The preferred reactions with the metal-containing impurities are those of halogenation with a halogen-containing gas. The halogen-containing gas can be comprised of a halogen-containing compound such as Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Br<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, HCl, HBr, HF, HI, or other halogen-containing compounds that can react with the metal-containing impurities to form metal halides. Preferably, the halogen-containing gas comprises HCl or Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The halogenation reaction temperature can range from about 400&deg; C. to about 850&deg; C. The reaction time can range from about 30 minutes to about 2 hours. The concentration of the halogen-containing compound in the halogen-containing gas can range from about 1 vol % to about 100 vol %. The pressure of the halogenation reaction can range from about 1 Torr to about 760 Torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Following the halogenation reaction step, the metal halide species formed are removed. Removal can be accomplished by evacuating the reaction chamber by applying a vacuum to the chamber. Removal can also be accomplished by purging the reaction chamber with nitrogen or an inert gas, such as argon, at temperatures of at least about 400&deg; C. to sweep out the volatile metal halides, or by simply providing a cold trap, or other cool surface, in or contiguous with the reaction chamber, upon which the volatile halides condense as solid material, and which is subsequently removed from the reaction chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> After the reaction chamber has been either evacuated or flushed to remove the volatile metal halides, the single-wall carbon nanotube material can be subjected to one or more subsequent oxidation/reduction/halogenation cycles, either at the same or higher temperatures. When performing more oxidation/reduction/halogenation cycles at higher temperatures, the temperature of any part of the cycle can be increased in increments of about 50&deg; C. up to the oxidation and reduction temperatures of about 500&deg; C. and the maximum halogenation temperature of about 850&deg; C. The oxidation temperature may be raised to higher temperatures (such as, for example, 800&deg; C.); however, as such high temperatures may cause degradation of the single-wall carbon nanotubes over time, care must be taken to limit the time of exposure of the single-wall carbon nanotubes to such high temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Optionally, annealing can be done as part of the purification procedure. Annealing has several benefits, including removing more amorphous carbon and correcting defects in the single-wall carbon nanotubes. Annealing can be done in a vacuum or in a gas comprising nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or an inert gas, such as argon. Annealing is preferably done at a temperature in the range of about 600&deg; C. to about 1000&deg; C. Annealing time can be on the order of about an hour. Water vapor can be used with nitrogen, carbon dioxide or any inert gas used in annealing. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that water vapor has the benefit of reducing the susceptibility of adjacent single-wall carbon nanotubes to bond together during annealing. Water vapor in the annealing gas mixture, thus, can provide the benefit of providing single-wall carbon nanotubes that are more dispersible after purification. The concentration of water vapor during annealing can be in the range from about 0.5 vol % to about 50 vol %, preferably 0.5 vol % to about 10 vol %, and more preferably 0.5 vol % to about 5 vol %. After annealing, the single-wall carbon nanotubes can be cooled in a vacuum, nitrogen or an inert gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> This invention comprises embodiments that use entirely gas-phase procedures, as illustrated in the examples. The gas-phase methods have advantages over procedures involving a liquid-phase step. One advantage is that the material retains its original bulk density and is not densified and matted, which can occur in processes involving liquid wetting and cause difficulty in redispersing the single-wall carbon nanotubes. In purification procedures involving wetting with water or some other solvent that is used in the final washing process, subsequent evaporative drying causes the single-wall carbon nanotube sample to become more than order of magnitude denser than the initial raw material whose density is of the order 0.01 g/cc. This occurs because capillary forces cause a collapse of the space between small ropes of the single-wall carbon nanotubes that exist in the original sample. The denser product is more difficult to disperse in solvents; and for applications requiring dispersal of the nanotubes as individual single-wall carbon nanotube segments or ropes of single-wall carbon nanotubes, the all-gas phase methods are preferred. Additionally, the all-gas phase methods do not involve a liquid-solid separation step which can be time consuming, difficult and more expensive when purifying large quantities of single-wall carbon nanotube material. The all gas-phase purification methods disclosed here are rapid, effective, adaptable to continuous processing, and readily scalable for processing large quantities of single-wall carbon nanotube material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is an entirely gas-phase method for removing metals and non-nanotube carbon from as produced single-wall carbon nanotube samples. The approach preserves the high porosity of the original sample because a liquid removal step is not required. In this procedure, a low temperature metal-catalyzed gas phase oxidation step is utilized to remove non-nanotube carbon and facilitate the subsequent reaction and removal of the metal as a volatile metal halide by reaction with halogen-containing gases, such as HCl or Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. All pure halogen gases, chlorine, bromine, fluorine, and iodine, as well as their gaseous acids (HCl, HBr, HF, and HI) function in the procedure. Removal of the resulting metal halide is accomplished by heating to temperatures sufficient to volatilize the particular metal halide. The temperatures required for volatilization of the metal halides are generally greater than about 400&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> This procedure differs from a previously-described all gas-phase purification procedure disclosed in &ldquo;Gas-Phase Purification of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes,&rdquo; John L. Zimmerman, et al., Chem. Materials, 12, 1361-1366, 2000, incorporated herein by reference, in that it separates the oxidative removal of non-nanotube carbon from the removal of the metal. This is important because it allows for low temperature catalytic oxidation of carbon shells that surround the metal clusters present in the as-made single-wall carbon nanotube material. The presence of a halide-containing gas during this step can poison the catalytic oxidation process. A low temperature metal-catalyzed oxidation step permits selective removal of the shell carbon because of its close proximity to the metal oxide catalyst. Thus, carbon shells can be removed without substantial loss of single-wall carbon nanotubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In this example, relatively high purity single-wall carbon nanotube material made by the process described in WO 00/26138 (see also Nikolaev, et al. <highlight><italic>Chemical Physics Letters </italic></highlight>1999, 313, 91 (&ldquo;Nikolaev&rdquo;)) and containing approximately 3 to 4 atomic % iron is purified to effectively remove metal and non-nanotube carbon using the following steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> 1. Heat the single-wall carbon nanotube material in air at about 250&deg; C. for <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 2. Evacuate the chamber and fill it with either pure HCl gas or a gaseous mixture comprising HCl and nitrogen, or an inert gas, such as argon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> 3. Heat the material in the chamber to about 800&deg; C. and hold for about one hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> 4. While maintaining the chamber temperature at about 800&deg; C., flush the chamber with nitrogen or an inert gas and pull a vacuum. Hold the chamber at about 800&deg; C. for about one hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> 5. Cool in the vacuum to the next air oxidation temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> 6. Repeat the above process beginning with Step 1 using an air oxidation temperature of about 350&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Using these steps, the iron content of relatively pure single-wall carbon nanotube material is reduced from about 3-4 atomic % to about 0.3 atomic %, as determined by thermo-gravimetric analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Both non-nanotube carbon and metal are much less evident in TEM images of gas-phase-purified single-wall carbon nanotube samples when compared to the original material. The porosity and density of the sample appears essentially the same as the starting material. Variations of the process can involve use of wet air rather than dry air in the oxidation steps. Also the oxidation of the samples can be carried out in more than one furnace for convenience or economic reasons. Another method for removing the metal halide can be done by heating in an inert gas stream rather than performing the evacuation step. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this example, single-wall carbon nanotube material made by the process described in WO 00/26138 (see also Nikolaev) and containing up to about 7 atomic % iron is purified using the following steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> 1. Evacuate the reaction chamber containing the single-wall carbon nanotube material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> 2. Fill the chamber with approximately 500 Torr of anhydrous HCl at a temperature in the range of about 250&deg; C. to about 400&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> 3. Heat the chamber to a temperature in the range of about 800&deg; C. to about 850&deg; C. for 30 to 45 minutes with the chamber pressure of approximately 700 Torr. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Using these steps, the iron content of the single-wall carbon nanotube material is reduced from about 6-7 atomic % to about 0.2-1.2 atomic %, as determined by thermo-gravimetric analysis. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention is directed to a polymer comprising amine groups dispersed throughout the polymer backbone which enable ionic movement for use in various applications. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a conductive polyamine-based polymer electrolyte, which may optionally be cross-linked and which is suitable for use in, for example, batteries, fuel cells, sensors, supercapacitors and electrochromic devices, as well as to methods for the preparation thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Society continues to place more and more stringent demands on existing sources of energy, requiring that they be more efficient, more environmentally friendly, etc. For example, as developments in microelectronics continue to advance, the need for smaller, lighter, more powerful, and/or longer lasting energy sources increases. As a result, existing battery technologies have been stretched to their limits, requiring new technologies to be developed. Similarly, as environmental issues, such as pollution or emission controls and resource conservation, continue to be given more attention, alternative energy sources, such as the use of high energy density batteries or fuel cells, grow in importance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Currently, efforts remained focused on the development of improved secondary, or rechargeable, cells, having high energy densities. While there are many different types of secondary cells, lithium ion cells are an area of emphasis because, as compared to most other systems, they possess longer lifetimes and higher capacities. Generally speaking, current state-of-the-art lithium cells, or batteries, consist of (i) a cathode, (ii) an anode, both of which are made of a material capable of intercalating/deintercalating lithium ions (the positive electrode intercalating during discharge and the negative electrode during charge), lithium being preferred because it is a high specific energy material, and (iii) an electrolyte. More specifically, current secondary lithium cells employ lithium metal or lithium ions in carbon as the anode, a chalcogenide salt (such as, for example, Li<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Mn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, Li<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>CoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LiV<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>and Li<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>NiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) as the cathode, and a liquid or solid electrolyte. During discharge of a cell having lithium metal as the anode, lithium metal is oxidized into lithium ions at the anode, the ions then undergoing an intercalation reaction at the cathode; the reverse process at each electrode occurs during charging of the cell. For cells where both the anode and cathode are made of lithium ion intercalation materials, lithium metal is not involved and all redox processes occur in the intercalate matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The composition or form of the electrolyte employed in these cells is of particular interest. For example, while many liquid electrolytes have high conductivities, their use is problematic because of concerns over leakage of hazardous materials and loss of performance resulting from drying due to evaporation and/or leakage. Solid electrolytes are particularly attractive since they offer new opportunities in design that are not available with liquid electrolytes. For example, solid polymeric electrolytes possessing elastomeric properties are attractive because they would be able to expand/contract within the cell to ensure continuous and full interfacial contact with the electrodes as volume changes within the cell occur in operation; additionally, such elastomeric properties would enable cells containing these electrolytes to be more easily fabricated. Another advantage of solid electrolytes is the fact that they would essentially eliminate concerns over leakage and drying problems experienced with liquid compositions. Finally, such electrolytes may be formed into thin films to minimize resistance and to reduce overall volume and weight of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Polymers which have been examined for use as solid electrolytes include those based upon linear chain polyethers, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (&ldquo;PEO&rdquo;) and poly(propylene oxide) (&ldquo;PPO&rdquo;), with associated alkali metal salts (see, e.g., Le Nest et al., <highlight><italic>Polymer Comm., </italic></highlight>28, pp. 302-305 (1987); and, Tsuchida et al., <highlight><italic>Macromol., </italic></highlight>88, pp. 96-100 (1988)). However, such electrolytes display conductivity in the range of practical use (e.g., &sgr;&equals;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>S/cm) only at temperatures well above room temperature. In addition to exhibiting poor conductivity, particularly at room temperature, acceptable physical properties are lacking as well; for example, these polymers typically form thin films which are tacky (the polymers at times being too close to the liquid state), brittle, or too heat sensitive. While many of the deficiencies in physical properties may be addressed by the addition of a plasticizer, poor conductivity remains an issue. Additionally, while some have proposed the use of gel electrolytes (such as those containing poly(vinylidene fluoride), or &ldquo;PVdF&rdquo;), these too have been found to exhibit insufficient conductivity at room temperature, and to lack desirable physical properties (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,998,559). One very common problem with gel electrolytes, often formed by the addition of an electrolytic solution to a polymer matrix, is that they have problems with leakage or evaporation of the electrolyte solution, the matrix being unable to contain the electrolyte solution over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Due to its structural similarities to PEO and PPO, others have also investigated the use of poly(ethylenimine) (&ldquo;PEI&rdquo;), as well as various derivatives thereof, as a solid polymer electrolyte. (See, e.g., Yokomichi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,196; M. Watanabe et al., <highlight><italic>Macromol., </italic></highlight>20, pp. 968-73 (1987); J. Paul et al., <highlight><italic>Electrochimica Acta, </italic></highlight>37, pp. 1623-25 (1992); and, R. Tanaka et al., <highlight><italic>Solid State Ionics, </italic></highlight>60, pp.119-23 (1993).) However, while various forms of PEI have been studied, including (i) linear PEI, (ii) a PEI polymer backbone with PEO side chains extending from the nitrogen atoms in the backbone, and (ii) branched PEI (including methylated PEI), a commercially viable PEI-based electrolyte has not been produced; that is, while various forms of PEI have been studied, as yet no form has been identified as an electrolyte having both electrical and mechanical properties making it suitable for use in commercial applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, it can be seen that a need continues to exist for a solid polymer electrolyte suitable for use in a number of commercial applications. Ideally, the electrolyte would possess high conductivity while having superior mechanical properties (i.e., strength, elasticity, electrochemical stability, etc.) for the desired application. In addition, such an electrolyte would be easily and inexpensively manufactured, and capable of being formed, extruded, etc. into any of a number of desired shapes or forms. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a conductive polymer has been discovered which has desirable mechanical properties (e.g., strength, elasticity, flexibility) and electrical properties (e.g., high conductivity for metal ions as well as protons), as well as excellent processability. The polymer is suitable for use as an electrolyte in, for example, fuel cells, sensors, supercapacitors, electrochromic devices, and batteries (e.g., primary or gradient, as further described herein). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present polymer comprises amine groups in the polymer chain or backbone. The polymer may be linear or branched, and may be covalently cross-linked. The polymer further comprises, for one or more embodiments as further described herein: (i) a dissolved or dispersed metal salt; (ii) an attached or tethered solvent moiety; (iii) a swelling solvent; and/or (iv) labile protons. In still other embodiments, the polymer may be in the form of a covalently cross-linked, low density, continuous, homogeneous film (as compared, for example, to conventional PEI polymers, such as those prepared by Takahasi et al., <highlight><italic>Solid State tonics, </italic></highlight>18 &amp; 19 (1986) pp. 321-25, which were formed by pressing and heating a paste of a dissolved metal salt, linear PEI and diepoxyoctane; a continuous film, in contrast, being substantially free of the chemical boundaries present in electrolytes formed in this way). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiments, the polymer is used to construct a gradient battery, or a battery wherein a single, continuous electrolyte phase extends from one collector to the other. More specifically, in this embodiment the polymer is used to prepare a battery wherein a single, continuous, covalently cross-linked polymer film contains an anodic region, a cathodic region, and an electrolyte region disposed there between. Such a battery is advantageous because the cross-linked polymer act as a continuous matrix or network for the composite anode, separator and composite cathode regions, such that essentially no macro-scale interfaces exist between them. Such a structure is quite unlike conventional batteries, wherein the anode, separator or electrolyte and cathode are individual layers laminated or in some other way bound together on a macro-scale, such that large or macro-scale interfaces are present between these separate and distinct entities. A gradient battery is a significant improvement over, for example, common battery structures wherein the anode and cathode have polymeric binders which differ from the electrolyte material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the present invention is directed to a process for preparing such polymer electrolytes. In particular, the present invention is directed a polymer electrolyte, and a method for the preparation thereof, wherein linear or branched polyalkylamines (e.g., poly(ethylenimine)) are cross-linked in solution, with or without ions (e.g., metal ions or protons) or a plasticizer present, in order to maintain disorder in the solid state upon the evaporation of at least a portion of the solvent. Such a process yields a less crystalline or non-crystalline polymer electrolyte matrix, thus improving the physical properties thereof for its intended use. As noted, such a process is well-suited for, among other things, a battery having a continuous electrolyte phase (i.e., a gradient battery). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As noted, the polymer electrolyte of the present invention has a polymer backbone which comprises amine groups (i.e., imino groups, or groups wherein a nitrogen atom is present, attached to which is typically a hydrogen or a hydrocarbylene (e.g., an alkylene or arylene) group, as further described herein). More specifically, the polymer comprises a repeat unit generally represented by formula (1):

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, as indicated above, the nitrogen atom may be attached to a cross-linker, L, a substituent, R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, or both, or alternatively multiple substituents (e.g., when n&equals;2). It will therefore be understood that, in some embodiments, the repeat unit of the polymer backbone may have different compositions, depending upon which segment is being referenced or described (e.g., differently substituted nitrogen atoms may be scattered randomly throughout the polymer backbone, or similarly-substituted nitrogen atoms may appear in sequence over some length or segment of the polymer backbone). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is to be further noted that while typically cross-linking within the polymer involves the amine group nitrogen atoms, cross-linking may additionally or alternatively occur at other sites within the polymer, as further described herein. Accordingly, it is to be understood that cross-linking within the polymers of the present invention may be other than herein described without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The polymers of the present invention may be linear or branched. More specifically, the amine groups or repeat units may be arranged linearly, such as for example in the case of a polymer having the general formula (2):

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> where one or more amine group nitrogens in the polymer chain or backbone at which branching occurs, rather than being bound or attached to a substituent, R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, or a cross-linker, L, is bound to another amine repeat unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that while typically a nitrogen atom is not bound to another nitrogen atom in the polymer, to form an extended chain (e.g., more than about 2) of nitrogen atoms, in some embodiments two nitrogen atoms may be bound together, such as in the case of a hydrazine derivative being present in the polymer backbone, at a branching site, or a site where substitution or cross-linking occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The polymers of the present invention comprise amine groups or repeat units which are typically spaced apart to some degree by a group X. Generally speaking, X represents the non-nitrogen portion of a monomer used to form the polymer, such as the alkyl portion of a poly(alkylamine) (e.g., the ethylene portion of poly(ethylenimine), &ldquo;PEI&rdquo;, or the propylene portion of poly(propylenimine), &ldquo;PPI&rdquo;, generally represented by repeat units (4) and (5), respectively, wherein R<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>through R<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>may be the same or different, each being generally defined the same as R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>herein).

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, or additionally, X may represent the non-nitrogen portion of a repeat unit of one or more additional amine-containing monomers; that is, in some embodiments, the polymer of the present invention may be a copolymer formed by means of polymerizing two different amine group-containing monomers, such as in the case of a polymer formed from poly(ethylenimine) and poly(propylenimine), X thus representing both the ethylene and propylene portions of the two repeat units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is to be understood that X may be essentially anything known in the art, or which may be identified by routine experimentation, that enables a polymer electrolyte to be obtained that is suitable for purposes of the present invention; that is, X may be essentially anything which enables a polymer to be obtained having the desired combination of conductivity and mechanical properties for the particular application of interest. Typically, however, X represents one or more hydrocarbylene or heterohydrocarbylene moieties (as further defined herein) on the polymer backbone, which may be the same or different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> With respect to copolymers, it is to additionally be noted that the polymer of the present invention may be a copolymer wherein an amine group-containing monomer is copolymerized with a non-amine group-containing monomer, the polymer thus having, for example, a backbone generally represented by the formula (6):

</chemistry-cwu>
</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that while formula (6) generally represents a block copolymer, essentially any type of copolymer known to those of skill in the art (e.g., random, graft), or which may be identified by routine experimentation, may be employed in the present invention. Furthermore, it is to be understood that Y may be essentially anything known in the art, or which may be identified by routine experimentation, that enables a polymer electrolyte to be obtained that is suitable for purposes of the present invention; that is, Y may be essentially anything which enables a polymer to be obtained having the desired combination of conductivity and mechanical properties for the particular application of interest. Suitable examples of Y include represents one or more hydrocarbylene or heterohydrocarbylene moieties (as further defined herein, and including those referenced above) in the polymer backbone, which may be the same or different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The relative density of the amine groups, or the number of atoms which separates one amine group from another, may vary, the desired configuration being at least in part dependent upon the given composition of the polymer itself (i.e., whether the polymer backbone comprises only hydrocarbylene and amine repeat units, whether the polymer backbone is substituted or unsubstituted and, if substituted, what the substituents are) as well as the particular application of interest (i.e., whether the resulting polymer will be swollen with a solvent, as further described herein). In those cases wherein essentially only the amine groups of the polymer chain or backbone participate in conductivity or transport, preferably these units are separated by about 1 to about 4, and more preferably about 2 to about 3, atoms in the polymer backbone. Without being held to a particular theory, it is generally believed that, in those applications wherein the polymer is swollen with a solvent, it is desirable for the nitrogens to be spatially proximate, such that conductivity is optimized, while preventing them from becoming too tightly packed. This spatial arrangement is particularly preferred for swollen systems because, depending upon the particular solvent employed, some degree of favorable hydrogen bonding, or other alternative interaction (e.g., dipole-dipole, dipole-induced dipole, or Van der Waals), may occur between the solvent and the nitrogen atoms which promote conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted, however, that the above range of &ldquo;separating atoms&rdquo; may change as other sites in the polymer backbone, in the substituent or, when present, in the cross-linker, are introduced into the polymer which may act as sites for: (a) protonation (such as in the case of proton transfer applications), (b) tethering or attachment of solvent moieties (such as in the case of dry electrolyte applications), or (c) ion transport (such as in the case of lithium battery applications). Without being held to a particular theory, it is generally believed that as the number of these additional sites increases, the distance between amine groups may also increase. Common examples of such alternative sites include other heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, sulfur, etc.), as well as aromatic structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is to be further noted that, in some embodiments, the intervening units which act to separate the amine groups (i.e., X or Y) are preferably heterohydrocarbylene; that is, in some embodiments it is preferable to have repeat units separating the amine units which contain one or more heteroatoms in the polymer chain. Particularly preferred &ldquo;spacers&rdquo; include, for example, alkylene oxides (e.g., ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, etc.) and alkylene sulfides (e.g., ethylene sulfide, propylene sulfide, etc.), among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It is to be still further noted that, in view of the spacing considerations described above (i.e., the distance between amine groups), when copolymers are formed, in at least some embodiments random copolymers or graft copolymers are preferred over block copolymers, particularly copolymers having a block which does not contain amine groups, or more specifically a block which is not conductive. (Block copolymers wherein the non-amine group containing block comprises another conductive polymer, such as block-PEO-block-PEI, may be desirable in some instances.) It is believed that the presence of a polymer block which does not contain amine groups may decrease conductivity of the copolymer, particularly if this block is long or regular enough to allow for crystallization, especially with a salt present. However, block copolymers possessing non-conducting blocks may be of interest, for example, if phase separation forms well-connected, highly conducting domains or if domains of the non-conducting blocks offer some enhancement of mechanical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Substituents </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The nitrogen atoms of the amine groups may be substituted or unsubstituted and, if substituted, the substituent may be the same or different; that is, the polymer backbone may be formed from a single amine-containing monomer or a mixture of different amine-containing monomers. When substituted, the substituent may be a side group, R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, attached to the polymer backbone or it may be a cross-linking group, L. R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>represents one or more substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl or heterohydrocarbyl, as further described herein. However, it is to be noted that while the substituent(s) may be essentially anything, both the composition of the substituent(s), as well as the degree of substitution, are to be controlled so as to optimize conductivity and those mechanical properties of interest. For example, the composition of the substituent(s), as well as the degree of substitution, are to be controlled so as to prevent crystallization from occurring, which will detrimentally impact both conductivity as well as elasticity or flexibility of the polymer electrolyte. Local crystallization can occur, for example, in those regions of the polymer where the substituent becomes too long or large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it is to be noted that, in some embodiments, substituents are preferably selected to promote the overall conductivity and/or mechanical performance of the polymer. For example, conductivity of some polymer compositions may be increased by the use of aryl, heteroaryl, heterohydrocarbyl (such as heteroalkyl), as well as ionic substituents; that is, generally any substituent, or alternatively the solvent used to swell the polymer, that will weakly interact with, and promote the mobility of, the ion (e.g., a metal ion or proton) present may be used to increase the overall conductivity of the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Cross-Linking </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As previously noted, when substituted, the substituent may be a side group R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>attached to the polymer backbone or it may be a cross-linking group L, attaching one or more of the amine group nitrogens of one polymer chain to a site in another polymer chain, which typically is an amine group nitrogen in another polymer chain; that is, cross-linking may occur between amine groups in different polymer chains, or between an amine group and some other group in a different polymer chain. Generally speaking, cross-linking is preferred in at least some embodiments of the present invention because, without being held to a particular theory, it is believed to impart favorable electrical and mechanical properties to the resulting polymer electrolyte; that is, when controlled, cross-linking is believed to have a desirable impact on both conductivity as well as the elastic properties of the electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The precise degree of cross-linking will vary, at least in part dependent upon the particular make-up of the polymer itself as well as the desired electrical and/or mechanical (or more specifically the dilatometric) properties. For example, generally speaking, as the degree of branching within a given polymer increases, the degree of cross-linking needed to achieve the desired result decreases. With respect to the desired electrical properties, it may generally be stated that the degree of cross-linking is typically (i) sufficiently high, such that crystallization of the amine group-containing segment is sufficiently suppressed (i.e., to ensure this segment is sufficiently amorphous, such that ionic conductivity is not retarded), and (ii) sufficiently low, such that segmental motion can occur, and such that not all of the ion coordination sites are occupied. Stated another way, with respect to the desired mechanical properties, cross-linking will generally be controlled such that the resulting polymer remains within the realm of elastomers; that is, the degree of cross-linking is generally controlled such that, on the lower end, the polymer will not flow (i.e., the polymer is spatially or dimensionally stable, such that it will not flow out of the container it is in), while on the upper end, the polymer is not so stiff as to be unable to stretch or expand within a given application so as to maintain essentially complete and continuous contact between electrodes (i.e., the polymer is not so cross-linked that it becomes hard/inflexible, such that upon use it becomes brittle/frayable). Such limitations are common among electrolytes currently employed in the art and are specifically overcome by the electrolytes of the present invention. Typically, however, the degree of cross-linking will be controlled so as to reach the point at which an infinite network is formed, ranging from about 1%, 5%, 10% or even 15% to less than about 100%, and in some embodiments ranging from about 20% to about 90%, from about 30% to about 80%, from about 40% to about 70%, or even from about 50% to about 60%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In this regard it is to be noted that, in addition to performance of the electrolyte, the degree of cross-linking is also an important manufacturing consideration. More specifically, in addition to the control of cross-linking to ensure the electrolyte meets desired performance criteria, cross-linking is also controlled to ensure the electrolyte may be easily handled for purposes of commercial fabrication of the end-product in which it is contained. For example, in battery applications, the ability to extrude or form very thin, flexible films is desirable. Accordingly, in some embodiments the degree of cross-linking may be less than about 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10% or even 5%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It is to be further noted that while in some embodiments typically substantially all cross-linking occurs between amine groups of one polymer chain and amine groups of another (i.e., at least about 50%, 65%, 75%, 85%, 95% or more of the cross-links are formed between amine groups), in some embodiments cross-linking may occur between other sites in the polymer chain, depending upon the composition of the polymer. For example, depending upon the particular composition of the polymer backbone, as well as substituents attached thereto, the particular cross-linker employed, and/or the method of cross-linking (e.g., irradiation, condensation, etc.), cross-linking may also or alternatively occur between (i) the nitrogen of the amine group and a different position on the backbone (i.e., main chain or a branch) of another polymer chain, (ii) the nitrogen of the amine group and a substituent, (iii) between two substituents, (iv) between two sites in different polymer chains other than the nitrogen atoms of the amine groups (as further described herein below). However, in those instances wherein cross-linking occurs only between amine group nitrogens in the polymer, or between an amine group nitrogen and some other atom in the polymer, the degree of cross-linking will typically be controlled such that the ratio of primary to secondary, secondary to tertiary or tertiary to quaternary nitrogen atoms ranges from about 25:1 to about 5:1 (i.e., about 4% to about 20% tertiary nitrogens present in the polymer), or even from about 20:1 to about 10:1 (i.e., about 5% to about 10% tertiary nitrogens present in the polymer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, in one embodiment essentially any cross-linking agent, or combination of cross-linking agents, known in the art to be suitable for amine-containing polymers or polymerizations may be employed in the present invention. More specifically, in principle, essentially any multi-functional molecule that will react with, for example, secondary or tertiary amine functionalities to form covalent bonds (e.g., anhydrides, bisanhydrides, bisMichael-type acceptors and diesters) may be suitable as cross-linkers for poly(amine) species for certain ion transport applications, depending upon the exact use conditions. Accordingly, L typically represents one or more linkers independently selected from the group consisting of substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbylene or heterohydrocarblyene, as further described herein. For example, L could be a derived from crosslinkers such as dihalocarbonyl or dihaloalkyl compounds, dihaloalkyl ethers or thio ethers, or &agr;,&bgr;-unsaturated carbonyl (e.g., aldehyde or ketone) compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted, however, that selection of the cross-linker or cross-linkers will at least in part be dictated by the application of interest. More specifically, while generally any multi-functional molecule that will react with, for example, a secondary or tertiary amine site to form a covalent bond could be used as a cross-linker, preferably a cross-linker will be selected to yield a resulting functional group that is inert to, or even acts to enhance, the ion transport application for which the material will be used. For example, in lithium anode systems, both the base polymer and the cross-linker functionality are preferably not reduced by the lithium. Difunctional alkyl and alkylarenes that have two or more leaving groups that allow nucleophilic substitution reactions to take place with the nucleophilic nitrogen atoms (e.g., 1,3-dibromopropane; 1,3-diiodohexane; 1,6-dibromohexane; 1,2-dichloroethane; di(bromomethyl)benzenes;1,7-heptanediol ditosylate, etc.) will produce cross-linked networks. In the case of PEI, for example, these cross-linkers produce tertiary ammonium functional groups with acidic protons that could be reduced by the lithium (producing flammable hydrogen gas), and potentially &ldquo;kill&rdquo; the system. However, these sites can be neutralized by treatment with base to form suitably inert tertiary amine sites. On the other hand, reaction of these cross-linkers with N-alkylpolyamines (e.g., poly(N-methylethylenimine), or PMEI) would produce quaternary ammonium functional groups which would be largely inert to the lithium and neutralization would not be needed. Either type of polymer (e.g., amine or alkylamine)/cross-linker, however, may be suitable for the so-called &ldquo;rocking chair&rdquo; type of system, wherein only lithium ions move and thus there is no metallic lithium, provided in this latter case that the system does not interact detrimentally with either the cathode or the anode to degrade performance either physically (e.g., cause delamination) or chemically (e.g., cause passivation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the case of proton transfer or conducting applications or systems, such as in fuel cells, either type of polymer (e.g., amine or alkylamine)/cross-linker system may be suitable (because typically labile protons will be present and/or added anyway). However, for such applications or systems, the covalent cross-link formed is preferably not hydrolyzed or cleaved under use conditions (e.g., strongly acidic/aqueous environment). For example, the above-described dihaloalkyl systems would generally yield cross-links capable of withstanding such use conditions. Cross-linkers for the poly(amine) systems, such as diacid chlorides and diisocyanates, among others, however would be susceptible to acid hydrolysis, the mechanical properties therefore being degraded under use conditions. Diepoxides, on the other hand, may be suitable cross-linkers, if elimination of the resulting alcohol functional cross-linkers under strongly acidic conditions does not lead to degradation of the covalent link (which is likely the case, elimination to form a carbon-carbon unsaturated bond and water typically occurring, which is generally not of concern). A somewhat unusual cross-linker involves reaction of a poly(amine) system with a &bgr;-dicarbonyl species, such as malonaldehyde. Although the cross-linking reaction initially leads to a &bgr;-diimine cross-link, which is susceptible to acid hydrolysis, an acid-catalyzed rearrangement to a &bgr;-iminoenamine cross-link occurs, which is considered to be quite stable to strongly acidic conditions. Thus, cross-linked gels can be formed by taking appropriately concentrated aqueous solutions of PEI salts (e.g., PEI hydrochloride) at room temperature and adding malonaldehyde bis(dimethylacetal), for example. Acids, such as 85% phosphoric acid, may be added to the solutions to accelerate the reaction and provide a highly acidic gel medium after evaporation of water. In principle, other &bgr;-dicarbonyl compounds or suitable precursors could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Alternative Approach to Cross-Linking </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, in an alternative to the cross-linking embodiments described above, unsaturated bonds can also be incorporated into the polymer backbone to provide potentially alternative sites for cross-linking, using for example standard vulcanization techniques (e.g., sulfur or peroxide based cross-linking). Unsaturated bonds could also be incorporated into side chains off the polymer backbone during the synthesis process or by modification, partial or complete, of the amine groups with unsaturated functional groups (e.g., by reaction with allyl chloride or acryloyl chloride). Other reactive functional groups could also be incorporated as side chains off the polymer backbone during the synthesis process or by modification, partial or complete, of the amine groups with moieties containing the reactive functionality. An example of the latter may be Michael reaction of PEI with acrylonitrile to modify the amine functionalities with &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CN side chains. The nitrile functionalities could be thermally trimerized in the presence of acids to form triazine cross-links. As is known to one skilled in the art, literally any molecule that reacts with the amine functionality and leaves another reactive functional group available for cross-linking could be used. Another example may be reaction with acrylate esters to form &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>COOR groups pendant to the amine groups. The ester groups could then be cross-linked by reaction with primary diamines to form diamide cross-links. Many other possibilities exist; for example, there is the possibility of cross-linking the poly(amine) chains directly by radiation or free radical H-abstraction techniques (e.g., peroxides or azo cross-linkers). However, such techniques are typically not preferred in most embodiments because they tend to be more costly and complicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Electrolyte Preparation/Composition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the polymers, from which the polymer electrolytes of the present invention are obtained, may be prepared by any means known in the art. For example, in a first embodiment the present invention is directed to a covalently cross-linked polymer electrolyte, the polymer comprising amine groups and a dissolved or dispersed metal salt. Common examples of suitable polymers include cross-linked, linear or branched polyalkylamines (e.g., poly(ethylenimine)), which may be used alone or as part of a larger copolymer structure. Although some linear polyalkylamines, such as linear PEI, are available commercially, due to their relatively low molecular weights (e.g., less than about 1,000), higher molecular weights may be prepared for purposes of the present invention by, for example, a known process wherein a ring-opening polymerization reaction is performed using the corresponding 2-alkyloxazoline, to obtain the polymeric amide. The polymeric amide can then be hydrolyzed to obtain the desired polyalkylamine. More specific preparations include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> 1. Linear PEI: Linear poly(N-acetyl ethylene imine) is first prepared by the methyliodide-initiated ring-opening polymerization of 2-methyloxazoline in a dimethyl formamide solution, the resulting linear poly(N-acetyl ethylene imine) then being hydrolyzed (in, for example, a sodium hydroxide solution at about 100&deg; C.) to form linear PEI (see, e.g., T. Saegusa et al., <highlight><italic>Polymer J., </italic></highlight>3, 35 (1972) or <highlight><italic>Macromol., </italic></highlight>5,108 (1972)). Alternatively, linear PEI can be prepared from poly(2-ethyloxazoline), which is commercially available in a wide range of molecular weights (e.g., 50,000; 200,000; 500,000; from Aldrich Chemical Co.), by means of acid hydrolysis to obtain the hydrochloride salt (which can be used directly with certain cross-linkers to form proton-conducting materials), followed by neutralization. (See, also, R. Tanaka et al., <highlight><italic>Macromol., </italic></highlight>16, 849 (1983), for an additional method of preparing linear PEI). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> 2. Linear PPI: Linear PPI, or poly(propylenimine), also referred to as poly(trimethylenimine), can be prepared using a similar ring-opening reaction, wherein 5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-oxazine is opened to obtain the corresponding polyamide, having a repeat unit, &mdash;&lsqb;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>N(CHO)&rsqb;&mdash;, which is then hydrolyzed to yield the final product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Branched polyalkylamines (e.g., branched PEI) are more readily available commercially in comparatively larger molecular weights. For example, branched PEI can be obtained directly from commercial sources (see, e.g., Aldrich Chemical Co.), typically having a ratio of 1:2:1 of primary:secondary:tertiary amines with branching sites about every 3 to 3.5 nitrogen atoms, in various molecular weights (e.g., 1,000; 10,000; 50,000). However, these too may be prepared by a ring opening pathway, wherein for example aziridine, or one of the various homologs or analogs thereof, is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the polymers of the present invention may be prepared by means other than herein described without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, in addition to the methods described above, polymers suitable for use in the preparation of the present polymer may be prepared using common free radical polymerization techniques with known monomers having carbon-carbon unsaturated bonds. Additionally, it is to be noted that the polymers of the present invention can be homopolymers, or copolymers prepared from two or more different monomers. The copolymers, in turn, can be random copolymers, block copolymers or graft copolymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It is to be further noted that the molecular weight (i.e., the number average molecular weight, M<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) of the polymers to be used is an important factor to consider, in that a lesser degree of cross-linking a given polymer is typically needed for higher molecular weights in order to achieve the same or similar mechanical properties, relative to that polymer&apos;s lower molecular weight counterpart. For example, as the molecular weight increases, less cross-linking is necessary in order to form a gel electrolyte suitable for use in, for example, battery applications. Less cross-linking, in turn, results in the formation of a polymer which is easier to work with, from a commercial manufacturing point of view. Higher molecular weights are also preferred in some instances because cross-linking efficiency is increased (fewer cross-links being needed in order to achieve, for example, an &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; network). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Additionally, while molecular weight has no substantially direct impact on conductivity, it does impact conductivity indirectly. For example, as molecular weight decreases, the degree of cross-linking preferably increases to maintain the desired mechanical properties. A higher degree of cross-linking, in turn, can make the polymer more difficult to swell (swelling, as further described herein, is typically achieved more easily when the degree of cross-linking is low because the polymer can stretch more easily). Accordingly, molecular weight will preferably be optimized for a given polymer composition in order to obtain the desired balance of conductivity and mechanical properties. Typically, however, M<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>ranges from greater than about 1,000 to about 1 million or more, while in some embodiments M<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>ranges from about 5,000 to about 750,000, from about 10,000 to about 500,000, from about 25,000 to about 250,000, or even from about 50,000 to about 100,000. In some preferred embodiments, M<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is about 20,000, 40,000, or even 80,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Covalent cross-linking can be achieved during the polymerization process, or alternatively after the polymer has been formed, using cross-linking agents known in the art. The precise quantity of cross-linking agent used, relative to the number of potential sites where cross-linking may occur, is controlled in order to achieve the desired degree of cross-linking within the polymer; that is, the quantity of cross-linking agent is adjusted in order to achieve the desired combination of mechanical properties and conductivity within the resulting polymer. For example, the ratio of molecules of cross-linker to number of polymer repeat units may range in some embodiments from about 1:5 to about 1:50, from about 1:10 to about 1:40, or from about 1:20 to about 1:30. However, it is to be noted that the precise ratio may vary with the desired application (e.g., for PEI and metal salt applications, the ratio may range from about 1:20 to about 1:40, while for proton applications the ratio may range from about 1:10 to about 1:20). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In this regard it is to be noted that, in at least some embodiments, cross-linking it preferably achieved after the polymerization process is complete, by means of dissolving the polymer in a suitable solvent and then performing a suitable cross-linking reaction. Without being held to a particular theory, it is generally believed that cross-linking &ldquo;in solution&rdquo; is advantageous because, once cross-linking is complete, the polymer chains are trapped in a very random, or &ldquo;solution-like&rdquo; state, which is believed to impart favorably mechanical properties to the polymers (e.g., flexibility, tensile strength, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> One or more metal salts may be incorporated into a polymer, in order to form an electrolyte of the present invention, by means known in the art or as further described herein. For example, the metal salt can be present during polymerization and/or cross-linking or, alternatively, the metal salt may be introduced into the cross-linked polymer subsequent to polymer preparation (such as by &ldquo;swelling&rdquo; the polymer, as further described herein below). Accordingly, it is to be understood that the manner by which the metal salt is introduced into the cross-linked polymer can be other than herein described without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Swelling </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Swelling can be achieved in different ways. For example, if the swelling agent is non-volatile, such as a plasticizer, non-volatile diluent, or acid, it may be present in the desired concentration during the cross-linking process, as long as it does not (i) interfere substantially with the cross-linking process (as in the case of, for example, the addition of phosphoric acid in a PEI system to be cross-linked by a dihalide, protonation of the nitrogens acting to retard the cross-linking reaction), or (ii) phase separate substantially during the cross-linking process. After evaporation of the volatile solvent (if any is present), the non-volatile additive will remain within the membrane; the same is true of any salts present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A second approach to swelling is to form the membranes/films without additives or salts present, and then soak the membranes in a solvent containing the additive, plasticizer, or salt or a mixture of several of these. As the polymer swells with the solvent, the various additives will also be taken into the membrane. On evaporation of the volatile solvent, if present, the non-volatile additives will remain in the membrane; in some cases, one of the additives may also act as the swelling solvent (e.g., in the case of liquid plasticisers or diluents). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The first approach is in some instances preferred over the second, because in the second approach (i) the number of operations needed to fabricate a membrane of the desired composition is increased, and (ii) the amount of each additive taken up by the membrane will be harder to control, as the method relies on either establishing an equilibrium concentration for each additive between the swelling solution and membrane or by controlling the uptake volumetrically (i.e., knowing how much the membrane will swell in a given solvent and adjusting the additive concentrations to leave the right or desired amount of additive after evaporation). However, the second approach is advantageous in that (i) in certain cases, it can be somewhat easier to keep the systems anhydrous, and (ii) many different systems could be made from a single generic &ldquo;stock&rdquo; membrane type; that is, the system could be tailored &ldquo;after the fact&rdquo; without having to make a new membrane formulation each time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In those instances wherein the metal salt is introduced into the polymer after it has been prepared, and either before or after it has been cross-linked, typically this is achieved by swelling the cross-linked or non-cross-linked polymer with a solvent containing a metal salt to form the electrolyte. This is achieved by contacting the polymer with a metal salt-containing solvent (or, alternatively, a solvent to which is then added a metal salt) for a period of time sufficient to ensure the desired concentration of metal ions in the polymer, and thus the desired conductivity of the polymer, is achieved. In preparation, the concentration of polymer in solution can vary, for example the ratio of the weight of the polymer to the volume of solution ranging from about 1:100 (g:ml) to about 1:10, or from about 1:80 to about 1:20 (e.g, values of about 1:80, 1:60, 1:40, and 1:20). Likewise, the ratio (wt:wt) of salt to polymer, and when present cross-linker to polymer, in solution can also vary, for example each ratio ranging independently from about 1:50 to about 2:1, or from about 1:25 to about 1:1 (e.g., about 1:25, 1:20, 1:15, 1:10, 1:5, 1:1 or more). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the upper and/or lower limits for polymer concentration in solution can also vary, the ratio being controlled in part in order to control the overall rate of reaction, for example the rate of cross-linking increasing as the concentration of the polymer or cross-linker in solution increases, the solvent thus acting to slow the reaction to some manageable rate. It is to be further noted that the reaction temperature and/or pressure can be changed in order to increase or decrease the rate of the reaction and/or solvent evaporation; likewise, the reaction time may also vary, typically ranging from several minutes (e.g., about 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 or more) to a few hours (e.g., about 2, 5, 10 15, 20 or more) and up to several days (e.g., 2, 4, 6 or more), the reaction time being at least in part a function of (i) the polymer molecular weight, (ii) the degree of polymer branching, (iii) the concentration of polymer in solution, (iv) the ratio of polymer to cross-linker, and/or (v) the reaction temperature and/or pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Once prepared, the concentration of metal in the polymer electrolyte is typically expressed in terms of the ratio of heteroatoms to metal ions in the swollen polymer; that is, this concentration is expressed as the ratio of heteroatoms present, regardless of the source (e.g., the polymer backbone, substituent side chains, or solvent), to metal atoms present. This range will vary depending upon, for example, the desired conductivity, the metal ion or ions employed, the composition of the polymer itself, the solvent employed, as well as the desired mechanical properties of the resulting electrolyte. Typically, however, this ratio will range, for some embodiments, from less than about 40:1 (heteroatoms to metal ions) to greater than about 2:1, from about 30:1 to about 3:1, from about 20:1 to about 4:1, or even from about 10:1 to about 5:1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this regard it is to be noted that, in most cases, if the ratio of heteroatoms to metal ions becomes too low, crystallization can occur. Therefore, preferably this ratio will be controlled so as to optimize conductivity and mechanical properties, while also controlling crystallization. However, crystallization will not occur at the same ratio for all systems, and for some systems crystallization may not occur at all. As a result, for some systems it is possible for this ratio to be less than about 2:1 (i.e., about 1:1 or less), making possible a &ldquo;polymer in salt&rdquo; condition (rather than a &ldquo;salt in polymer&rdquo; condition). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Essentially any solvent which is compatible with the polymer and in which the desired metal salt is sufficiently soluble, such that the salt may be introduced into the polymer matrix and remained dissolved or dispersed therein, may be employed; that is, essentially any solvent which has a high affinity for the polymer electrolyte, and which will solublize the metal salt of interest but not the polymer itself, may be used. A solvent having a high affinity for the polymer is desirable in order to avoid leakage of liquid from the cell containing the electrolyte during use. Leakage is a common problem with most commercially used electrolytes, which creates environmental as well as performance problems (conductivity decreasing as the electrolyte begins to dry as a result of leakage or evaporation). The present polymer electrolytes in some embodiments therefore comprise a swelling solvent which, as noted above, results in essentially no leakage or evaporation during use (i.e., less than about 5 weight percent, less than about 2 weight percent, less than about 1 weight percent, less than about 0.5 weight percent, or even less than about 0.1 weight percent of the solvent, relative to the total weight of the polymer, is lost during prolonged use). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Plasticizing solvents are particularly preferred, due to the improvement in performance which results, for example, by increasing polymer flexibility. Generally speaking, these solvents preferably have limited solubility for (non-cross-linked) polymeric binders in the anode or cathode (if present, such as in some battery applications). Suitable plasticizing solvents typically have a medium to high boiling point, typically greater than about 100&deg; C. (i.e., about 125&deg; C. to about 500&deg; C., or from about 150&deg; C. to about 250&deg; C.), which simplifies manufacturing and acts to extend shelf-life of the end product, a low vapor pressure, a high dielectric constant, a low viscosity, and are compatible with the components of the electrochemical cell of which the electrolyte is a part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In this regard it is to be noted that, in a preferred embodiment, non-cross-linking additives, such as a plasticizer, are added prior to the addition of the cross-linking agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Common examples of solvents suitable for use in the present invention include: alkyl or aryl esters (e.g., butyl, hexyl, 2-ethoxyethyl, phenyl, benzyl 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)-ethyl acetates) or diesters (e.g., dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, diphenyl oxalates, succinates, adipates, suberates, azelates, sebacates and phthalates); lactones (e.g., gamma-butyrolactone and 3-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone); alkyl or aryl carbonates (e.g., ethylene, propylene, butylene, dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, bis(2-methoxyethyl), methyl ethyl, methyl propyl, ethyl propyl, methyl isopropyl, and methyl methoxyethyl carbonates), alkyl or aryl phosphates (e.g., trimethyl, triethyl, tripropyl, tributyl, triphenyl, tritolyl and unsymmetric phophates); acrylates; amides (e.g., dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide); nitriles (e.g., benzonitrile); borates, sulfolanes (e.g., tetrahydrathiophene dioxide); sulphates; 1,2-dimethoxyethane; methyl formate; dimethylsulfoxide; methyl pyrrolidine; glymes of various repeat numbers (i.e., mono, di, tri, tetraglyme, etc.); tetraalkyl ureas; various ionic liquids; organic phosphoramides; as well as various mixtures thereof. In addition, low molecular weight polymers (e.g., polyesters, polyacrylates, polycarbonates and polyacrylonitries, among others, typically having molecular weights of less than about 5000, 1000, or even 500) may also be used. In some embodiments, preferred plasticizers include esters (e.g., 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy) ethyl acetate), diesters (e.g., dimethyl adipate and dibutyl phthalate), carbonates (e.g., propylene carbonate), phosphates, acrylates, borates, sulfolanes, sulphates and glymes. Alternatively, in other embodiments water, methanol or propanol (e.g., isopropanol) can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that swelling may be achieved for both metal ion and proton conducting applications, by various solvents known in the art and/or described herein. For example, for proton conduction applications, essentially any solvent that will swell the polymer and remain inert to the polymer under acidic conditions could be used, including water, H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(e.g., 85% solution), H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, or trifluoromethane sulfonic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Essentially any metal salt which can be dissolved or dispersed in an appropriate solvent compatible with the polymer of interest (i.e., having a high affinity and low solubility for the polymer) may be employed, for purposes of examining the conductivity of the polymer with that particular metal ion. Typically, however, salts of transition metals (e.g., Ni, Cu, Ru, Ag), alkali metals (e.g., Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) or alkaline earth metals (e.g., Mg, Ca, Sr) may be used in the present invention. Current state-of-the-art rechargeable batteries employ lithium-based salts, including for example LiPF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, LiSCN, LiAsF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, LiClO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, LiN(CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LiC(CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, LiBF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, LiCF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and LiSbF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. However, alternative metal salts, such as those based on sodium (e.g., NaSCN) or Ca, or Cu (e.g., copper(II)chloride) may also be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In preparation, the concentration of metal salt in the swelling solvent may vary, depending upon for example the polymer electrolyte composition, the solvent or combination of solvents to be employed, and the desired concentration of solvent and/or salt in the polymer to be achieved. Typically, the concentration of the metal salt in the swelling solvent ranges from a few weight percent (relative to the total weight of the solution), up to about the saturation limit of the metal salt in the solvent or combination of solvents being used. In some embodiments, however, the salt concentration ranges from about 0.1 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, from about 0.2 weight percent to about 8 weight percent, from about 0.4 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, from about 0.8 weight percent to about 4 weight percent, or even from about 1 weight percent to about 2 weight percent, relative to the total weight of the solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Although the final concentration of the metal salt and/or the swelling solvent in the polymer electrolyte will vary, once the swelling process is completed, the concentration of solvent in the electrolyte will, in some embodiments, range from a few weight percent (e.g., about 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or more weight percent), based on the total weight of the electrolyte, to several tens of weight percent (e.g., about 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 or more). Typically, however, this concentration will be less than about 50 weight percent, less than about 25 weight percent, less than about 10 weight percent, less than about 5 weight percent, or even less than about 1 weight percent, relative to the total weight of the swollen polymer electrolyte. In addition, the salt concentration typically ranges from about 1 weight percent to about 20 weight percent, from about 2 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, from about 4 weight percent to about 12 weight percent, or even from about 6 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, relative to the total weight of the swollen polymer electrolyte. Again, however, in other embodiments, this concentration may be greater than 20 weight percent (e.g., 30, 40, 50 weight percent or more). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In this regard it is to be noted that, in those embodiments wherein a swelling solvent is not used (such as, for example, when a solvent moiety is present in the polymer, as described herein), the concentration of metal salt in the polymer electrolyte may be other than described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Dry&rdquo; Polymer Electrolytes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In addition to those embodiments of the present invention wherein the polymer electrolytes are swollen with a metal salt-containing solvent, polymer electrolytes of the present invention may alternatively be used for the same or similar purposes without the need of a swelling solvent. More specifically, metal salts may be incorporated into these polymers, and maintained in a dissolved or dispersed state therein, without the need of a swelling solvent by means of, for example, the inclusion of a &ldquo;solvent moiety&rdquo; in the polymer. The solvent moiety may be included in the polymer by tethering (i.e., covalently bonding) the moiety to the finished polymer (backbone, side chain or substituent) or, alternatively, to the monomer prior to polymer synthesis. In some embodiments, a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; polymer electrolyte is formed because, as a result of these moieties, no solvent is needed to enable the metal salt to remain in a dissolved or dispersed state within the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;solvent moiety&rdquo; refers to a solvent molecule, or a portion thereof (i.e., a solvent residue), which has been covalently bound to the polymer and which acts to enable a metal salt to be solublized or dispersed within the polymer. However, it is to be noted that this may simply be viewed as a modification of monomer or polymer itself (thus providing a new monomer or polymer composition). Regardless of the manner in which it is viewed, referring again to formula (1), it is to be noted that in this embodiment, in some cases R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>may additionally or alternatively represent a solvent moiety (in those instances wherein the solvent moiety is bound to a nitrogen of an amine group), as well as a non-solubilizing substituent. Suitable solvents from which the solvent moiety may be derived include essentially any solvent suitable for use as a swelling solvent, as described herein. Alternatively, the solvent moiety may be, for example, heteroakyl (e.g., alkoxy, such as &mdash;O(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O)<highlight><subscript>b</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, where b ranges from 1 to about 6, or from about 2 to about 4). Particularly preferred &ldquo;moieties&rdquo; are those derived from solvents which act as a plasticizer for the polymer and which interact with ions dissolved or dispersed in the polymer matrix (e.g., glymes, such as poly(N-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl)ethylenimine, wherein an alkoxy substituent is tethered to the nitrogen atom); other ether linkage-containing moieties, such as THF; amide functional solvents, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone; dimethylsulfoxide; sulfolane; nitriles, such as acetonitrile; and, carbonates, such a propylene carbonate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As a result of the fact that the solvent (in the form of the solvent moiety) is now a part of the polymer itself, rather than simply being adsorbed therein, many of the limitations or problems common in conventional systems using swollen electrolytes are eliminated. For example, leakage and/or evaporation are essentially no longer a problem because a liquid solvent is not needed for purposes of maintaining the metal salt in the polymer. Stated another way, in swollen systems, the solvent is used for purposes of dissolving the metal salt and maintaining the salt in a dissolved or dispersed state within the polymer electrolyte. However, in the present embodiment, it is the bound solvent moieties which act to ensure the salt, once introduced, remains dissolved or dispersed within or throughout the polymer electrolyte. As a result, a swelling solvent is typically unnecessary for purposes of achieving a final product; that is, while a solvent may be used to &ldquo;swell&rdquo; the polymer, in order to introduce the metal salt into the polymer, this solvent may subsequently be removed (by, for example, evaporation), leaving behind the metal salt in a dissolved or dispersed state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, in those instances wherein only the solvent moiety is to be responsible for maintaining dissolution or dispersion of the metal salt in the polymer electrolyte, the number of solvent moieties present in the polymer is preferably sufficient to ensure a concentration of metal salt within the polymer which is high enough to achieve the desire conductivity, while still maintaining the necessary mechanical properties; that is, the number of solvent moieties present in the polymer is preferably optimized in order to achieve the highest performance of the polymer electrolyte, in terms of both conductivity and mechanical stability. For example, the ratio of solvent &ldquo;moieties&rdquo; to polymer repeat units may range, in some instances, from about 1:40 to greater than about 1:1 (e.g., about 1:30, 1:20, 1:10, 1:8, 1:6, 1:4, 1:2); that is, this ratio may range from about 1:40 to about 1:1, from about 1:30 to about 1:2, from about 1:20 to about 1:4, or even from about 1:10 to about 1:6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> However, while a high concentration of solvent moieties is desirable for purposes of maximizing metal salt concentration, the impact this has on the degree of cross-linking is to be considered. This is because the solvent moiety concentration, in turn, impacts the mechanical performance of the polymer. More specifically, in those instances wherein cross-linking and solvent moiety attachment can only occur at the nitrogen of the amine groups, a tradeoff may exists between solvent moiety concentration and degree of cross-linking. As a result, in some embodiments preferably both the solvent moiety concentration and the degree of cross-linking are optimized to achieve the desired combination of conductive and mechanical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> With regard to the &ldquo;trade-off&rdquo; between solvent moiety concentration and cross-linking, it is to be noted, however, that there are exceptions. For example, in the case of cyanoalkylated (e.g., cyanoethylated) LPEI, near complete substitution does not appear to hinder cross-linking. Additionally, in the case of tertiary amines, cross-linking is still possible with the proper cross-linker (e.g., dihalides but not bis-acetals). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> It is to be further that, in cases wherein solvent moiety attachment and cross-linking occurs at the same nitrogen, the formation of an ammonium salt results. Although this can be a complication in some instances, the complication may be alleviated by the introduction of a substituent on the monomer which acts as an alternative site for (i) solvent moiety tethering, and/or (ii) cross-linking. Alternatively, the solvent moiety could, for example, be built into the cross-linker, such that cross-linking and introduction of the solvent moiety occurs at the same time by the use of a single compound. However, in a preferred embodiment, the nitrogens of the amine groups have only hydrogens, solvent moieties or cross-linkers attached thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Typically, incorporation of the solvent moiety into the final polymer electrolyte composition is achieved by chemically modifying the monomers used prior to the polymerization reaction. Alternatively, however, in some embodiments the solvent moieties may be tethered, grafted or bound to the polymer backbone after polymerization has been completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The preparation of such polymer electrolytes may be achieved by means known in the art. For example, alkylation can occur at these sites by treating the polymer with an aldehyde or carboxylic acid under appropriate conditions in the presence of a reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride. More specifically, propionitrile moieties can be attached, for example, to a portion of the nitrogen atoms by conjugate addition with acrylonitrile in refluxing methanol. Such an approach can be used to modify, for example, 50%, 75%, 95% or more of the nitrogen atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Proton Transport </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the polymers of the present invention may be utilized as electrolytes for applications (e.g., fuel cells) involving proton transport or conductance. The present polymers are particularly well-suited for such applications because, due to the presence of the amine groups within the polymer, they possess the inherent ability to form labile protons. Stated another way, because the amine group nitrogens may form primary, secondary, or tertiary ammonium salts (as a result of, for example, polymerization, substitution, cross-linking, etc. at the nitrogen atoms), the polymers may in some instances be inherently protonated (i.e., protons are inherently present within the polymers, not being introduced by means of the addition of a protic solvent for example). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Although a polymer of the present invention may or may not have some inherent degree of proton conductivity once prepared, in general proton conductivity may be further enhanced, or imparted, by the introduction of additional protons. As described above with respect to the metal salt containing polymers, the introduction of protons may be achieved during the polymerization process or, alternatively, after the polymerization process has been completed. Generally speaking, the concentration of protons in the polymer is increased by introducing a protic solvent into it; that is, the polymer may in some embodiments be &ldquo;swollen&rdquo; with a protic solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Regardless of the manner by which protons are introduced into the polymer, typically a concentration of protons will be introduced which is sufficient to achieve a desirable level of conductivity. Generally speaking, the desired concentration of protons may be expressed relative to the number of protonation sites in the polymer itself. For example, when the polymer is comprised only of saturated carbon-hydrogen, carbon-nitrogen and/or nitrogen-hydrogen bonds (e.g., the case of PEI or PPI), essentially only the lone pair of electrons on each nitrogen atom may act as a site for protonation. In this case, the ratio of protons to nitrogen atoms is typically greater than zero and less than about 1 (e.g., about 0.2:1, 0.4:1, 0.6:1, or even 0.8:1); that is, in order for there to be proton mobility within the polymer electrolyte, the polymer electrolyte is typically not fully protonated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted in this regard that as the composition of the polymer changes and other potential sites for protonation are introduced (for example, other heteroatoms in the backbone, side chains or linkers), the ratio of protons to nitrogen atoms may be other than herein described. However, in such instances, the relative limits on proton concentration still apply; that is, when other potential sites of protonation are present, the relative ratio of protons to all protonation sites is still typically greater than zero and less than about 1. However, it is to be further noted that while typically a polymer electrolyte is not fully protonated, full protonation may be possible in some embodiments. More specifically, although a fully protonated electrolyte is not typically preferred, in some embodiments such a system may be desirable. For example, depending upon the particular protic solvent employed for swelling (e.g., phosphoric acid), an acceptable conductivity may be achieved under fully protonated conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, essentially any solvent which will generate protons in the presence of the polymer electrolyte, and thus impart conductivity thereto, may be used. As with the solvents employed in the metal salt application above, these protic solvents preferably have a high affinity for the polymer composition, in order to significantly limit, and preferably avoid, leakage and evaporation (i.e., less than about 5 weight percent, less than about 2 weight percent, less than about 1 weight percent, less than about 0.5 weight percent, or even less than about 0.1 weight percent of the solvent, relative to the total weight of the polymer, is lost during prolonged use). In addition, such solvents preferably have a high boiling point (i.e., typically greater than about 100&deg; C.), a low vapor pressure, a high dielectric constant, a low viscosity, low solubility for the polymer electrolyte itself, and are compatible with the components of the electrochemical cell of which the electrolyte is a part. Common solvents for some applications include, for example, water, triflic acid, acetic acid, and phosphoric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In preparation, the concentration of polymer in solution can vary, for example the ratio of the weight of the polymer to the volume of solution ranging from about 1:100 (g:ml) to about 1:10, or from about 1:80 to about 1:20 (e.g, values of about 1:80, 1:60, 1:40, and 1:20). Likewise, the ratio (wt:wt) of cross-linker to polymer in solution can also vary, for example ranging from about 1:20 to about 2:1, or from about 1:15 to about 1:1 (e.g., about 1:15, 1:10, 1:5, 1:1 or more). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the upper and/or lower limits for polymer concentration in solution can also vary, the ratio being controlled in part in order to control the overall rate of reaction, for example the rate of cross-linking increasing as the concentration of the polymer or cross-linker in solution increases, the solvent thus acting to slow the reaction to some manageable rate. It is to be further noted that the reaction temperature and/or pressure can be changed in order to increase or decrease the rate of the reaction and/or solvent evaporation; likewise, the reaction time may also vary, typically ranging from several minutes (e.g., about 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 or more) to a few hours (e.g., about 2, 5, 10 15, 20 or more) and up to several days (e.g., 2, 4, 6 or more), the reaction time being at least in part a function of (i) the polymer molecular weight, (ii) the degree of polymer branching, (iii) pH, (iv) the concentration of polymer in solution, (v) the ratio of polymer to cross-linker, and/or (vi) the reaction temperature and/or pressure. Finally, it is to be noted that, as further described herein, other, non-cross-linking additives (e.g., plasticizers or external acids, such as H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) can also be added, typically before the addition of the cross-linker to the polymer solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Once prepared, although the final concentration of the protic swelling solvent in the polymer electrolyte will vary, the concentration of the solvent in the electrolyte will, in some embodiments, range from a few weight percent (e.g., about 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or more weight percent), based on the total weight of the electrolyte, to several tens of weight percent (e.g., about 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 or more). Typically, however, this concentration will be less than about 50 weight percent, less than about 25 weight percent, less than about 10 weight percent, less than about 5 weight percent, or even less than about 1 weight percent, relative to the total weight of the swollen polymer electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Additives, which act to increase proton transport or mobility, may optionally be incorporated into the polymer electrolyte during the swelling and/or polymerization process. Generally speaking, essentially any compound which would act as a &ldquo;proton shuttle,&rdquo; aiding in the movement of protons from one covalent bond in the polymer electrolyte to another, may be employed, provided it is soluble in and compatible with the polymer electrolyte system of interest. Examples of suitable additives for some applications include various amides (e.g., benzamides), amines (e.g., (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N), or ammonium salts having at least one labile proton (e.g., alkyl ammonium salts, such as (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>NH<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>). In this regard it is to be noted that one skilled in the art would recognize that the precise form of, for example, the amine/ammonium salt will depend on the protonation state of the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The precise concentration of the additive within the polymer system will vary depending upon, for example, the composition of the polymer itself, the particular additive to be used, the generally solubility limit of the additive in the polymer, as well as the protic solvent (if one is to be used). Accordingly, the concentration will therefore be determined with these considerations in mind, in order to optimized the overall proton conductivity of the polymer electrolyte. Typically, however, the concentration of additive within the polymer electrolyte will range from less than about 1 weight percent (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 weight percent), to a few weight percent (e.g., about 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) or more (e.g., about 10, 15, 20, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Single Ion&rdquo; Electrolytes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that, in one embodiment of the present invention, the polymer electrolyte is prepared such that conductivity is achieved by means of a &ldquo;single ion&rdquo; source; that is, conductivity using the polymer electrolyte is achieved by the movement of only the cations or anions in the system, the corresponding counter-ions being part of the polymer itself and thus not being mobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Without being held to a particular theory, it is generally believed such a system is a significant improvement over existing &ldquo;two ion&rdquo; electrolytes because, when subjected to DC current over time, segregation of positively and negative ions occurs, each type of ion accumulating at the corresponding oppositely charged electrode. This build-up of like-charged ions near each electrode surface results in increased internal resistance, and thus decreased current output at a given potential (i.e., voltage) of a battery comprising such an electrolyte. However, this build-up occurs at both electrodes. As a result, a &ldquo;single ion&rdquo; electrolyte does not have this problem because only one type can move. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment of the present invention, the electrolyte comprises a polymer having ionic substituents (e.g., R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>) attached to the polymer backbone. These substituents may be present in the monomer, from which the polymer is prepared, or alternatively may be attached to the polymer backbone after polymerization has been completed. Essentially any substituent known to one skilled in the art may be employed, including for example alkylsulfate or alkylsulfonate salts (e.g., sodium methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc. salts), as well as aryloxides (e.g., phenoxides, such as lithium phenoxides), alkylcarboxylates and alkylphosphonates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Electrolyte Properties </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Experience to-date suggests that the present polymer electrolytes can be formed into thin, continuous films (i.e., films substantially free of chemical boundaries and ranging in thickness from, for example, about 25 to about 2000, from about 50 to about 1500, or even from about 100 to about 1000 microns). Additionally, these electrolyte films have good specific conductivity (i.e., about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>S/cm, 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>S/cm, 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>S/cm or greater, as determined by means known in the art, and also as described herein below) at temperatures ranging from about 20&deg; C. to about 100&deg; C. (i.e., about 20&deg; C., 40&deg; C., 60&deg; C., 80&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> However, in this regard it is to be noted that, because of the favorable mechanical properties and the ability to maintain conductivity at high salt concentrations (i.e., a high ion flux), the present invention advantageously allows for thin films (i.e., films having low resistivity) to be prepared and used in some lower conductivity embodiments for certain applications, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it is to be noted that these films are continuous and homogeneous, being substantially uniform in terms of composition and physical/electrical properties, while also having relatively low densities (in comparison, for example, to prior art materials formed under pressure, as referenced above). Furthermore, as noted herein, these films have been found to possess mechanical properties at common operational temperatures that are superior to, for example, existing poly(ethylene oxide)-based electrolytes, which currently predominate the field of battery technology research. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Employing means known in the art, the electrolytes of the present invention may be suitably used in a number of different electrochemical cell applications including, for example, batteries and fuel cells. The configuration of such cells is generally described below. However, it is to be understood that the configuration may be other than herein described without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Battery </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, the metal salt-containing polymer electrolytes of the present invention may be used to prepare a battery by means common in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,456,000; 5,460,904; 5,552,239; and, 5,840,087, all of which are incorporated herein by reference). Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> basic, laminated battery cell structure, which may be prepared using the polymer electrolyte of the present invention, is depicted. The battery cell structure comprises a collector foil, such as copper, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, typically in the form of open mesh grid, upon which is laid a negative electrode membrane <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which may comprise an intercalatable material such as carbon or graphite or a low-voltage insertion compound such as WO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, MoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or Al, dispersed in a polymeric binder matrix. The polymer electrolyte/separator film of the present invention, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, is positioned upon the electrode element <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is covered with a positive electrode membrane <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which may comprise a composition of a finely-divided lithium intercalation compound, such as LiMn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or LiNiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, in a polymeric binder matrix. An aluminum collector foil or grid <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> completes the assembly, which is then pressed between, for example, platens (not shown) under heat and pressure to soften and bond the polymeric components and laminate the membrane and grid layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Gradient Battery </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In addition to being used to prepare an electrolyte for use in, for example, a typically battery cell structure, the polymer of the present invention may be used to prepare a gradient battery, or a battery wherein a single, continuous electrolyte phase extends from one collector to the other. More specifically, the polymer of the present invention may be used to prepare a battery having a single, unitary cell structure (i.e., a battery wherein the anode, electrolyte and cathode are regions within a single, continuous electrolyte phase). Such a battery is advantageous for several reasons, including the fact that the cross-linked polymer act as a continuous matrix or network for the composite anode, separator and composite cathode regions, such that essentially no macro-scale interfaces exist between them. Such a structure is quite unlike conventional batteries, wherein the anode, separator or electrolyte and cathode are individual layers laminated or in some other way bound together, such that large or macro-scale interfaces are present between these separate and distinct entities. A gradient battery is also a significant improvement over, for example, common battery structures wherein the anode and cathode have polymeric binders which differ from the electrolyte material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> As is known to those of skill in the art, the large-scale interfaces which exist in these regions for current, state-of-the-art electrolytic cells is a source of problems relating to the overall conductivity and performance of such cells. More specifically, it is well-recognized that large-scale or bulk interfaces commonly serve as sites where electrical failures occurs. Accordingly, the performance of a gradient battery is improved because the interfaces present are of a significantly smaller scale. Multiple small-scale failures can occur without substantially impacting performance, thus prolonging the useful life of the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention additionally provides the means by which to prepare such a gradient battery. More specifically, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it can be seen that, generally speaking, the gradient battery comprises a continuous, covalently cross-linked polymer film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The polymer film comprises labile metal ions or protons (not shown), a negative electrode region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in which is initially dispersed an anodic material <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (e.g., an intercalatable material, such as those described above), an electrolyte region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (i.e., the polymer electrolyte of the present invention), and a positive electrode region <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in which is initially dispersed a cathodic material <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (e.g., a finely-divided lithium intercalation compound, such as those described above). Additionally, the gradient battery comprises, as in a common battery cell, current collectors <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which are in contact with the negative and positive electrode regions of the polymer film. Optionally, intervening regions (not shown) between the negative electrode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the positive electrode <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be present which contain appropriate metal ions (e.g., Cu<highlight><superscript>&plus;2 </superscript></highlight>salts), in order to facilitate the redox process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, the gradient battery may be prepared by means known to one skilled in the art. For example, such a battery can be prepared by forming a first solution comprising a polymer of the present invention and a particulate material suitable for use as an anode or cathode. More specifically, a solution comprising a polymer of the present invention, a cross-linking agent and a material (such as those described herein) which is suitable for use as an anode or cathode, preferably in particulate form, are mixed and placed in a vessel suitable for allowing a film to form or cure. A second solution, comprising a polymer electrolyte of the present invention (i.e., a solution comprising a polymer of the present invention, a cross-linking agent and metal ions) is then deposited upon the first film, or more specifically a first regioin of what will be a single, continuous film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In this regard it is to be noted that because the cross-linking reaction occurs over time, if the second solution is deposited upon the first after the first has taken form or begun to &ldquo;set up&rdquo; (i.e., after cross-linking and/or solvent evaporation has reached the point at which film formation has begun) but before the curing or cross-linking process is complete, the two solutions will form separate, distinct regions within a single, continuous film because cross-linking will occur between the solutions. More specifically, as a result of, among other things, the timing of the addition and the rate of the cross-linking reaction, the contents of the solutions (i.e., the electrode material in the first solution and the metal ions in the second) remain substantially confined within separate regions, while polymers within one region that are proximate polymers in another region are bound together as a result of the cross-linking reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Following this same process, a third solution is prepared, having a composition similar to the first, with the exception that the electrode material dispersed in the solution is suitable for use as an anode if the first solution comprised a material suitable for use as a cathode, or vice versa. As when the second solution was deposited upon the first, the third solution is deposited upon the second after the second has taken form, but before the cross-linking process has reached completion. As a result, once the curing process is complete for each of the solutions, a continuous polymer film will result which has distinct regions which act as the anode, the electrolyte/separator, and the cathode. The battery structure can then be completed by the application of current collectors to each side of the polymer film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> It is to be noted that the gradient battery may be prepared by alternative processes without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, in at least some embodiments, cross-linking is performed for purposes of controlling the diffusion or settling of the metal electrode materials. Therefore, partial cross-linking may be optional, provided the viscosity of the polymer solution is sufficient to prevent settling and/or mixing of these materials before gelation occurs (i.e., before the polymer beings to solidify). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> It is to be further noted that the process of preparing a gradient batter can be accelerated, for example, by heating (e.g., to about 50&deg; C., 75&deg; C. or more, depending upon the materials, such as the type of polymer, solvent, etc., employed). Furthermore, multiple mixtures (e.g., another mixture of Zn/branched PEI/dichloroethane cross-linker, and then Cu/branched PEI/dichloroethane cross-linker, etc.) can be used, in order to form compound batteries. Small amounts of a plasticizer can also be added in each mixture, in order to modify the physical properties of the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> It is to be still further noted that while the ratio of zinc, copper, etc. can vary in each mixture, generally speaking, the concentration will preferably be above the percolation threshold (i.e., the point at which most of the zinc or copper particles are in physical contact with each other). This threshold depends, at least in part, on the size and the shape of the particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Finally, experience to-date suggests, like the polymer electrolytes of the present invention, the gradient battery of the present invention can be formed into very thin, continuous films. Such films can range in thickness, for example, from about 50 microns to about 5000 microns, from about 100 microns to about 4000 microns, or even from about 200 microns to about 2000 microns (excluding the collectors). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The gradient batteries of the present invention possess unique mechanical properties, including for example greater flexibility, elasticity and durability, as compared to conventional batteries. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, the protonated polymer electrolytes of the present invention may also be used to prepare a fuel cell by means known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,994,426; 6,010,798; and, 5,045,934, all of which are incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the basic structure of a fuel cell, which may be prepared using the polymer electrolyte of the present invention, is depicted. The fuel cell structure comprises the polymer electrolyte membrane of the present invention <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, upon which is deposited on each side a catalyst layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which typically contains a precious metal (such as, for example, platinum), to form a membrane-electrode assembly. Diffusion layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (i.e., gas-permeable, porous, electrically conductive collectors, one acting as the anode and one as the cathode) are disposed on both sides of the membrane-electrode assembly, which act to allow a fuel gas or an oxidizing agent gas to be passed to the catalyst layers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, while also performing the function of outward delivery of an electric current. These diffusion layers are interposed between gas-impermeable separators <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to form a cell. Ribs <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and grooves <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the side of the separators facing the diffusion layers are provided, through which either fuel gas or an oxidizing agent gas may flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In operation, one side of the fuel cell is supplied with a combustible substance (e.g., gas or liquid), such as hydrogen, a hydrogen-containing gas or an alcohol (e.g., methanol), and the other side is supplied with an oxidant, such as oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas (e.g., air, carbon monoxide or nitrogen oxides (&ldquo;NO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;)). Hydrogen is oxidized at the anode, protons being produced which diffuse through the membrane to the oxygen side; in this case, water is generally entrained with them (the so-called &ldquo;drag effect&rdquo;). At the cathode, the protons recombine with reduced oxygen to form water, referred to as product water, which is removed in suitable fashion from the fuel cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Performance Tests </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Performance tests of the polymer electrolytes of the present invention were conducted by the following methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Conductivity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Conductivity of the polymer electrolytes of the present invention was measured by means known in the art. More specifically, polymer electrolyte films for conductivity measurements were formed with thicknesses ranging from about 1000 to about 1800 microns. A disk, about 13 mm in diameter, was cut from each film using a hand punch and placed in a conductivity cell. The film was then placed between two stainless steel electrodes, each with about a 12.5 mm diameter face. (Note that the actual film thickness for each sample was determined by means of a micrometer built into the conductivity cell.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Conductivity (AC current) was measured using an impendance analyzer (Hewlett Packard, Model 4192A), over a frequency range of about 50 Hz to about 10 MHZ. The potential difference used to measure the conductivity of each sample was typically about 25 mV, although in a few cases the potential difference was about 50 mV. In each case, measurements were taken at about 20&deg; C., 40&deg; C., 60&deg; C. or 80&deg; C., the temperature within the conductivity cell being controlled and measured to within &plus;/&minus;1&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Dynamic Mechanical Analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Dynamic mechanical analysis was performed by means common in the art to determine the storage modulus of one representative sample of the present invention. More specifically, a sample was prepared and tested as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> LPEI (0.91 g; average molecular weight about 86,000) was dissolved in 6 mL methanol, and then 1,6-diiodohexane (0.23 g) was added (N:I ratio about 15.7:1). The solution was thoroughly mixed and allowed to gel in a 50 mm diameter dish for about 1 day. The solvent was then allowed to evaporate. Dynamic mechanical analysis was then performed on the cross-linked sample, indicating that the room temperature storage modulus was about 30,000 psi. This modulus, or stiffness, is similar to that of low density polyethylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Solvent Retention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Experience to-date shows, for example, that a cross-linked (using a dihalide cross-linker), linear PEI swollen with N-methylpyrrolidone (about 40 weight percent), did not &ldquo;bleed&rdquo; (i.e., lose any significant amount of solvent, based on weight measurements) over a period of several days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a cross-linked (using a bisacetal cross-linker) linear PEI (hydrochloride salt) swollen with a H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>solution (about 85 weight percent) did not &ldquo;bleed&rdquo; over a period of several months (some samples having been found to exhibit little or no bleed after 4, 8, 12 months or more). (See &ldquo;Experiments&rdquo; provide below, for additional details.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;hydrocarbylene&rdquo; typically embrace moieties consisting exclusively of the elements carbon and hydrogen and which may optionally be substituted with other hydrocarbyl, halo (e.g., chlorine, fluorine, bromine) or other hetero (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) substituents. These moieties may include alkylene, alkenylene, alkynylene and arylene groups, as well as such groups substituted with other aliphatic or cyclic hydrocarbon groups such as, for example, alkaryl, alkenaryl and alkynaryl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Heterohydrocarbylene&rdquo; embrace moieties in which a carbon chain atom in the corresponding hydrocarbylene moiety has been replaced with a heteroatom, such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur (or alternatively a halogen atom). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Alkylene&rdquo; groups described herein are preferably lower alkylene, containing from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, and more preferably from about 1 to about 3 or 4 carbon atoms, in the principal chain. They may be straight or branched chains and include methylene, ethylene, propylene, isopropylene, butylene, isobutylene, pentylene, hexylene and the like. They may be substituted with aliphatic or cyclic (including aryl) hydrocarbon radicals, halogens or other heteroatoms. Similarly, one or more carbon atoms in the main chain of the substituent or moiety may be replaced with a heteroatom (such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur, or alternatively a halogen), which is sometimes referred to herein as a &ldquo;heterohydrocarbylene&rdquo; moiety. These too may be optionally substituted as described above and, like the lower alkylene analogs, preferably range from about 1 to about 6 atoms, and more preferably from about 1 to about 3 or 4 atoms, in the principal chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;hydrocarbyl&rdquo; typically embraces moieties consisting exclusively of the elements carbon and hydrogen, which may optionally be substituted with other hydrocarbyl, halo (e.g., chlorine, fluorine, bromine) or other hetero (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) substituents. These moieties include alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and aryl moieties, as well as alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and aryl moieties substituted with other aliphatic or cyclic (including aryl) hydrocarbon groups such as, for example, alkaryl, alkenaryl and alkynaryl. &ldquo;Heterohydrocarbyl&rdquo; embrace moieties in which a carbon chain atom is replaced by a heteroatom, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, or alternatively a halogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Alkyl&rdquo; groups described herein are preferably lower alkyl containing from about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms in the principal chain, and more preferably from about 1 to 3 or 4 carbon atoms in the principal chain. They may be straight or branched chains and include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the like. They may be substituted with an aliphatic or a cyclic hydrocarbon radical, a halogen or other heteroatom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Alkenyl&rdquo; groups described herein are preferably lower alkenyl containing from about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms in the principal chain. They may be straight or branched chains and include ethenyl, propenyl, isopropenyl, butenyl, isobutenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, and the like. They may be substituted with an aliphatic or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, a halogen or other heteroatom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Alkynyl&rdquo; groups described herein are preferably lower alkynyl containing from about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms in the principal chain. They may be straight or branched chain and include ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, isobutynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl, and the like. They may be substituted with an aliphatic or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, a halogen or other heteroatom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the phrase &ldquo;degree of cross-linking,&rdquo; as well as variations thereof, generally refers to the number of cross-linked sites relative to the total number of sites at which cross-linking can occur. This number can be estimated or determined by means known in the art. For example, the total number of sites at which cross-linking can occur can be calculated based on the number of monomer units reacted in the polymerization reaction, multiplied by the number of sites per monomer. The number of sites cross-linked can then be estimated based on the amount of cross-linking agent which reacted with the resulting polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;swollen,&rdquo; as well as variations thereof, generally refers to the introduction of a solvent into the polymer matrix, such that it has a larger dimension than it would otherwise have absent the solvent. The solvent may be used to introduce a salt or some other ion, to impart some physical property (e.g., a plasticizing solvent), or both (e.g., a non-volatile acid, like phosphoric acid). However, in some instances, such as in the case of a rigid network, a physical or dimensional change may be limited, due to limited mobility of the network, but a weight change will still typically be observed (due to absorption of the solvent into the void spaces of the network). It will therefore be understood that &ldquo;swelling&rdquo; may not in all instances result in a dimensional change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;labile proton&rdquo; typically refers to a proton which is mobile (in terms of conductivity) or removable (in terms of reactivity). The presence of such protons may be determined by means known in the art. &ldquo;Elastomer&rdquo; generally refers herein to the ability of the polymer electrolyte to return to its original shape after being deformed under use conditions. In some embodiments, &ldquo;elastomer&rdquo; more specifically refers to a polymer electrolyte which, after about a 5% static strain, substantially returns to its original dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The process of the present invention is further illustrated by the following Examples. These Examples are designed to teach those of ordinary skill in the art how to practice certain features of the present invention. As such, one skilled in the art will recognize that the following procedures could be employed to prepared samples using, for example, (i) different monomers (to prepare different polymers), (ii) different cross-linkers (such as &bgr;,&bgr;&prime;-dichloroethylether; 1,3-dibromopropane; 1,5-dibromopentane; 1,6-diiodohexane; &agr;,&agr;&prime;-1,2-dibromoxylene; &agr;,&agr;&prime;-1,3-dibromoxylene; &agr;,&agr;&prime;-1,4-dibromoxylene;1,4-dichloro-2-butyne; acrolein, and methylvinylketone), (iii) different salts, (iv) different solvents, (v) different ratios of polymer to cross-linker, polymer to salt, polymer to solvent, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> One of skill in the art will further recognize that the following process can be modified in order to identify optimum conditions for a given application. For example, with respect to the determination of cross-linking parameters, one skilled in the art would recognize the described procedure could be employed to for any polymer/solvent/cross-linker/additive combination or system to evaluate, for example, the effects of concentration, cross-linking time and/or temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, these Examples are not to be interpreted in a limiting sense. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> A. Preparation of LPEI </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Poly(2-ethyloxazoline) (200,000 average molecular weight, commercially available from Aldrich), 34.1 g, was dissolved with stirring and warming in 1800 mL of 3 molar aqueous HCl in a flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The solution was then heated to a gentle reflux for 5 days. The aqueous HCl (and propanoic acid which formed) were removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The resulting LPEI hydrochloride salt (which could be used directly for cross-linking in water with a bisacetal, as further described below) was dissolved in 3500 mL distilled water, and then sodium hydroxide pellets were added with heating and stirring until (i) a pH greater than 10, and (ii) a temperature greater than 70&deg; C. were achieved, in order to ensure that the LPEI was dissolved. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature, and then the resulting solid LPEI was collected by filtration using a glass Buchner funnel, initially by gravity and then by suction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The resulting solid polymer was purified by placing it in 3500 mL distilled water, heating to dissolve the polymer, and then allowing it to cool to room temperature. The polymer was isolated by filtration (as previously described). This process was repeated until the filtrate had a neutral pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The purified polymer was dried under reduced pressure at 45&deg; C. for 1 day, and then 75&deg; C. for 1 day. (11.8 g of LPEI was obtained; about 80% theoretical yield; NMR and IR spectra were in agreement with literature data; see, e.g., R. Tanaka et al., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>16, (1983) 849, which is incorporated herein by reference.) The calculated average molecular weight of the resulting LPEI, assuming no significant chain scission, was about 86,000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> B. Preparation of Salt-Containing LPEI Samples </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Lithium triflate (&ldquo;LiTf&rdquo;) and sodium triflate (&ldquo;NaTf&rdquo;) (both commercially available from Aldrich) were dried under vacuum at 120&deg; C. for 24 hours. Anhydrous methanol (commercially available from Aldrich, 99.8%, 0.002% water) was redistilled and stored over molecular sieves. All materials were stored in a nitrogen-atmosphere glovebox with a moisture of less than 1 ppm. In the glovebox, the desired ratio (as detailed below) of LPEI and LiTf or NaTf were dissolved in vials with anhydrous methanol, capped and then stirred for 24 hours. To obtain films of the samples, the solutions were cast onto glass slides and then methanol was allowed to evaporate at room temperature in the glovebox. The resulting films were then dried under vacuum for 48 hours at 45&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The composition of the resulting polymers is generally expressed in terms of the ratio of nitrogen atoms in the polymer to metal cations (i.e., N:M ratio). Polymer electrolytes having a N:M ratio of 4:1, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1 and 3:1 were prepared and used for IR and Raman spectroscopic studies and thermal analysis. (See S. York et al., <highlight><italic>Eletrochimica Acta, </italic></highlight>46 (2001) 1533, which is incorporated herein by reference.) Additionally, the conductivity of a number of these samples was measured as further described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> C. Conductivity Measurements </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The ionic conductivities of various samples were determined using impedance spectroscopy, a know method whereby conductivity values are calculated from measurements of the complex impedance of a sample contained in a cell (see, e.g., P. G. Bruce, <highlight><italic>Polymer Electrolyte Reviews, </italic></highlight>Vol. 1 (J. R. MacCallum and C. A. Vincent eds., Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1987)). In this method, the cell is comprised of blocking electrodes, and the real and imaginary parts of the impedance are measured as a function of the alternating current frequency. For the measurements, stainless steel blocking electrodes were used. The sample geometry was determined from the diameter of the cylindrical surfaces of the blocking electrodes, and the sample thickness as measured by a micrometer. The temperature of the sample was controlled by containing the sealed cell in a constant temperature bath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The data for the various samples is summarized in the tables provided below (the sample compositions being given in terms of the nitrogen to cation ratio, in this case N:Li):

<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> (1) General Experiments to Establish Cross-Linking </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> To establish the cross-linking of LPEI in solution, measured amounts of LPEI were placed in glass vials and dissolved in an appropriate amount of absolute methanol. The desired amount of cross-linker was added to each vial, the vials were then capped and the solutions shaken vigorously to ensure homogeneity. The vials were allowed to stand undisturbed at room temperature. Gelation and cross-linking were taken to have occurred when a solution no longer visually exhibited any flow upon tilting at a 900 angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> (2) General Determination of Cross-Linking Parameters </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> In 1 dram vials was placed 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, and 0.30 g LPEI and 1 mL absolute methanol. The vials were capped and the LPEI allowed to dissolve overnight. A measured amount (0.12 g) of 1,6-dibromohexane cross-linker was added to each vial, the vials were capped, shaken thoroughly, and allowed to stand at room temperature until it was observed that the solution no longer flowed when placed on its side (i.e., tilted at a 90&deg; angle). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The time for gelation was taken as the time it took for cross-linking to occur, the respective values obtained were: no gelation after several months (0.10 g LPEI), 168 hours (0.15 g LPEI), 90 hours (0.20 g LPEI), 66 hours (0.25 g LPEI), and 47 hours (0.30 g LPEI). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Overall, the LPEI films were either colorless or had a very slight yellow tinge, and were found to be physically more robust and less tacky than the BPEI counterparts (described below). Generally, flexibility and tackiness were found to decrease, and rigidity increase, with increasing amounts of cross-linker. All films were free-standing, having thicknesses ranging from about 300 to 900 microns. Opacity in the LPEI films when lower amounts of cross-linker were used is consistent with some residual degree of crystallinity of the LPEI segments. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The BPEI films were clear and had a variable light yellow color, some deeper or darker than others, while some were almost colorless. The BPEI films were found to be physically less robust and more tacky than the LPEI counterparts (described above). Generally, flexibility and tackiness were found to decrease, and rigidity increase, with increasing amounts of cross-linker. All films were free-standing, having thicknesses ranging from about 300 to 900 microns. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> LPEI (5.02 g) was dissolved in 50 mL distilled water in a round-bottom flask. Once dissolved, formic acid (88%, 200 mL) and formalin (37%, 125 mL) were added to the solution. The flask was fitted with a reflux condenser, and then the solution was heated to reflux the solvent for 24 hours, after which the solution was allowed to cool. Concentrated HCl (150 mL) was then added. Solvent was removed under reduced pressure to provide the quaternary ammonium hydrochloride salt. The salt was dissolved in distilled water (200 mL) and then NaOH (82 g) was added. The mixture was cooled to about 0&deg; C. A solid polymer/salt complex separated from the remaining solution and was isolated by decanting the liquid from it. The polymer/salt complex was then dissolved in benzene and centrifuged. The polymer solution was decanted from the separated salt and solvent was removed from the supernatant under reduced pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> NMR and IR spectral data for the resulting viscous polymer (43% theoretical yield) were in agreement with literature values.

The ion exchange resin had been converted to the hydroxide form by treatment with aqueous NaOH, followed by washing thoroughly with distilled water. The capacity of the ion exchange column was more than twice the calculated amount needed to neutralize the BPMEI hydrochloride. The column was washed twice with distilled water to remove al BPMEI and the water was removed from the combined aqueous eluents under reduced pressure to give 2.08 g (88% theoretical yield) BPMEI as a very viscous, amber-colored liquid.

<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> LPEI (1.22 g) was cut into small pieces and placed in a three-neck 250 mL round-bottom flask. 2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)acetic acid (55.0 mL) was poured into the reaction flask. The mixture was heated until all the LPEI dissolved. The solution was cooled to 5&deg; C. and NaBH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(about 5 g) was added in the form of small pellets. The thick solution was stirred to insure homogeneity. A reflux condenser was attached to the flask and then the mixture was heated with a 55&deg; C. oil bath for 5 days. The solution was cooled to room temperature (about 20-25&deg; C.) and 50 mL of distilled water was added. NaOH pellets were added with stirring until the pH of the solution was greater than 10. The solution was extracted with CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(5&times;25 mL). Centrifugation was used to separate the organic layer from the aqueous layer and the organic layers were combined. The organic layer was dried over Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The resulting viscous polymer (94% theoretical yield) was characterized by NMR and FTIR.

<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> A sample of LPMOEOEEI (0.52 g) was dissolved in 1 mL methanol in a vial. 1,6-Dibromohexane (0.09 g) was added (about N:Br ratio of 5:1), the solution was thoroughly mixed, the vial capped, and then the solution was allowed to stand at room temperature. After 5 days, the solution had not gelled. The vial was therefore uncapped and the solvent allowed to slowly evaporate. After several more days, after sufficient solvent evaporation, the sample did gel (concentration unknown), to give a flexible, clear, reddish, rubbery solid. </paragraph>

Linear Poly(N-(2-cyanoethyl)ethylenimine) (PCEEI) LPEI (0.50 g) was dissolved with stirring in 20 mL absolute methanol in a round-bottom flask. Acrylonitrile (0.86 g) was added to the solution, and then the flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The solution was heated to reflux for 1.5 hours. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give a 94% theoretical yield of a viscous, liquid polymer.

<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Cross-linking was investigated by first preparing a stock solution of PCEEI in chloroform (PCEEI (0.713 g) dissolved in 1.9 mL of chloroform). Three vials were then charged with 0.5 mL of this stock solution and then 51, 103, and 343 mg of 1,6-dibromohexane were added, respectively, to each. The vials were capped, shaken thoroughly, and then allowed to stand at room temperature until it was observed that the solution no longer flowed when placed on its side (i.e., turned at a 90&deg; angle). The time for gelling was taken as the time for cross-linking to occur: gelation occurred after 72, 42, and 18 hours, respectively. The last of these underwent a phase separation into two layers before gelling. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Two vials were charged with 3 mL distilled water each, and then 0.29 g and 0.57 g, respectively, of poly(allylamine) hydrochloride (commercially available from Polysciences, molecular weight about 60,000). The polymer was allowed to dissolve and then 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane was added (0.43 g and 0.51 g, respectively). The vials were then capped, shaken thoroughly, and allowed to stand at room temperature (about 20-25&deg; C.) until it was observed that the solution no longer flowed when placed on its side (i.e., turned at a 90&deg; angle).

<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Two cross-linked films were made by first dissolving 0.20 g of poly(allylamine) hydrochloride in 6 mL distilled water. Two vials were then charged (3 mL each) with the solution, followed by the addition of 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (9 mg and 33 mg, respectively). The mixtures were thoroughly mixed and poured into flat-bottomed 50 mm diameter glass dishes, which were covered to stop evaporation. The reaction vessels were allowed to stand at room temperature (about 20-25&deg; C.) for 1 day, after which the vessels were uncovered to allow slow evaporation of the solvent. After evaporation of solvent to a constant volume/thickness, coherent, free-standing films of about 0.35 and 0.45 mm thickness, respectively, were able to be removed. The films were found to be sensitive to moisture, becoming hard and brittle under anhydrous conditions but becoming flexible after a few minutes exposure to moisture in the air. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> A. Swelling with Organic &ldquo;Plasticizing&rdquo; Solvents A sample of an LPEI film cross-linked with 1,6-dibromohexane (N:Br ratio of 10:1) was cut into three small, rectangular pieces weighing about 17.1 mg, 20.1 mg, and 24.8 mg, respectively. The pieces were then submerged in propylene carbonate (PC), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), respectively. The pieces were periodically taken out of the solvent, blotted dry, and weighed. After four days, the samples weighed 19.7 mg, 71.4 mg, and 41.2 mg, respectively, and the DMSO sample having been found to have reached an approximately constant weight. </paragraph>

A 4&times;6 cm piece of thin (about 30 micron) Sn foil was then carefully place on the slightly tacky polymer layer and gently pressed to ensure contact. The resulting film was then cut into about 1&times;1 cm squares (about 300 microns thick) with a sharp scissors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> These thin batteries showed a potential of about 0.55 V and a current output of about 10 &mgr;A.

The mixture was thoroughly mixed using a spatula. Graphite powder (0.25 g) was added, the contents were thoroughly mixed, and then 1,2-dichloroethane (0.25 g) was added, the contents again being thoroughly mixed after this addition. The cup was sealed and allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 minutes to allow the graphite to partially settle, and then it was heated in a 70&deg; C. oven for about 30 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> A second small vessel was charged with 0.25 g BPEI, 0.13 g N-methylpyrrolidone, and 0.05 g LiTf.

<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> In a dry box, the rectangular sample was placed with its graphite face against the center of a 3.5&times;12.5 mm piece of copper foil. A piece of 0.75 mm thick lithium ribbon was scraped with a razor blade to expose fresh, shiny metal surfaces, and then about a 1.5&times;0.8 cm of the lithium ribbon was cut off and placed on top of the electrolyte layer of the sample. The sample was covered with a piece of copper foil (about 1.8&times;1 cm), and then the edges from the top copper foil to the bottom copper foil were sealed using Scotch tape, in order to provide stability and slow any exposure to moisture in the air.

The cup was sealed and the mixture was allowed to set-up or gel overnight. A very thick slurry of spherical Cu powder (2.0 g, 200 mesh Copper in 0.2 g of a 1:1 BPEI/1,2-dichloroethane solution) was added onto the sample to a depth of about 3 mm, and then the sample was sealed and allowed to stand overnight to allow the cross-linking reaction to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> The resulting battery was found to be a very tough, single piece pellet, which had a potential of 0.4 V and a current of 100 nA to 1 &mgr;A (the potential and current varying with the quality of the contact). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Following the general procedure outlined for Sample 2, above, a third Cu/Zn sample was made in a small (about 15 mm diameter) polyethylene cup using 1:1 BPEI/N-methylpyrrolidone (&ldquo;NMP&rdquo;) and 1,3-dibromopropane as the cross-linker. To the cup was added a first layer comprising Zn in a 1:1 BPEI/NMP solution (about 3 drops, or 2 mm in thickness), followed after about 10 minutes by the addition of a solution of only BPEI/NMP (about 3 drops, or 1 mm in thickness), and then about 10 minutes after that by the addition of Cu in a 1:1 BPEI/NMP solution (about 3 drops, or 2 mm in thickness). After allowing the cross-linking reaction to be completed, a battery was obtained that was found to be not very robust, but was found to be a single piece pellet with a potential of 0.8 V and a current of 20 &mgr;A to 50 &mgr;A (the potential and currently varying with the quality of the contact). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> (2) Secondary (Rechargeable) Lithium Ion &ldquo;Rocking-Chair&rdquo; Battery </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> A stock electrolyte solution of LiTf (0.41 g), N-methylpyrrolidone (0.41 g), and methanol (0.10 g) was prepared in a small test tube. A small vessel was charged with 0.32 g BPEI, 0.31 g lithium manganese oxide spinel (Kerr-McGee, Li<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Mn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>, where x is about 1 and y is about 4), and 0.26 g of the electrolyte stock solution and the mixture was thoroughly mixed using a spatula. 1,2-Dichloroethane (0.15 g) was added, the contents were thoroughly mixed, and then 0.62 g of the mixture were transferred to a small polyethylene cup. The cup was sealed and heated in a 70&deg; C. oven for about 18 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> A small vessel was then charged with 0.18 g BPEI, 0.10 g of the electrolyte stock solution and 1,2-Dichloroethane (0.13 g) were added, the contents were thoroughly mixed, and then 0.22 g of the mixture were poured on top of the spinel layer. The cup was sealed and heated in a 70&deg; C. oven for about 10 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> A small vessel was then charged with 0.40 g BPEI, 0.31 g graphite (a mixture of about 95% Alfa C graphite and 5% KS6 carbon black), and 0.25 g of the electrolyte stock solution, and then the mixture was thoroughly mixed using a spatula. 1,2-Dichloroethane (0.26 g) was added, the contents were thoroughly mixed, and then 0.61 g of the mixture were poured on top of the electrolyte layer. The cup was sealed and heated in a 70&deg; C. oven for about 30 minutes. The sample was allowed to cool, and the battery disk was removed from the polyethylene cup to give a solid disk. The edges were trimmed and the disk was cut to give a rectangle about 2.5&times;10&times;9 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> A small vessel was charged with 0.30 g LiTf, 0.30 g N-methylpyrrolidone, and 0.07 g methanol. The mixture was thoroughly mixed to dissolve the salt, and then this solution was added to 0.80 g BPEI in a small polyethylene cup. The mixture was thoroughly mixed. 1,2-Dichloroethane (0.54 g) was added, the contents were thoroughly mixed and the cup was sealed and heated in a 70&deg; C. oven for about 60 minutes. The sample was allowed to cool, and the battery disk was removed from the polyethylene cup to give a solid disk. The edges were trimmed and the disk was cut to give a rectangle about 3&times;10&times;8 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> The spinel/electrolyte/graphite sample was placed between two stainless steel electrodes, under moderate pressure to ensure good contact. The spinel side electrode was connected to the positive pole of a Lake Shore Cryotronics 120 constant current source, and the graphite side was connected to the negative pole. The sample was charged at a current of 300 &mgr;A for 2.5 hours, and its discharge was monitored using a Kiethley 485 Autoranging Picoammeter over several hours. The sample was charged/discharged at a current of 100 &mgr;A, and finally at a current of 30 &mgr;A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> The cross-linked BPEI/electrolyte sample was treated similarly. It was clear that this sample charged much more quickly and discharged much more quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Each sample was charged at a current of 30 &mgr;A for 30 minutes. The samples were allowed to rest for 5 minutes, and then the discharge was monitored continuously using the picoammeter. The cross-linked BPEI/electrolyte sample discharged very quickly, from about 5 &mgr;A to 0.5 &mgr;A after 5 minutes, reflecting the electrolytic capacitance of the sample. In contrast, the spinel/electrolyte/graphite sample discharged from about 9 &mgr;A to 5 &mgr;A after 5 minutes, and 3.3 &mgr;A after 30 minutes, reflecting the combined, and much greater (about 10&times;), electrolytic and chemical capacitance of the device, thus demonstrating chemical battery behavior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Finally, after about 1 week, after having been stored under ambient conditions, the cross-linked BPEI/electrolyte sample was tested again. It was found to have a voltage in excess of about 1 volt, with a current output of about 2 &mgr;A. It was found that this sample could be easily recharged to a voltage in excess of 2 volts, with a current output of about 10 &mgr;A (which was found to be sufficient to power a common handheld calculator). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, it will be seen that the several features of the invention are achieved. As various changes could be made in the above material and processes without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The ability to track the location or identity of a component or item of interest has presented a significant challenge for industry and science. For example, the demands of keeping track of consumer products, such as items in a grocery store or jewelry, and the interest in identification devices, such as security cards, has led to the need for a secure and convenient system. Additionally, emerging technologies such as combinatorial chemistry, genomics research, and microfluidics also require the ability to identify and track the location of large numbers of items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A traditionally used method for tracking the location or identity of a component or item of interest is Universal Product Code technology, or barcode technology, which uses a linear array of elements that are either printed directly on an object or on labels that are affixed to the object. These bar code elements typically comprise bars and spaces, with bars of varying widths representing strings of binary ones and spaces of varying widths representing strings of binary zeros. Bar codes can be detectable optically using devices such as scanning laser beams or handheld wands, or they can be implemented in magnetic media. The readers and scanning systems electro-optically decode the symbol to multiple alpha-numerical characters that are intended to be descriptive of the article or some characteristic thereof. Such characters are typically represented in digital form as an input to a data processing system for applications in point-of-sale processing and inventory control to name a few. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although traditional bar codes typically only contain five or six letters or digits, two dimensional barcodes have also been developed in which one-dimensional bar codes are stacked with horizontal guard bars between them to increase the information density. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,786 describes the use of a high density two-dimensional bar code symbol for use in bar code applications. Unfortunately, although the information density of barcode technology has improved, this technology is often easily destructible, and the interference of dust, dirt and physical damage limits the accuracy of the information acquired from the readout equipment. Additionally, because of the difficulty of etching the barcode on many items, it is also difficult to apply to a wide range of uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another technology that has been developed for labeling objects includes a composition comprising silicon or silicon dioxide microparticles and a powder, fluid or gas to be applied to objects such as vehicles, credit cards and jewelry (WO 95/29437). This system typically allows the formation of 200 million particles on a single wafer, each of the particles on one wafer being designed to be of identical shape and size so that when the particles are freed from the wafer substrate one is left with a suspension containing a single particle type which can thus be identified and associated with a particular item of interest. This system, although information dense, is also not practical for a wide range of application. One of the advantages explicitly stated in the application includes the unlikely event of unauthorized replication of the particles because of the non-trivial process of micromachining used which requires specialized equipment and skills. Thus, this process would not be widely amenable to a range of uses for inventory control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition to abovementioned barcoding and microparticle inventory control schemes, emerging technologies such as combinatorial chemistry have also resulted in the development of various encoding schemes (See, for example, Czarnik, A. W., &ldquo;Encoding Methods for Combinatorial Chemistry&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., </italic></highlight>1997, 1, 60). The need for this development has arisen in part from the split and pool technique utilized in combinatorial chemistry to generate libraries on the order of one million compounds. Split and pool synthesis involves dividing a collection in beads into N groups, where N represents the number of different reagents being used in a particular reaction stage, and after the reaction is performed, pooling all of these groups together and repeating the split and pool process until the desired reaction sequence is completed. Clearly, in order to keep track of each of the compounds produced from a reaction series, the beads must be &ldquo;tagged&rdquo; or encoded with information at each stage to enable identification of the compound of interest or the reaction pathway producing the compound. The tags used to encode the information, however, must be robust to the conditions being employed in the chemical synthesis and must be easily identifiable to obtain the information. Exemplary encoding techniques that have been developed include the use of chemically robust small organic molecules (&ldquo;tags&rdquo;) that are cleaved from the bead after the synthesis is completed and analyzed using mass spectroscopy. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,324; U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,099). The disadvantage of this method is that the &ldquo;tags&rdquo; must be cleaved from the bead in order to gain information about the identity of the compound of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In response to this, several groups have developed encoding schemes that allow analysis while the &ldquo;tags&rdquo; are still attached to the supports. For example, Radiofrequency Encoded Combinatorial (REC&square;) chemistry combines recent advances in microelectronics, sensors, and chemistry and uses a Single or Multiple Addressable Radiofrequency Tag (SMART&square;) semiconductor unit to record encoding and other relevant information along the synthetic pathway (Nicolaou et al., <highlight><italic>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. </italic></highlight>1995, 34, 2289). The disadvantage of this system, however, is that the SMART&square; memory devices utilized are very large in size (mm), and thus scanning the bead to decode the information becomes difficult. Another example of on-bead decoding includes the use of colored and fluorescent beads ( Egner et al., <highlight><italic>Chem. Commun. </italic></highlight>1997, 735), in which a confocal microscope laser system was used to obtain the fluorescence spectra of fluorescent dyes. The drawback of this method, however, is the tendency of the dyes to undergo internal quenching by either energy transfer or reabsorption of the emitted light. Additionally, this system is not able to uniquely and distinctly identify a range of dyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Clearly, it would be desirable to develop a general information dense encoding system flexible, robust and practical enough to be utilized both in general inventory control and in emerging technologies. This system would also be capable of distinctly and uniquely identifying particular items or components of interest. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a novel encoding system and methods for determining the location and/or identity of a particular item or component of interest. In particular, the present invention utilizes a &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; comprising one or more particle size distributions of semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) having characteristic spectral emissions to either &ldquo;track&rdquo; the location of a particular item of interest or to identify a particular item of interest. The semiconductor nanocrystals used in the inventive &ldquo;barcoding&rdquo; scheme can be tuned to a desired wavelength to produce a characteristic spectral emission by changing the composition and size of the quantum dot. Additionally, the intensity of the emission at a particular characteristic wavelength can also be varied, thus enabling the use of binary or higher order encoding schemes. The information encoded by the quantum dot can be spectroscopically decoded, thus providing the location and/or identity of the particular item or component of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment, the method involves providing a composition comprising an item of interest, and one or more sizes of semiconductor nanocrystals having characteristic spectral emissions, or providing a composition comprising a support, an item of interest, and one or more sizes of semiconductor nanocrystals; subjecting said composition to a primary light source to obtain the spectral emissions for said one or more sizes of quantum dots on said composition; and correlating said spectral emission with said item of interest. The present method, in preferred embodiments, can be used to encode the identity of biomolecules, particularly DNA sequences, or other items, including, but not limited to, consumer products, identification tags and fluids. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS DEFINITIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Quantum Dot&trade; particle&rdquo;: As used herein, the term &ldquo;Quantum Dot&trade; particle&rdquo; includes a semiconductor nanocrystal with size dependent optical and electrical properties. In particular, the band gap energy of a semiconductor nanocrystal varies with the diameter of the crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Identification unit or barcode&rdquo;: As used herein, the term &ldquo;identification unit&rdquo; is used synonymously with the term &ldquo;barcode&rdquo;, and comprises one or more sizes of semiconductor nanocrystals, each size of semiconductor nanocrystal having a characteristic emission spectrum. The &ldquo;identification unit&rdquo; or &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; enables the determination of the location or identity of a particular item or matter of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Item of interest&rdquo;: As used herein, the term &ldquo;item of interest&rdquo; is used synonymously with the term &ldquo;component of interest&rdquo; and refers to any item, including, but not limited to, consumer item, fluid, gas, solid, chemical compound, and biomolecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Biomolecule&rdquo;: As used herein, the term &ldquo;biomolecule&rdquo; refers to molecules (e.g., proteins, amino acids, nucleic acids, nucleotides, carbohydrates, sugars, lipids, etc.) that are found in nature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;One or more sizes of semiconductor nanocrystals&rdquo;: As used herein, the phrase &ldquo;one or more sizes of semiconductor nanocrystals&rdquo; is used synonymously with the phrase &ldquo;one or more particle size distributions of semiconductor nanocrystals&rdquo;. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that particular sizes of semiconductor nanocrystals are actually obtained as particle size distributions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The phrase &ldquo;associated with&rdquo; is used herein to indicate items that are physically linked by, for example, covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such van der Waals or hydrophbic interactions, encapsulation, embedding, or the like. The phrase &ldquo;associated with&rdquo; also intends maintaining a correspondence between items by other than physical linkage, e.g., through the use of a look-up table or other method of recording the association/correspondence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Recognizing the need to identify and locate specific items or components of interest, the present invention provides a novel encoding system. In particular, the present invention utilizes a &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; comprising one or more particle size distributions of semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots), having characteristic spectral emissions, to either &ldquo;track&rdquo; the location of a particular item of interest or to identify a particular item of interest. The semiconductor nanocrystals used in the inventive &ldquo;barcoding&rdquo; scheme can be tuned to a desired wavelength to produce a characteristic spectral emission by changing the composition and size of the quantum dot, and additionally, the intensity of the emission at a particular characteristic wavelength can also be varied, thus enabling the use of binary or higher order encoding schemes. The information encoded by the quantum dots can be spectroscopically decoded, thus providing the location and/or identity of the particular item or component of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The ability of the semiconductor nanocrystals to be utilized in the inventive barcode system results from their unique characteristics. Semiconductor nanocrystals have radii that are smaller than the bulk exciton Bohr radius and constitute a class of materials intermediate between molecular and bulk forms of matter. Quantum confinement of both the electron and hole in all three dimensions leads to an increase in the effective band gap of the material with decreasing crystallite size. Consequently, both the optical absorption and emission of quantum dots shift to the blue (higher energies). Upon exposure to a primary light source, each quantum dot distribution is capable of emitting energy in narrow spectral widths, as narrow as 25-30 nm, and with a symmetric, nearly Gaussian line shape, thus providing an easy way to identify a particular quantum dot. As one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, the linewidths are dependent on the size heterogeneity of the quantum dots in each preparation. Single quantum dot complexes have been observed to have full width half max as narrow as 12-15 nm. In addition, quantum dot distributions with larger linewidths in the range of 40-60 nm can be readily made and have the same physical characteristics as quantum dots with narrower linewidths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Exemplary materials for use as quantum dots in the present invention include, but are not limited to group II-VI, III-V and group IV semiconductors such as ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, GaN, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, InSb, AlS, AlP, AlSb, PbS, PbSe, Ge and Si and ternary and quaternary mixtures thereof. The semiconductor nanocrystals are characterized by their uniform nanometer size. By &ldquo;nanometer&rdquo; size, it is meant less than about 150 Angstroms (&angst;), and preferably in the range of 12-150 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the selection of the composition of the quantum dot, as well as the size of the quantum dot, affects the characteristic spectral emission wavelength of the quantum dot. Thus, as one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, a particular composition of a quantum dot as listed above will be selected based upon the spectral region being monitored. For example, quantum dots that emit energy in the visible range include, but are not limited to CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnSe, ZnTe, GaP, and GaAs. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a color photograph of several suspensions of different sizes of ZnS overcoated CdSe quantum dots in hexane illustrating the wide range of colors available for use in the present invention. Quantum dots that emit energy in the near IR range include, but are not limited to, InP, InAs, InSb, PbS, and PbSe. Finally, quantum dots that emit energy in the blue to near-ultraviolet include, but are not limited to ZnS and GaN. For any particular composition selected for the quantum dots to be used in the inventive system, it is possible to tune the emission to a desired wavelength by controlling the size of the particular composition of the quantum dot. In preferred embodiments, 5-20 discrete emissions (five to twenty different size populations or distributions distinguishable from one another) are obtained for any particular composition, although one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that fewer than five emissions and more than twenty emissions could be used depending on the monodispersity of the quantum dot particles. If high information density is required, and thus a greater number of distinct emissions, the nanocrystals are also substantially monodisperse within the broad nanometer range given above (12-150 &angst;). By monodisperse, as that term is used herein, it means a colloidal system in which the suspended particles have substantially identical size and shape. In preferred embodiments for high information density applications, monodisperse particles deviate less than 10% rms in diameter, and preferably less than 5%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Monodisperse quantum dots have been described in detail in Murray et al. (<highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>1993, 115, 8706), and in the thesis of Christopher Murray, &ldquo;Synthesis and Characterization of II-VI Quantum Dots and Their Assembly into 3-D Quantum Dot Superlattices&rdquo;, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, September, 1995, which are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference. One of ordinary skill in the art will also realize that the number of discrete emissions that can be distinctly observed for a given composition depends not only upon the monodispersity of the particles, but also on the deconvolution techniques employed. Quantum dots, unlike dye molecules, can be easily modeled as Gaussians and therefore are more easily and more accurately deconvoluted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> However, for some applications high information density will not be required and it may be more economically attractive to use more polydisperse particles. Thus, for applications that do not require high information density, the linewidth of the emission may be in the range of 40-60 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In addition to the ability to tune the emission energy by controlling the size of the particular quantum dot, the intensities of that particular emission observed at a specific wavelength are also capable of being varied, thus increasing the potential information density provided by the quantum dot &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; system. In preferred embodiments, 2-15 different intensities may be achieved for a particular emission at a desired wavelength, however, one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that more than fifteen different intensities may be achieved, depending upon the particular application of the inventive identification units. For the purposes of the present invention, different intensities may be achieved by varying the concentrations of the particular size quantum dot attached to, embedded within or associated with an item or component of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment, the surface of the quantum dot is also modified to enhance the efficiency of the emissions, by adding an overcoating layer to the quantum dot. The overcoating layer is particularly preferred because at the surface of the quantum dot, surface defects can result in traps for electron or holes that degrade the electrical and optical properties of the quantum dot. An insulating layer at the surface of the quantum dot provides an atomically abrupt jump in the chemical potential at the interface which eliminates energy states that can serve as traps for the electrons and holes. This results in higher efficiency in the luminescent process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Suitable materials for the overcoating layer include semiconductors having a higher band gap energy than the quantum dot. In addition to having a band gap energy greater than the quantum dots, suitable materials for the overcoating layer should have good conduction and valence band offset with respect to the quantum dot. Thus, the conduction band is desirably higher and the valence band is desirably lower than those of the quantum dot. For quantum dots that emit energy in the visible (e.g., CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnSe, ZnTe, GaP, GaAs) or near IR (e.g., InP, InAs, InSb, PbS, PbSe), a material that has a band gap energy in the ultraviolet regions may be used. Exemplary materials include ZnS, GaN, and magnesium chalcogenides, e.g., MgS, MgSe, and MgTe. For quantum dots that emit in the near IR, materials having a band gap energy in the visible, such as CdS or CdSe, may also be used. The overcoating layer may include as many as eight monolayers of the semiconductor material. The preparation of a coated quantum dot may be found in U.S. Ser. No. 08/969,302, filed Nov. 13, 1997 and entitled &ldquo;Highly Luminescent Color-Selective Materials&rdquo;, and Dabbousi et al., (<highlight><italic>J. Phys. Chem. B, </italic></highlight>1997, 101, 9463) and Kuno et al., (<highlight><italic>J. Phys. Chem., </italic></highlight>1997, 106, 9869). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> After selection of a particular collection of quantum dot composition and sizes as discussed above to associate with an item of interest, the quantum dots can be attached to, embedded within or associated with that particular item of interest. As one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, the item of interest must be sufficiently reactive with the surface of the quantum dot, or must be sufficiently compatible with the quantum dot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Most quantum dots are prepared in coordinating solvent, such as trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and trioctyl phosphine (TOP) resulting in the formation of a passivating organic layer on the dot surface comprised of the organic solvent. This layer is present on quantum dots containing an overcoating and those that do not contain an overcoating. Thus, either of these classes of passivated quantum dots are readily soluble in organic solvents, such as toluene, chloroform and hexane. As one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, these functional moieties may be readily displaced or modified to provide an outer coating that renders the quantum dots suitable for use as the identification units of the present invention. Furthermore, based upon the desired application, a portion of the quantum dot functionality, or the entire surface of the quantum dot functionality may be modified by a displacement reaction, based upon the desired application of the inventive identification units. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts general displacement reactions of certain functional moieties to provide a quantum dots with modified functionalities for use in the inventive method. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> also depicts the ability to displace a specific percentage of moieties on the surface of the quantum dots. For example, reaction A, depicts the partial displacement of moiety X by moiety Y, whereas reaction B depicts the complete displacement of moiety X by moiety Y for a quantum dot having no overcoating layer. Reactions C and D depict the partial and complete displacement reactions for overcoated quantum dots, respectively. In general, moieties such as TOPO and TOP, as well as other moieties may be readily displaced and replaced with other functional moieties, including, but not limited to carboxylic acids, amines, aldehydes, and styrene to name a few. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that factors relevant to the success of a particular displacement reaction include the concentration of the replacement moiety, temperature and reactivity. Thus, for the purposes of the present invention, any functional moiety may be utilized that is capable of displacing an existing functional moiety to provide a quantum dot with a modified functionality for a specific use of the identification units of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The ability to utilize a general displacement reaction to selectively modify the surface functionality of the quantum dots enables functionalization for specific uses of the inventive identification units. In one particularly preferred embodiment, water soluble quantum dots are provided for use in aqueous environments. In the case of water-soluble quantum dots, the outer layer includes a compound having at least one linking moiety that attaches to the surface of the particle and that terminates in at least one hydrophilic moiety. The linking and hydrophilic moieties are spanned by a hydrophobic region sufficient to prevent charge transfer across the region. The hydrophobic region also provides a &ldquo;pseudo-hydrophobic&rdquo; environment for the nanocrystal and thereby shields it from aqueous surroundings. A detailed description of methods for making water soluble quantum dots may be found in the application entitled &ldquo;Water Soluble Luminescent Nanocrystals&rdquo; filed the same day herewith, and incorporated in its entirety by reference. In preferred embodiments, the hydrophilic moiety may be a polar or charged (positive or negative) group. The polarity or charge of the group provides the necessary hydrophilic interactions with water to provide stable solutions or suspensions of the quantum dot. Exemplary hydrophilic groups include polar groups such as hydroxides (&mdash;OH), amines, polyethers, such as polyethylene glycol and the like, as well as charged groups, such as carboxylates (&mdash;CO<highlight><superscript>2&minus;</superscript></highlight>), sulfonates (SO<highlight><superscript>3&minus;</superscript></highlight>), phosphates (&mdash;PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2&minus;</superscript></highlight> and &mdash;PO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2&minus;</superscript></highlight>), nitrates, ammonium salts (&mdash;NH<highlight><superscript>4&plus;</superscript></highlight>), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In another particularly preferred embodiment, a displacement reaction may be employed to modify the quantum dot to improve the solubility in a particular organic solvent. For example, if it is desired to associate the quantum dots with a particular solvent or liquid, such as pyridine, the surface can be specifically modified with pyridine or pyridine-like moieties to ensure solvation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In yet another particularly preferred embodiment, the surface layer is modified by displacement to render the quantum dot reactive for a particular coupling reaction. For example, displacement of TOPO moieties with a group containing a carboxylic acid moiety enables the reaction of the modified quantum dots with amine containing moieties (commonly found on solid support units) to provide an amide linkage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Likewise, the surface of the quantum dot can also be modified to create a surface on the quantum dot similar to an object that the quantum dot will be associated with. For example, the quantum dot surface can be modified using a displacement reaction to create styrene or acrylate moieties, thus enabling the incorporation of the quantum dots into polystyrene, polyacrylate or other polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> After selection of the composition of quantum dot for the desired range of spectral emission and selection of a desired surface functionalization compatible with the system of interest, it may also be desirable to select the minimum number of quantum dots needed to observe a distinct and unique spectral emission of sufficient intensity for spectral identification. Selection criteria important in determining the minimum number of quantum dots needed to observe a distinct and unique spectral emission of sufficient intensity include providing a sufficient number of quantum dots that are bright (i.e., that emit light versus those that are dark) and providing a sufficient number of quantum dots to average out over the blinking effect observed in single quantum dot emissions (Mnirmal et al., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>1996, 383, 802). In one particularly preferred embodiment, at least eight quantum dots of a particular composition and particle size distribution are provided. For example, if a &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; were provided that utilized three different particle size distributions of a particular composition, it would be most desirable <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to utilize eight of each of the three different particle size distributions of a quantum dot, in order to observe sufficiently intense spectral emissions from each to provide reliable information regarding the location or identity of a particular item or matter of interest. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize, however, that fewer than eight quantum dots of a particular composition and particle size distribution could be utilized provided that a unique spectral emission of sufficient intensity is observed, as determined by the selection criteria set forth above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As discussed previously, the ability of the quantum dots to produce discrete optical transitions, along with the ability to vary the intensity of these optical transitions, enables the development of a versatile and dense encoding scheme. The characteristic emissions produced by one or more sizes of quantum dots attached to, associated with, or embedded within a particular support or matter enables the identification of the item or composition of interest and/or its location. For example, by providing N sizes of quantum dots (each having a discrete optical transition), each having M distinguishable states resulting from the absence of the quantum dot, or from different intensities resulting from a particular discrete optical transition, M<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>different states can be uniquely defined. In the case of M&equals;2 where the two states could be the presence or absence of the quantum dot, the encoding scheme would thus be defined by a base 2 or binary code. In the case of M&equals;3 where the three states could be the presence of a quantum dot at two distinguishable intensities or its absence, the encoding scheme would be defined by a base 3 code. Herein, such base M codes where M&gt;2 are termed higher order codes. The advantage of higher order codes over a binary order code is that fewer identifiers are required to encode the same quantity of information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As one of ordinary skill in the art will realize, the ability to develop a higher order encoding system is dependent upon the number of different intensities capable of detection by both the hardware and the software utilized in the decoding system. In particularly preferred embodiments, each discrete emission or color, is capable of being detectable at two to twenty different intensities. In a particularly preferred embodiment wherein ten different intensities are available, it is possible to employ a base 11 code comprising the absence of the quantum dot, or the detection of the quantum dot at 10 different intensities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Clearly, the advantages of the quantum dots, namely the ability to observe discrete optical transitions at a plurality of intensities, provides a powerful and dense encoding scheme that can be employed in a variety of disciplines. In general, one or more quantum dots may act as a barcode, wherein each of the one or more quantum dots produces a distinct emissions spectrum. These characteristic emissions can be observed as colors, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, if in the visible region of the spectrum, or may also be decoded to provide information about the particular wavelength at which the discrete transition is observed. Likewise, for quantum dots producing emissions in the infared or ultraviolet regions, the characteristic wavelengths that the discrete optical transitions occur at provide information about the identity of the particular quantum dot, and hence about the identity of or location of the item or matter of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> An example of a specific system for automated detection that could be employed for use in the present invention includes, but is not limited to, an imaging scheme comprising an excitation source, a monochromator (or any device capable of spectrally resolving the image, or a set of narrow band filters) and a detector array. In one embodiment, the apparatus would consist of a blue or UV source of light, of a wavelength shorter than that of the luminescence detected. This could be a broadband UV light source, such as a deuterium lamp with a filter in front; the output of a white light source such as a xenon lamp or a deuterium lamp after passing through a monochromator to extract out the desired wavelengths; or any of a number of cw gas lasers, including but not limited to any of the Argon Ion laser lines (457, 488, 514, etc. nm), a HeCd laser; solid state diode lasers in the blue such as GaN and GaAs (doubled) based lasers or the doubled or tripled output of YAG or YLF based lasers; or any of the pulsed lasers with output in the blue, to name a few. The luminescence from the dots would be passed through an imaging subtracting double monochromator (or two single monochromators with the second one reversed from the first), for example, consisting of two gratings or prisms and a slit between the two gratings or prisms. The monochromators or gratings or prisms can also be replaced with a computer controlled color filter wheel where each filter is a narrow band filter centered at the wavelength of emission of one of the dots. The monochromator assembly has more flexibility because any color can be chosen as the center wavelength. Furthermore, a CCD camera or some other two dimensional detector records the images, and software color codes that image to the wavelength chosen above. The system then moves the gratings to a new color and repeats the process. As a result of this process, a set of images of the same spatial region is obtained and each is color-coded to a particular wavelength which is needed to rapidly analyze the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the apparatus is a scanning system as opposed to the above imaging scheme. In a scanning scheme, the sample to be analyzed is scanned with respect to a microscope objective. The luminescence is put through a single monochromator or a grating or prism to spectrally resolve the colors. The detector is a diode array that then records the colors that are emitted at a particular spatial position. The software then ultimately recreates the scanned image and decodes it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> More particularly, specific preferred embodiments for uses of the inventive encoding system are described with reference to the following examples. These examples are provided only for the purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Applications to Fluid Dynamics and Microfluidics </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In one particularly preferred embodiment, the inventive system can be utilized to track or trace the location of a component of interest. For example, fluid dynamics involves generally monitoring the interaction between different fluid components, and thus the location of individual molecules of the desired fluid provides valuable information about the effectiveness of and the degree of interaction between separate components, specifically the controlled movement and mixing of components. In the method of the present invention, one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the quantum dots can be appropriately functionalized to facilitate interaction with the desired component of interest (so that the quantum dots are compatible with the fluid they are intended to act as tracers for), as discussed in detail earlier, and subsequent mixing of the individual components can be effected. In but one example, if the interaction between two fluids having different characteristics, such as pyridine and dimethylsulfoxide, is being studied, the surface of the quantum dots can be modified with pyridine or dimethylsulfoxide moieties to ensure association of or compatibility of a particular size distribution of quantum dots with the appropriate fluid. Because each the quantum dots are specifically associated with a particular component, it is then possible to take a photograph of the reaction mixture with an ultraviolet lamp and, based upon the discrete optical emissions produced from the quantum dots, gain information about the degree of interaction of the individual components. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a general method for fluid dynamics, wherein two streams of fluid (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>), represented by X and Y in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, are introduced into a reaction chamber (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) and the mixing of the fluids is monitored by taking a &ldquo;picture&rdquo; at a given time with an excitation source to observe the position of the quantum dots associated with the particular fluid. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> depicts an enlargement of the reaction chamber (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) and shows the association of the quantum dots (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) with a particular fluid of interest (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the ability of the quantum dots to produce discrete transitions enables the mixing of N components, where N represents the number of discrete transitions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> One particularly preferred application for this system for location identification described above is the monitoring of microfluidic molecular systems (MicroFlumes). These microfluidic systems perform multiple reaction and analysis techniques in one microinstrument for specificity and validation, they are completely automated, they contain multiple parallel reaction paths (as opposed to the sequential analysis required today) and provide the capability for hundreds of operations to be performed without manual intervention. (See http://web-ext2.darpa.mil/eto/mFlumes/index.html) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots can be used as in the general method described above, where each quantum dot or combination thereof can be associated with or attached to a specific component of interest and upon mixing of the various components, and providing a primary light source, can provide information about the degree and type of interaction between the different components. One of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the inventive encoding system is not limited to the fluid dynamics applications described above; rather the inventive system is capable of being utilized in any system where the tracking of the location of a component or item, such as a gas, liquid, solid, or consumer item (such as dry-cleaned clothing) is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Identification of an Object </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The system of the present invention can also be utilized to identify specific objects including, but not limited to, jewelry, paper, biomolecules such as DNA, vehicles and identification cards. For example, the quantum dots can be appropriately functionalized for incorporation into or attachment to the surface of the object of interest, as discussed above, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> depicts the incorporation of the quantum dots into an item of interest (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), wherein the surface of quantum dot has been modified to enable incorporation into the item of interest. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> depicts the coating of a quantum dot composition (<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) into an item of interest (<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>), wherein the surface of the quantum dot (<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) is modified to interact with the composition medium X (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). In but one example, the quantum dot surface may be functionalized with a specific percentage of amine moieties, thus enabling incorporation into paper, which is comprised of carbohydrate moieties. In other embodiments, the quantum dots may be appropriately functionalized with moieties such as styrene or acrylate to enable incorporation into polymers. The polymers containing the identification units can then be coated onto, or incorporated within specific items such as identification cards. The ease with which the quantum dots can be incorporated into the item and the fact that the quantum dot based &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; is invisible, provides a useful system for labeling objects. The ability of the quantum dot &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; system to encode large amounts of information, and thus large numbers of items, provides an advantage over existing barcode or microparticle systems discussed previously. The identification of the item of interest from a collection of items can be effected by providing a primary light source and correlating the spectral emissions to a collection of quantum dots which encode a particular item of interest. In another particularly preferred embodiment, the present system may be utilized to keep track of the identity of biomolecules, such as DNA sequences, while they are subjected to reaction processes and chemical manipulations. The biomolecules, or DNA sequences, could be &ldquo;tagged&rdquo; themselves, or, alternatively, the biomolecules could be attached to a support, wherein the support is &ldquo;tagged&rdquo; with one or more sizes of quantum dots encoding the identity of the DNA sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Encoding Combinatorial Libraries </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In another particularly preferred embodiment, the inventive quantum dots may also be used to identify a particular compound in a library of compounds by encoding a particular reaction sequence employed for each of the compounds in the synthesis of complex combinatorial libraries, and thus acting as an identifier. Because of the desirability for the production of large numbers of complex compounds, particularly using a split and pool method, the development of encoding techniques to identify each compound of interest has become important. Because of the small quantity of final product or compound produced from such methods, identifying these products would generally not be feasible. However, by associating each stage or combination of stages of the serial synthesis with an identifier which defines the choice of variables such as reactant, reagent, reaction conditions, or a combination of these, one can use the identifiers to define the reaction history of each definable and separable substrate. The spectral analysis of the quantum dots allows for ready identification of the reaction history. For example, one can determine a characteristic of a product of a synthesis, usually a chemical or biological characteristic by various screening techniques, and then identify the reaction history and thereby the structure of that product, which has the desired characteristic, by virtue of the quantum dot &ldquo;barcode&rdquo; associated with the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The use of the instant multiple identification system avoids the necessity of carrying out a complicated cosynthesis which reduces yields and requires multiple protecting groups, and avoids the necessity of using sequenceable tags which are necessarily chemically labile. Both the necessity of multiple protecting groups and the intrinsic instability of all known sequenceable tagging molecules (i.e. nucleic acid or peptide oligomers) severely limit the chemistry which may be used in the synthesis of the library element or ligand. Additionally, the present system avoids the need to cleave the tags from the solid support for analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the advantage of providing a distinct and non-overlapping resonance, capable of detection at different intensities, enables the use of a binary encoding system or higher. For example, the absence or presence of a particular size quantum dot could be used in a binary system. However, the use of different intensities, of the same color enables the use of a higher order encoding system, each color intensity encoding a particular characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to the method of the present invention, the products to be encoded include, but are not limited to biomolecules (such as peptides and oligonucleotides, organic compounds, and inorganic compounds) and catalysts resulting from combinatorial synthesis. Exemplary combinatorial libraries that can be synthesized using the present encoding method include, but are not limited to peptide libraries, peptidomimetics, carbohydrates, organometallic catalysts and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> small molecule libraries (For examples see, Kahne, D. <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., </italic></highlight>1997, 1, 130; Hruby et al., <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., </italic></highlight>1997, 1, 114; Gravert et al., <highlight><italic>Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., </italic></highlight>1997, 1, 107). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment, a solid phase synthesis technique such as split and pool synthesis is utilized, in which the desired scaffold structures are attached to the solid phase directly or though a linking unit, as discussed above. Advantages of solid phase techniques include the ability to more easily conduct multi-step reactions and the ability to drive reactions to completion because excess reagents can be utilized and the unreacted reagent washed away. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Perhaps one of the most significant advantages of solid phase synthesis is the ability to use a technique called &ldquo;split and pool&rdquo;, in addition to the parallel synthesis technique, developed by <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> Furka. (Furka et al., <highlight><italic>Abstr. </italic></highlight>14<highlight><italic>th Int. Congr. Biochem., </italic></highlight>Prague, Czechoslovakia, 1988, 5, 47; Furka et al., <highlight><italic>Int. J Pept. Protein Res. </italic></highlight>1991, 37, 487; Sebestyen et al., <highlight><italic>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., </italic></highlight>1993, 3, 413.) In this technique, a mixture of related compounds can be made in the same reaction vessel, thus substantially reducing the number of containers required for the synthesis of very large libraries, such as those containing as many as or more than one million library members. As an example, the solid support scaffolds can be divided into n vessels, where n represents the number species of reagent A to be reacted with the scaffold structures. After reaction, the contents from n vessels are combined and then split into m vessels, where m represents the number of species of reagent B to be reacted with the scaffold structures. This procedure is repeated until the desired number of reagents is reacted with the scaffold structures to yield the inventive library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The quantum dots of the present invention can be readily attached to a solid support. A solid support, for the purposes of this invention, is defined as an insoluble material to which compounds are attached during a synthesis sequence. The use of a solid support is advantageous for the synthesis of libraries because the isolation of support-bound reaction products can be accomplished simply by washing away reagents from the support-bound material and therefore the reaction can be driven to completion by the use of excess reagents. A solid support can be any material which is an insoluble matrix and can have a rigid or semi-rigid surface. Exemplary solid supports include but are not limited to pellets, disks, capillaries, hollow fibers, needles, pins, solid fibers, cellulose beads, pore-glass beads, silica gels, polystyrene beads optionally cross-linked with divinylbenzene, grafted co-poly beads, poly-acyrlamide beads, latex beads, dimethylacrylamide beads optionally crosslinked with N-N&prime;-bis-acryloylethylenediamine, and glass particles coated with a hydrophobic polymer. In one particularly preferred embodiment, a Tentagel amino resin, a composite of 1) a polystyrene bead crosslinked with a divinylbenzene and 2) PEG (polyethylene glycol), is employed for use in the present invention. The quantum dots of the present invention can readily be functionalized with styrene and thus can be incorporated into Tentagel beads, or the quantum dots may be functionalized with a carboxylate moiety and can be readily attached to the Tentagel support having an amine moiety through an amide linkage. Tentagel is a particularly useful solid support because it provides a versatile support for use in on-bead or off-bead assays, and it also undergoes excellent swelling in solvents ranging from toluene to water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The quantum dots therefore identify each reaction stage that an individual solid support has experienced, and records the step in the particular synthesis series, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> depicts the attachment of three different reagents A, B, and C (<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) to a solid support, and the attachment of the identification unit (<highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) to the solid support (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) via a linkage (<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>). The supports are then pooled together (<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) and split for reaction with reagents D, E, and F. Attachment of appropriate identification units for each of these reagents enables the encoding of this particular reaction stage as observed previously for reagents A, B, and C. In this particular embodiment, the tags may be attached to all (or most) of the solid supports immediately before, during, or immediately after the reaction stage, depending on the particular chemistry used in a given reaction sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the beads can be labeled with the quantum dots prior to reaction of the beads with any reagents, and as the beads are split in the split and pool process, the beads are read before being added to a new (split stage) container to keep track of the particular reaction at that particular stage in the synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Once the synthesis is complete, the library of compounds can then be screened for biological activity and the supports having a compound of interest can then be analyzed directly (on-bead analysis) to provide information about the reaction stages and history of the synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Although the method described above is with reference to split and pool combinatorial techniques, one of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the present encoding scheme is not limited to split and pool methods; rather the inventive encoding scheme can be utilized in any combinatorial or other reaction scheme such as parallel synthesis, or synthesis of compounds on an array, to name a few. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Genomics Applications: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In another particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventive system can be utilized to gain information about genetic information from oligonucleotide fragments. In general, it has been desirable to understand genetic variation and its consequences on biological function, and in order to do this, an enormous comparative sequence analysis must be carried out. Because each DNA strand has the capacity to recognize a uniquely complementary sequence through base pairing, the process of recognition, or hybridization, is highly parallel, as every nucleotide in a large sequence can in principle be queried at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> DNA chip technology has been an important tool for genomics applications. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs ) are the most frequently observed class of variations in the human genome. Detecting the differences between alleles of genes is a significant goal of medical research into genetic diseases and disorders. (For example, sickle cell anemia, colon cancer, BRCA1). Current technology has allowed for large scale screening of DNA sequences for mutations in the sequence. This technology involves the creation of DNA &ldquo;chips&rdquo; that contain high-density arrays of DNA sequences (e.g. STSs) covalently bound at specific locations on a surface (glass). A set of four oligonucleotides of identical sequence except for a single base alteration (A, G, T, or C) near the center is used to compare two alleles of a gene. Single nucleotide differences between alleles at the position complementary to altered sites in the set of four oligos will allow one oligo to hybridize preferentially over the other three. Detecting which oligo hybridizes to the sample DNA will then identify the sequence of the polymorphism. By creating sets of these four oligos that are shifted over by one nucleotide each, a researcher can scan a large number of basepairs for single nucleotide polymorphisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The system of the present invention, in contrast to fluorescently labeled probes used in the existing methods, is capable of not only acting as a probe for identification of a desired sequence, but is also capable of encoding information about the sequence itself. Because the inventive identification system is capable of providing both a probe and identifier, ordered arrays are not necessary for accessing genetic information, although the inventive system can still be used in traditional arrays. Instead, a collection of beads, for example, can be assembled with the desired labeled DNA fragments, wherein said beads are also encoded with information about the particular sequence. Upon binding, the oligo that hybridizes to the sample DNA can be detected by scanning the sample to identify the quantum dot labeled probe, while at the same time the sequence information can then be decoded by analyzing the quantum dot &ldquo;barcode&rdquo;. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Until recently, the development of a ligand for a biological receptor has required the iterative synthesis, testing, and modification of individual compounds based on natural product leads or de novo molecular design. The emerging field of combinatorial synthesis shows great promise for streamlining this process, enabling the rapid generation of structurally diverse libraries of up to millions of compounds, which may be screened against a biological receptor (Gordon et al., &ldquo;Applications of Combinatorial Technologies to Drug Discovery. 2. Combinatorial Organic Synthesis, Library Screening Strategies, and Future Directions&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Med. Chem., </italic></highlight>37:1385-1401 (1994); Virgilio et al., &ldquo;Simultaneous Solid-Phase Synthesis of beta-Turn Mimetics Incorporating Side-Chain Functionality&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>116:11580-11581 (1994); Brenner et al., &ldquo;Encoded Combinatorial Chemistry&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>89:5381-5383 (1992); Ohlmeyer et al., &ldquo;Complex Synthetic Chemical Libraries Indexed With Molecular Tags&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>90:10922-10926 (1993); Carell et al., &ldquo;New Promise in Combinatorial Chemistry: Synthesis, Characterization, and Screening of Small-Molecule Libraries in Solution,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Chemistry &amp; Biology, </italic></highlight>2:171-183 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, this approach does not represent a complete solution to the problem of identifying receptor ligands, for several reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> First, unless the library is designed to &ldquo;tune&rdquo; the activity of a lead compound, the proportion of active species relative to the whole is extremely small. This has the effect of rendering detection of the active compounds against the background of inactive compounds problematic, since standard methods of measuring a binding constant are not meaningful when applied to mixtures of compounds. Typically, the detection problem has been addressed by coupling the receptor to a reporter molecule, such as a dye, a fluorescent tag, or a substrate for another, readily detectable protein (e.g., coupling to biotin for detection by a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate). However, these techniques, particularly the two-stage assay process, can change the properties of the receptor of interest, or cause ligands to the secondary receptor rather than the primary receptor to be identified (Devlin et al., &ldquo;Random Peptide Libraries: A Source of Specific Protein Binding Molecules&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>249:404-406 (1990); Lam et al., &ldquo;A New Type of Synthetic Peptide Library for Identifying Ligand-Binding Activity&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>(London), 354:82-84 (1991)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Second, the total amount of active compound present in an assay of this type is generally too small to permit direct structural analysis by spectroscopic means, requiring instead that the compound be identified through the analysis of encoded tags or iterative deconvolution (although some direct methods employing gel-phase NMR or mass spectrometry (Youngquist et al., &ldquo;Generation and Screening of Combinatorial Peptide Libraries Designed for Rapid Sequencing by Mass Spectrometry&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc </italic></highlight>117:3900-3906 (1995) have appeared), and subsequent resynthesis for full characterization. Finally, if library synthesis and evaluation is carried out on solid support, compound behavior is not necessarily transferable to the solution phase. On the other hand, solution-based strategies for library synthesis require that analysis proceed through the time-consuming process of iterative deconvolution (Erb et al., &ldquo;Recursive Deconvolution of Combinatorial Chemical Libraries&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>91:11422-11426 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming these and other deficiencies in the art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a combinatorial library which includes a plurality of at least six different complexes. Each of the complexes is formed of at least one complexing agent and at least two non-biopolymer ligands that are reversibly bonded to the complexing agent, and each different complex in the library has different ligands bonded to the complexing agent. Two ligands which are structurally the same but which have different optical configurations are to be considered &ldquo;different&rdquo; for purposes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a complexing agent is meant to include any atom, group of atoms, or ion that is capable of reversibly binding two or more non-biopolymer ligands. Examples of suitable complexing agents include metal atoms and metal ions, which, as used herein, are meant to include Na, K, Rh, Cs, Fr, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra, Sc, Y, the lanthanides, the actinides, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Tc, Re, Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Hg, B, Al, Ga, In, Tl, Si, Ge, Sb, Pb, P, As, Sb, Bi, Se, Te, Po, and their stable ions. Preferably, the metal or metal ion complexing agent has a valency such that it undergoes fast ligand exchange. Considerations for selecting such preferred metal or metal ion complexing agents based on this criterion are known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and further detail regarding these considerations is are set forth in Cotton et al., <highlight><italic>Advanced Inorganic Chemistry. A Comprehensive Text, </italic></highlight>4th ed., New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons (1980) (&ldquo;Cotton&rdquo;), which is hereby incorporated by reference. For example, since Co(II) undergoes fast ligand exchange while Co(III) does not, the use of Co(II) as a complexing agent is preferred to Co(III) in the practice of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a ligand is meant to include any compound that is capable of reversibly binding to the complexing agent. A non-biopolymer ligand is meant to include any ligand provided that the ligand is not a DNA molecule, an RNA molecule, or a polypeptide. For purposes of the present invention, DNA and RNA molecules are compounds that consist solely of two or more nucleotides linked by phosphodiester bonds, and polypeptides are compounds that consist solely of two or more amino acids linked by amide bonds. Other biologically based compounds, such as cellulose, starches, sugars, and the like are considered to be non-biopolymer compounds for the purposes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Non-biopolymer ligands suitable for use in the practice of the present invention are those which reversibly bind to the complexing agent. Where the complexing agent is a metal atom or metal ion, suitable ligands are those compounds that have at least one functional group capable of bonding to a metal or metal ion. Examples of such functional groups include hydroxyl groups, nitrogen-containing groups (including, e.g., amino groups and heterocyclic nitrogens), carboxyl groups (e.g., ketones, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof) and the like. Illustratively, the following structures represent suitable non-biopolymer ligands:

Amines, alcohols, and thiols that can be used as non-biopolymer ligands in the practice of the present invention can be primary or secondary amines, alcohols, and thiols. Compounds containing two or more of these functional groups (e.g., ethylenediamine) can also be employed.

In addition, the combinatorial library includes at least six different complexes and each different complex in the library has different ligands bonded to the complexing agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> For example, the combinatorial library can include a plurality of complexes, each of which has the formula Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, where Z is a complexing agent capable of reversibly binding to two or more ligands, each A<highlight><superscript>i </superscript></highlight>is a non-biopolymer ligand capable of reversibly binding to Z, and n is an integer equal to two or more and represents the number of non-biopolymer ligands that are bonded to Z. In the above formula, i is an index number which identifies each of the ligands individually (e.g., A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, A<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, A<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, A<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>, etc) and can have values from 1 to n. Each A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>, is independently selected from a group of non-biopolymer ligands having at least three different members.

Stated differently, each of the plurality of complexes can be said to have the formula Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)(A<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>, where A<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and A<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>are non-biopolymer ligands capable of reversibly binding to Z and are independently selected from a group of non-biopolymer ligands having at least three different members. In this case, (A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2 </subscript></highlight>represents the remaining (i.e., other than A<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and A<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) n-2 non-biopolymer ligands that are bonded to Z. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the values of n and i, as used herein, are not to be construed as an indication of the total number of A&apos;s in the group (e.g., ligands in the library) from which the A&apos;s are selected. Instead, n refers to the number of ligands bonded to the complexing agent, and i is an index number for each of those ligands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, each non-biopolymer ligand is independently selected from a group of non-biopolymer ligands having at least three different members. For purposes of illustration, the at least three different members from which each non-biopolymer ligand is independently selected will be designated B1, B2, and B3. Thus, when n non-biopolymer ligands are bonded to Z, the combinatorial library can include complexes having the formulae Z(B1)(B1)(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>, Z(B1)(B2)(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>, Z(B1)(B3)(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>, Z(B2)(B2)(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>, Z(B2)(B3)(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>, and Z(B3)(B3)(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>. For example, when n is 2, the combinatorial library includes complexes having the formulae Z(B1)(B1), Z(B1)(B2), Z(B1)(B3), Z(B2)(B2), Z(B2)(B3), and Z(B3)(B3). While the minimum number of members in the group from which non-biopolymers are selected is 3, this number can be higher (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more). For example, when the number of members in the group from which non-biopolymers are selected is 4 (e.g., B1, B2, B3, and B4) and the number of non-biopolymer ligands bound to each Z is 2, the combinatorial library can include complexes having the formulae Z(B1)(B1), Z(B1)(B2), Z(B1)(B3), Z(B1)(B4), Z(B2)(B2), Z(B2)(B3), Z(B2)(B4), Z(B3)(B3) Z(B3)(B4), and Z(B4)(B4). Generally when the number of members in the group from which non-biopolymers are selected is m (e.g., B 1, B2, B3, . . . Bm), and the number of non-biopolymer ligands bound to each Z is 2, the combinatorial library will contain (m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;m)/2 different complexes. As indicated above, the minimum number of non-biopolymer ligands which are bound to each Z is 2. However, depending on the nature of Z and of the non-biopolymer ligands present, the number of non-biopolymer ligands which are bound to each Z can be greater than 2 (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more). For purposes of the present invention, a ligand bonded to Z is counted only once, even if it is bonded through two or more groups (such as where the ligand is a bidentate, tridentate, or tetradentate ligand). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Also included in the meaning of non-biopolymer ligands, A, are moieties having the formula &mdash;A&prime;Z&prime;(Q), where A&prime; is a pluridentate (i.e., bidentate, tridentate, etc.) non-biopolymer ligand, Z&prime; is a second complexing agent that is identical to or different than Z, and Q represents one or more non-biopolymer ligands. Thus, for example, when each Z is bonded to two non-biopolymer ligands (i.e., n&equals;2) selected from a group of ligands containing at least one pluridentate (i.e., bidentate, tridentate, etc.) ligand, A&prime;, and other ligands, the combinatorial library of the present invention can contain complexes having the formula:</paragraph>

Thus, for example, suitable complexes are those which can undergo ligand exchange. Preferred complexes are those where Z and each A are selected so that the reactions Z(A&prime;)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&rarr;Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>and Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>&rarr;Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;A<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>each have a rate constant of greater than about 2 per second, more preferably, greater than about 4 per second, and, most preferably, greater than about 10 per second. Rate constants for these reactions can be measured by conventional methods, which are well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by the methods described in Cotton, particularly in Chapter 28, which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As indicated above the combinatorial libraries of the present invention contain at least six different complexes. For purposes of the present invention, two complexes are different if one complex contains a ligand which is not present in the other complex. As one skilled in the art will recognize the number of complexes in the combinatorial library will depend on the number of ligands present in the group of ligands from which the ligands are selected and on the number of ligands which can bind to a single complexing agent. Preferably, the combinatorial library contains at least about 20 different complexes; more preferably, the combinatorial library contains at least about 40 different complexes; still more preferably, the combinatorial library contains at least about 60 different complexes; still more preferably, the combinatorial library contains at least about 100 different complexes; still more preferably, the combinatorial library contains at least about 250 different complexes; and most preferably, the combinatorial library contains at least about 500 different complexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a composition which includes a combinatorial library and a receptor in contact with the combinatorial library. Combinatorial libraries suitable for the practice of the present invention include those described hereinabove. Suitable receptors include, for example, biological receptors, such as, DNA molecules, RNA molecules, oligosaccharides, whole cells or fragments thereof, proteins and other polypeptides, and polymers. Typically, the receptor will be one having particular biological interest, for example, a particular protein, RNA molecule, or DNA molecule that is linked to the occurrence of a particular disease, disease state, or condition. Many such proteins, RNA molecules, or DNA molecules are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The receptor is in contact with the combinatorial library. Typically, this is achieved by dissolving or suspending the constituent parts of the combinatorial library in a suitable medium (e.g., water or a buffered aqueous solution) which is in contact with the receptor. The receptor can be also dissolved or suspended in the medium or it can be immobilized on a solid support, such as cellulose or related resins. Advantageously, the receptor is immobilized on a solid support material that is packed into a column, and the combinatorial library is suspended or dissolved in a medium (e.g., water or a buffered aqueous solution) which is present in the column and in contact with the solid support material on which the receptor is immobilized. Immobilization of biological receptors on solid supports can be carried out using conventional methods, which are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, where temperature or light sensitive biological receptors are employed, appropriate measures should be taken to prevent denaturation of these biological materials. Upon initial contact of the receptor with the combinatorial library, few if any of the receptors will be bound by the complexes contained in the library; however, over time, an increasing number of the receptors will be bound by these complexes. Thus, the composition of the present invention may contain receptors which are bound to complexes contained in the combinatorial library. Generally, one skilled in the art will be able to predict the types of ligands which will bind to a particular biological receptor, and the combinatorial library will be designed accordingly. For example, where the biological receptor is a DNA molecule, one skilled in the art would identify DNA intercalators or major or minor groove binders as suitable ligands for construction of the combinatorial library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The combinatorial libraries of the present invention are useful for identifying a combination of non-biopolymer ligands which binds preferentially to a receptor, such as a biological receptor, examples of which include those provided above.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The method includes providing a combinatorial library of the present invention, such as one of the combinatorial libraries described hereinabove, and contacting the combinatorial library with a receptor under conditions effective to preferentially bind a fraction of the plurality of complexes present in the combinatorial library to the receptor. Generally, the combinatorial library is present as a suspension or solution in water or some other suitable solvent, and the receptor is either dissolved or suspended in the water or other suitable solvent or immobilized, for example, on a suitable resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Contacting is carried out under conditions which are effective to preferentially bind a fraction of the plurality of complexes present in the combinatorial library. For example, the temperature at which the contacting is carried out is preferably between about 0&deg; C. and 40&deg; C., although other temperatures can be employed so long as the biological receptor is stable at these temperatures and so long the ligand exchange rates (i.e., the rate at which the reactions Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&rarr;Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>and Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>&rarr;Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>&plus;A<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>occur) remain reasonably fast (preferably greater than about 2 per second). Physiologically relevant conditions (e.g., about 1-100 mM N-(2-hydroxytethyl)piperazine-N&prime;(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (&ldquo;HEPES&rdquo;), about 10-1000 mM KCl, and pH from about 7 to about 8) are generally suitable conditions for carrying out the contacting step of the method of the present invention, especially where biological receptors are involved. The time period for which the combinatorial library and receptor is contacted can vary, but, generally, longer times give rise to better results in terms of the fraction of receptors that are bound to the preferentially-bound complex. Suitable time periods for maintaining contact between the combinatorial library and receptor are from about 10 minutes to about 5 days, preferably from about 1 hour to about 8 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As a result of the above-described method, the receptors are preferentially bound (preferably, substantially exclusively bound) to the complex having the highest affinity (i.e., the greatest equilibrium constant) therefor. Most if not all other complexes remain unbound. A complex can be considered to be preferentially bound to a receptor if, after equilibrium is established, the complex occupies greater than about 50%, preferably, greater than about 75%, and more preferably, greater than about 90% of the available receptor sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Although not wishing to be bound by the following proposed explanation, applicants believe that the observed phenomenon can be explained by virtue of the fact that the binding between the ligands and the complexing agent is reversible, thus permitting ligands to exchange in response to perturbations in the ligand/complexing agent equilibrium. By adding a receptor, however, an additional equilibration ensues. This equilibration involves the binding of the complexes to the receptor with varying degrees of affinity. Since some complexes bind with higher affinity than others, those complexes would be depleted from the pool of equilibrating complexes. By simple mass balance rules, the equilibrium would then have to shift in favor of complexes that bind to the receptor, effectively using the thermodynamics of ligand-receptor binding to direct the synthesis of the complex having the highest affinity for the receptor. In the end, assuming there is sufficient amounts of the ligands necessary to produce a sufficient amount of highest affinity complex, the receptor is saturated with the highest affinity complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The preferentially bound complex can then be identified or characterized, such as by conventional methods (GC-MS, HPLC, etc). Typically, this involves separating the preferentially bound complex from the other complexes that are in the combinatorial library. Since the preferentially bound complex is attached to the receptor, this is generally achieved by separating the receptor (with preferentially bound receptor attached thereto) from the other complexes that are in the combinatorial library. In the cases where the receptor is immobilized, for example, as described above, such separation can be readily achieved, for example, by elution, filtration, and the like. In cases where the receptor is suspended or dissolved in a medium (e.g., a solvent) containing the other complexes in the combinatorial library, separation can be effected by filtration, polyethylene glycol precipitation, and the like. Once separation is achieved, the preferentially bound complex can be readily identified using conventional characterization methods. In some cases, it may be advantageous to separate the preferentially bound complex from the receptor to which it is bound. This can be effected by denaturation of the receptor or by elution from the receptor. Preferably, such a separation should be carried out under conditions which disfavor ligand exchange. In some situations, this can be achieved by changing the oxidation state of the metal complexing agent so that, after the change, the metal complexing agent is non-labile (i.e., undergoes ligand exchange very slowly). Further detail with regard to controlling the lability of a complexing agent is set forth in Cotton, particularly in Chapter 28, which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The combinatorial libraries described and used above can be prepared by the following method to which the present invention also relates. In this method, one part (by mole) of a complexing agent, Z (or a salt thereof), is contacted with m<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>parts of A<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and m<highlight><superscript>i </superscript></highlight>parts of A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>. A<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and each A<highlight><superscript>i </superscript></highlight>are non-biopolymer ligands, examples of which are described hereinabove; i is an integer from 2 to k; k is an integer equal to or greater than 3 and represents the number of members in the group of different non-biopolymer ligands from which the non-biopolymer ligands are selected; and the sum of m<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and &Sgr;m<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>from i&equals;2 to k equals n. For example, where the ligands are selected from a group of 4 different ligands (i.e., k&equals;4), these ligands can be identified as A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, A<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, A<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, and A<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>. Each of A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, A<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, A<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, and A<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>, are present in amounts (expressed in parts by mole) of m<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, and m<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>, respectively, and the sum of m<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, and m<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>is equal to n. Generally, the amounts of the different non-biopolymer ligands in the reaction mixture will be substantially the same. Illustratively, returning to the above example and assuming that the number of ligands which bind to each complexing agent is 2, each of m<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, and m<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>can be about 0.5. The complexing agent and non-biopolymer ligands are contacted under conditions effective to form a substantially statistical mixture of complexes. Suitable conditions are those which permit equilibriums to be established between the various ligands and the complexing agent. Typically, this involves carrying out the reaction at a temperature of from about 0&deg; C. and 100&deg; C., preferably about room temperature, for a time sufficient for equilibration to occur (e.g., about 10 minutes to about 5 days, preferably about 1 to about 2 hours). Either or both of the ligands and complexing agent can be present as a suspension or as a solution, but the latter is preferred. Although it is not generally necessary, the statistical proportions of the various complexes in the resulting combinatorial library can be calculated based on the equilibrium constants of Z and each different ligand and the proportions of the different ligands present in the mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The combinatorial libraries described and used above can also be prepared by the following alternative method to which the present invention also relates. In this method, a complex, Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, is contacted with two or more complexes Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>under conditions effective to form a substantially statistical mixture of Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. A<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and each A<highlight><superscript>i </superscript></highlight>are non-biopolymer ligands; i is an integer from 2 to k; and k is an integer equal to or greater than 3 and represents the number of members in the group of different non-biopolymer ligands from which the ligands A<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and A<highlight><superscript>i </superscript></highlight>are selected. In this embodiment, each of the n A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&apos;s in Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is the same, and each of the n A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>&apos;s in each Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>is the same. The Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>complexes are contacted under conditions effective to form a substantially statistical mixture of complexes. Suitable conditions are those which permit the ligands on the Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>to re-equilibrate. Such conditions include carrying out the reaction at a temperature of from about 0&deg; C. and 100&deg; C., preferably about room temperature; carrying out the reaction in a common solvent, for example, water or a buffered aqueous solution; and carrying out the reaction for a time sufficient for re-equilibration to occur (e.g., about 10 minutes to about 5 days, preferably about 1 to about 2 hours). Either or both of the Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>can be present as a suspension or as a solution, but the latter is preferred. Although it is not generally necessary, the statistical proportions of the various complexes in the resulting combinatorial library can be calculated based on the equilibrium constants of Z and each different ligand and the proportions of the various Z(A<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and Z(A<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>initially in the mixture. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Results </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Average results for derivatized amines from initial elutions are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For each case, areas for eluted peaks in the set of zinc-free samples (164 &mgr;M each amine, 82 &mgr;M salicylaldehyde, no Zn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>) were used to normalize all other values. A significant reduction in the amount of derivatized N-methyl 2-aminoethyl pyrrolidine (4) was observed from the three replicate experiments containing both salicylaldehyde and 41 &mgr;M Zn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>. Similarly, a large (i.e.,&gt;50%) reduction in the amount of 3-hydroxypropylamine (6) was observed under these conditions. An unidentified impurity unfortunately obscured a peak corresponding to 5-naphthylamide, preventing the evaluation of the role of 5 in the library. Comparison with the initial elutions from unfunctionalized cellulose resin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) indicates similar levels of retention of 6 but not 4. A slight (ca. 20%) reduction in the amount of 2-aminomethylfuran (1) in salicylaldehyde and 41 &mgr;M Zn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-containing libraries eluted from DNA-cellulose resin was observed. This may indicate a slight affinity of complexes containing 1 for DNA. These data indicate that zinc complexes incorporating salicylaldehyde and N-methyl 2-aminoethylpyrrolidine (4) have the highest affinity for oligo (dA&bull;dT) at the relative concentrations tested. Libraries containing higher (82 &mgr;M) concentrations of Zn<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus; gave markedly different results from those incorporating 41 &mgr;M Zn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>. Most notably, a significant reduction in the amount of 4 retained on the column was observed. One likely explanation for this observation is that the added zinc changes the population of complexes present in the library. However, it is not known at present what the precise structural reasons for this might be. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> strong dependence of the UV spectra of mixtures of salicylaldehyde and N-methyl 2-aminoethyl pyrrolidine (4) in HEPES buffer on the concentration of Zn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> has been observed. However, the concentrations of Zn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> evaluated in these UV titrations which caused the inverse parabolic variations observed were 10-fold higher than those employed in the present affinity experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> To verify that the presence of zinc was not producing artifacts in the ability to derivatize samples, control libraries, 164 &mgr;M in each amine, 82 &mgr;M in salicylaldehyde, and 0 or 41 &mgr;M in Zn<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>, were prepared. After allowing these libraries to incubate in solution (i.e., without contact with any sort of resin) for 6 hours, the libraries were lyophilized, derivatized, and analyzed in an identical manner to samples from selection experiments. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, differences in peak volumes for libraries prepared in the presence or absence of Zn<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus; are less than 10%, with the exception of 3-methoxypropylamine (3). In each case, the differences could be due to experimental error, participation of Zn<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus; in the acylation reaction, or by Zn<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;-accelerated partial reversion by hydrolyzed complexes to imines prior to acylation. These results also suggest that differences in peak volumes for derivatized amines that are greater than 10% are probably significant, with the exception of 3-methoxypropylamine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A potentially more desirable method of identifying the library constituents with the highest affinity would be to remove them from the receptor in some manner following the initial elution of &ldquo;non-binding&rdquo; components for subsequent derivatization and analysis. It was assumed that simply washing the DNA resin with water would be sufficient to denature the receptor, since low-salt conditions are known to cause DNA melting. However, only small amounts of derivatized amines from wash solutions were observed, with no experimentally significant differences among experiments or between DNA-cellulose (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and control cellulose (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) resins. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Rather than forming the imine constituents of the ligands from a mixture of salicylaldehyde and amines, the imines can be pre-formed, as set forth below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The experimental design is shown in schematic form in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Introduction of a transition metal salt (&ldquo;M&rdquo;) to a pool of compounds (&ldquo;monomers&rdquo;) capable of forming coordination compounds with M should initiate a series of equilibria among various combinations of complexes. Assuming ligand exchange is reasonably fast, this equilibration permits all combinatiorally possible coordination complexes to be populated. By adding a receptor covalently linked to a solid support (an affinity resin), however, an additional equilibration ensues involving the binding of coordination compounds to the receptor with varying degrees of affinity. Since some compounds might be expected to bind with higher affinity, those compounds would be depleted from the pool of equilibrating complexes. By simple mass balance rules, the equilibrium would then have to shift in favor of compounds that bind to the receptor, effectively utilizing the receptor as a catalyst for the synthesis of its own ligand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> While this concept could easily be applied to any type of biopolymer or other &ldquo;receptor&rdquo;, double-stranded DNA was chosen as the initial target, for a number of reasons. First, the design and synthesis of sequence-selective DNA-binding agents is a problem of continuing fundamental and medical importance. (For example, see Trauger et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>118:6160-6166 (1996) and references therein, which are hereby incorporated by reference.) Second, the ladder-like structure of DNA is ideally suited to the application of a modular, self-assembly strategy. Finally, several oligonucleotide affinity resins are available commercially, allowing the experimental details of initial selection strategies to be determined without the need for costly oligonucleotide and affinity resin synthesis. As &ldquo;monomers&rdquo;, the readily available salicylaldimines 7, which have the following formula:

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> were synthesized condensation of salicylaldehyde and commercially available amines. The synthesis and characterization of 8 have been previously described in Inouye, <highlight><italic>S. Chem. Pharm. Bull., </italic></highlight>15:1540-1546 (1967), which is hereby incorporated by reference. The synthesis and characterization of compound 10 have been previously described in Duran et al., <highlight><italic>Synth. React. Inorg. Met.-Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>17:681-683 (1987), which is hereby incorporated by reference, and in Ramesh et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Soc. Dalton</italic></highlight>, pp. 83-86 (1992), which is hereby incorporated by reference. The synthetic procedures for 8, 10, 11, and 13 are set forth below in Example 10. Given that compounds 9 and 11 were synthesized in racemic form, a combinatorial library formed from these six salicylaldimines could be expected to provide a maximum of 36 unique bis(salicylaldiminato)zinccomplexes. These compounds were chosen in part because millimolar solutions of each could be prepared in buffered aqueous solution with 1% DMSO as cosolvent, a finding important to their successful utilization in a combinatorial library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Although the ability of bis(salicylaldiminato)-zinc(Blackborow et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Res., </italic></highlight>119 (1978), which is hereby incorporated by reference) and -nickel (Schepartz et al., <highlight><italic>J. Am.Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>111:5976-6977 (1989), which is hereby incorporated by reference) complexes to self-assemble in halogenated solvents is well known, we felt it was important to verify that this could also occur in aqueous solution before attempting to construct a -combinatorial library. Therefore, the dependence of the proton NMR spectrum for 12 on ZnCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>concentration in D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was examined. Characteristic of slow-exchange phenomena, substantial line broadening of aromatic, and, to a lesser extent, side-chain resonances, is observable on addition of substoichiometric quantities of ZnCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. In addition, chemical shifts change markedly. All peaks coalesce into a single set of sharply defined resonances as excess zinc is added. These observations do not provide high-resolution structural information about these complexes. Therefore, it is conceivable that the structure in solution is an addition complex (containing two salicylaldimines coordinated to ZnCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) rather than a chelate (see Bottino et al., <highlight><italic>Zeitschrift fur Kristallographie, </italic></highlight>187:71-77 (1989), which is hereby incorporated by reference). However, these observations do indicate that complexation between the salicylaldimine and Zn<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus; occurs, providing a single coordinated species. It was also observed that the addition of ZnCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to a solution of an amine and salicylaldehyde in water can induce imine formation followed by complexation. This suggests that a three-stage equilibrium process could be constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A serious potential problem with the selection and amplification of a single compound from an equilibrating mixture of complexes is that of identifying the desired high-affinity species. First, if the selection is not complete for a single compound, the separation and identification of a potentially large number of complexes presents a significant analytical challenge. Furthermore, since reequilibration of complexes can occur once the affinity resin is removed, it might be expected that binding information would be lost. However, we found that hydrolysis of mixtures of complexes with trifluoroacetic acid followed by neutralization and derivatization with excess 2-naphthoyl chloride provided a mixture of amide derivatives that was readily separable by standard reverse-phase HPLC. Application of this technique to the eluent from an affinity column would permit deconvolution of the library to provide information about the identity of binding complexes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> With a series of monomers, verification of self-assembly in aqueous solutions, and a separation method in hand, the experimental tools were in place to conduct an affinity selection and amplification experiment. A standard solution of 0.5 mM 8-13 (total concentration 3 mM in &ldquo;monomer&rdquo;) was prepared in 10 mM Tris&bull;HCl, 100 mM KCl, 1% DMSO, pH 7.5. To determine the effect of zinc on the observed selection, samples were prepared either with or without 26 MM ZnCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Samples were allowed to incubate for one hour to allow an equilibrium mixture of complexes to form, and the latter were then individually added to affinity columns prepared from 30 mg of commercial poly(dT)-cellulose resin (Pharmacia Biotech) preincubated with one A<highlight><subscript>260 </subscript></highlight>unit (approximately 7 nmol) of oligo (dA)<highlight><subscript>12-18</subscript></highlight>(Oligo (dA)<highlight><subscript>12-18 </subscript></highlight>as obtained from Pharmacia Biotech is a mixture of homopolymeric, single-stranded DNA of length 12 to 18) in 10 mM Tris&bull;HCl, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.5 for formation of double-stranded DNA (giving an approximate, average complex:base pair ratio of 85:1). Following a two-hour incubation of the libraries on the resin, solutions were eluted, lyophilized, and derivatized as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the results of affinity selection and amplification of our initial self-assembled combinatorial library. With data normalized to values observed in the absence of zinc, it is clear that monomers 9 and 11 are most strongly retained on the affinity column in the presence of zinc (i.e., less of these monomers is observed following elution and derivatization). The observation that twice as much of derivatized monomer 12 is eluted from the affinity column in the presence of zinc as in the absence of zinc suggests that this monomer participates in some kind of binding interaction with double-stranded oligo(dA)-oligo(dT)in the absence of zinc that is not available to either the 12-Zn-12 complex, or other complexes incorporating monomer 7. These results would then require deconvolution of three possibilities for the strongest binding complex: 9-Zn-9, 11-Zn-11, and 9-Zn-11 (including all stereoisomers) would all be candidates. However, results of control experiments rendered this question moot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> To ensure that selections observed were based on differential affinity for double-stranded DNA, rather than interactions with single-stranded DNA or with the underlying cellulose support, control experiments were conducted using single-stranded oligo(dT)-cellulose, and cellulose alone, under conditions identical to those for the double-stranded experiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, monomer 9 is retained on cellulose or oligo(dT)-cellulose to the same extent in the presence or absence of zinc, while 11 is more strongly retained on cellulose in the presence of zinc. This suggests that two out of the three possibilities for the strongest binding complex to double-stranded DNA (11-Zn-11 and 1 1-Zn-9) do not need to be considered, leaving 9-Zn-9 as likely the tightest DNA-binding complex. Other monomers are generally retained more strongly to single-stranded oligo(dT) cellulose in the absence of zinc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In order to verify that the results of the affinity selection experiment accurately reflected differences in binding affinities, UV binding titrations (as described in Krugh, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>69:1911-1914 (1972)) were conducted for homodimeric complexes 10-Zn-10 (a presumed weak- or non-binding complex) and 9-Zn-9 (a presumed strong-binding complex). Since both of these complexes have strong UV absorbances in the range of 290-350 nm while poly(dA)-poly(dT) does not, the concentration of complex was held constant in the presence of varying concentrations of DNA in each case. Using commercially available poly(dA)-poly(dT), saturable binding was observable in each case. While any analysis of binding constants for these complexes is complicated by the homopolymeric, variable-length nature of the DNA used (providing multiple, identical binding sites), 9-Zn-9 bound to DNA with an apparent K<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of 1.11 micromolar, significantly stronger than 10-Zn-10 (27.8 micromolar). A simple affinity selection experiment conducted as described above, but utilizing only monomers 9 and 10, further corroborated these observations. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the ratio of derivatized 10:9 eluted following incubation on double-stranded oligo(dT)-cellulose doubles on addition of zinc. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is concerned with modulating the drug resistance pathways of cells in order to either confer or overcome resistance to certain drug molecules. In the context of the present invention, &ldquo;drug&rdquo; is a term that encompasses chemicals with biological activity to alter the physiology of a biological organism or its cells in some way. In such broad terms, &ldquo;drug&rdquo; can be used to include chemicals with activity on animals as well as plants, wherein drugs can be classified as pesticides, including but is not limited to herbicides, nematocides, insecticides, fungicides, algaecides, miticides and rodenticides. Modulation of drug resistance entails modulation of an extra-cellular phosphatase (ecto-phosphatase) and an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter in order to achieve the desired effect on drug resistance. Stimulation of the ecto-phosphatase either alone or together with stimulation of the ABC transporter yields an increased resistance to drug molecules while inhibition of the ecto-phosphatase alone or together with the ABC transporter yields reduced resistance to the drug molecule. Drug resistance is achieved through the altering of the ATP gradient across biological membranes which is effectuated through the modulation of an ecto-phosphatase either alone or together with an ABC transporter molecule. Modulation of drug resistance as described herein is useful in conferring herbicide resistance to plants; promoting pesticidal and herbicidal activity either alone or in combination with other pesticidal and herbicidal products; conferring drug resistance to microorganisms and tissue culture cells; reducing drug resistance in tumor cells for improved chemotherapy applications; reducing resistance to antibiotics, antifungal agents, and other drugs in microorganisms for the treatment of infections and disease, and methods for identifying inhibitors of ecto-phosphatases. The present invention is directed to pesticides and herbicides whose activity is due to modulation of ecto-phosphatase and ABC transporter activity in cells and modification of membrane transport, which specifically alters the ATP gradient across biological membranes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Cells can use a phenomenon called symport to move soluble products across biological membranes. Symport is a form of coupled movement of two solutes in the same direction across a membrane by a single carrier. Examples of proton and sodium-linked symport systems are found in nearly all living systems. The energetics of the transport event depend on the relative size and electrical nature of the gradient of solutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Transport processes have been classified on the basis of their energy-coupling mechanisms. Currently there are four classifications: (1) Primary Active Transport which uses either a chemical, light or electrical energy source, (2) Group Translocation which uses chemical energy sources, (3) Secondary Active Transport which uses either a sodium or proton electrochemical gradient energy source, and (4) Facilitated Diffusion which does not require an energy source. Meyers, R. A., 1997, <highlight><italic>Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine </italic></highlight>6:125-133. The present invention is related to transport molecules belonging to the first class of transport processes, primary active transport, and therefore, this type of transport will be discussed in further detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Primary active transport refers to a process whereby a &ldquo;primary&rdquo; source of energy is used to drive the active accumulation of a solute into or extrusion of a solute from a cell. Transport proteins include P-type ATPases and ABC-type ATPases. These types of transport systems are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The bacterial ABC-type transporters, which are ATP-driven solute pumps, have eukaryotic counterparts. Additionally, many transmembrane solute transport proteins exhibit a common structural motif. The proteins in these families consist of units or domains that pass through the membrane six times, each time as an &agr;-helix. This has led to the suggestion that many transport proteins share a common evolutionary origin, but this is not true of several distinct families of transport proteins. Numerous structurally distinct bacterial permeases, as well as several homologous eukaryotic transport systems, share a common organization. Meyers, R. A., 1997, <highlight><italic>Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine </italic></highlight>6:125-133. Two hydrophilic domains or proteins function to couple ATP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm to activate substrate uptake or efflux, and two hydrophobic domains or proteins function as the transmembrane substrate channels. These proteins or protein domains constitute what is referred to as the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily. Either the two hydrophilic domains or proteins or the two hydrophobic domains or proteins (or both) may exist either as heterodimers or homodimers. If, as in most bacterial systems, each of these constituents is a distinct protein, then either one or two genes will code for them, depending on whether both are homodimers, one is a homodimer and one is a heterodimer, or both are heterodimers, respectively. The best characterized of the eukaryotic proteins included in this family are the multidrug-resistance (MDR) transporter and the cystic fibrosis related chloride ion channel of mammalian cells (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or CFTR). Meyers, R. A., 1997, <highlight><italic>Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine </italic></highlight>6:125-133. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a general term that refers to the phenotype of cells or microorganisms that exhibit resistance to different, chemically dissimilar, cytotoxic compounds. MDR can develop after sequential or simultaneous exposure to various drugs. MDR can also develop before exposure to many compounds to which a cell or microorganism may be found to be resistant. MDR which develops before exposure is frequently due to a genetic event which causes the altered expression and/or mutation of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Wadkins, R. M. and Roepe, P. D., 1997, <highlight><italic>International Review of Cytology </italic></highlight>171:121-165. This is true for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Id. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One prominent member of the ABC family, P-glycoprotein (Pgp; also known as multidrug resistance protein or MDR1), which is a plasma-membrane glycoprotein that confers a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype on cells, is of considerable interest because it provides one mechanism of possibly inhibiting resistance in tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Senior, A E. et al., 1995, <highlight><italic>FEBS Letters </italic></highlight>377:285-289. Pgp is a single polypeptide of &tilde;1280 amino acids with the typical ABC transporter structure profile. Studies have shown that over-expression of Pgp is responsible for the ATP-dependent extrusion of a variety of compounds, including chemotherapeutic drugs, from cells. Abraham, E. H. et al., 1993, <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90:312-316. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Over one-hundred ABC transporters have been identified in species ranging from <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>to humans. Higgins C. F., 1995, <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>82:693-696. For example, the bacteria <highlight><italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic></highlight>expresses an ABC transporter, LmrA, which mediates antibiotic resistance by extruding amphiphilic compounds from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. van Veen H. W. et al., 1998, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>391:291-295. Furthermore, over-expression of LmrA can confer MDR in human lung fibroblasts and LmrA has similar molecular and biochemical properties to Pgp. Id. This demonstrates that bacterial LmrA and Pgp are functionally interchangeable. Id. Additionally, the plant <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>encodes an ATP transporter, AtPGP-1, which is a putative Pgp homolog. Dudler, R. and Hertig, C., 1992, <highlight><italic>Journal of Biological Chemistry </italic></highlight>267:5882-5888. Similarly, the yeast <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>equivalent of Pgp, STS1 (Bissinger, P. H and Kucher, K., 1994, <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>269:4180-4186), has been cloned and shown to confer multidrug resistance when over-expressed in yeast. Equivalent results have been shown in the yeast Pdr5p, which has recently been shown to be very similar or identical to STSI. (Kolacskowski et al., 1996, <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>271:31543-31548). Taken together, these results suggest that this type of multidrug resistance efflux pump is conserved from bacteria to humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> While various theories of ABC transporter function have become popular, there is still no precise molecular-level description for the mechanism by which over-expression lowers intracellular accumulation of drugs, in particular how Pgp lowers intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, it has been shown that Pgp over-expression also changes plasma membrane electrical potential and intracellular pH which could potentially greatly affect the cellular flux of a large number of compounds to which Pgp confers resistance. Randy M. Wadkins and Paul D. Roepe, 1997, <highlight><italic>International Review of Cytology </italic></highlight>171:121-165. Also included in the ABC transporter superfamily are the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) and the Sulfonyl Urea Receptor (SUR). CFTR and SUR are expressed in the lung epithelium and the &bgr; cells of the pancreas, respectively, as well as in other tissues. CFTR functions as a low conductance ATP and cyclic AMP-dependent Cl<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> channel that also appears to have additional important functions, such as modulation of epithelial Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> conductance and regulation of outwardly rectified chloride channels. Wadkins, R. M. and Roepe, P. D., 1997, <highlight><italic>International Review of Cytology </italic></highlight>171:121-165. Mutations in the CFTR gene produce altered CFTR proteins with defects in CFTR function, leading to profound alterations in epithelial salt transport and altered mucous properties in cystic fibrosis patients that result in chronic lung infections associated with the disease. Id. SUR is triggered by sulfonyl urea drugs to depolarize pancreatic &bgr; cells that leads to Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> influx, which stimulates fusion of insulincontaining vesicles to the plasma membrane. Id. An ATP transporter hypothesis has been suggested for Pgp, CFTR and SUR which theorizes that these ABC transporters function as ATP transport channels. Abraham, E. H. et al, 1993, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90:312-316; Schweibert, E. M., 1995, <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>81:1063-1073; and Al-Awqati, Q., 1995, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>269:805-806. The ATP channel hypothesis, however, has been viewed with skepticism. This is partly due to the inability to show the same results with preparations including purified and reconstituted CFTR, suggesting that the ATP conductance that was originally observed may have been mediated by another protein, not present in the purified system, that is influenced by CFTR. Wadkins, R. M. and Roepe, P. D., 1997, <highlight><italic>International Review of Cytology </italic></highlight>171:121-165. There has been no such negative data reported with respect to the ATP channel hypothesis for Pgp or SUR, but the controversy over CFTR has raised doubt for Pgp and SUR as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In support of the ATP channel hypothesis, Huang et al. (<highlight><italic>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </italic></highlight>182:836-843 (1992)) have suggested that extracellular ATP leads to elevations in pH, and Weiner et al. (<highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>261:4529-4534 (1986)) have suggested that extracellular ATP may regulate Na<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>/H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> exchange in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. It has also been observed that changes in Pgp levels affects pH and plasma membrane electrical potentials which could be connected to recent observations suggesting the involvement of ATP transport in MDR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Additionally, Abraham et al. (<highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90:312-316 (1993)) have reported that the addition of extracellular ATP to MDR cell lines confers sensitivity to drugs abolishing MDR. The data for this effect were not presented in the article and no further explanation was given for this phenomenon. Furthermore, there have been no subsequent publications addressing or explaining this effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, Ujhazy et al. (<highlight><italic>Int. J. Cancer </italic></highlight>68:493-500 (1996)) have shown that ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase is up-regulated in certain MDR cell lines. Ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase is the final enzyme in the extracellular pathway for salvage of adenosine from phosphorylated purines. Zimmerman H., 1992, <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>285:345-365. The proposed hypothesis for the involvement of ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase in drug resistance considers its role in the maintenance of intracellular ATP pools through the adenosine salvage pathway. Ujhazy et al., 1996, <highlight><italic>Int. J. Cancer </italic></highlight>68:493-500. Ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase specifically acts in adenosine salvage pathways, converting AMP to adenosine which is more readily taken up by the cell and utilized as a precursor for ATP production. Therefore, ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase may be acting in certain MDR cell lines as a mechanism by which the cell circumvents the loss of ATP (due to up-regulated transport proteins which possibly form ATP transport channels) by creating higher levels of adenosine from which the cell can produce ATP. Correspondingly, 63% of MDR cell line variants tested expressed ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase. These observations suggested that a salvage mechanism for extracellular nucleotides may be another way by which certain MDR cells counterbalance their ATP losses from efflux induced by the over-expression of ABC transporters involved in MDR. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibitors of ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase conferred sensitivity to certain drugs in MDR cell lines which over-express the ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is also interesting to note that yeast, which do not have an adenosine salvage pathway (Boyum, R. and Guidotti, G., 1997, <highlight><italic>Microbiology </italic></highlight>143:1901-1908), do contain a Pgp-like gene called STS1 (Bissinger, P. H. and Kucher, K., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269:4180-4186). Therefore, since the adenosine salvage pathway is unlikely to be involved in yeast multidrug resistance, other mechanisms are likely to exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Recent reports have confirmed the existence of ATP in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of both multicellular organisms and unicellular organisms. Sedaa, K. et al., 1990, <highlight><italic>J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. </italic></highlight>252:1060-1067 and Boyum, R. and Guidotti, G., 1997, <highlight><italic>Microbiology </italic></highlight>143:1901-1908, respectively. However, no such reports are available which suggest the existence of ATP in the ECM of plants before the present invention. These reports have prompted further investigations of the fate of ATP outside the cell. One of the largest gradients in biological systems is that of ATP. It is a million-fold more concentrated inside the cell than outside. Apyrases are enzymes whose unifying characteristic is their ability to hydrolyze the gamma phosphate of ATP and to a lesser extent, the beta phosphate of ADP. Plesner, L., 1995, <highlight><italic>Int. Rev. Cyto. </italic></highlight>158:141-214. Most apyrases are expressed as plasma membrane associated proteins with their hydrolytic activity facing into the ECM. Wang, T. and Guidotti, G., 1996, <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>271:9898-9901. Extracellular apyrases are generally referred to as ecto-apyrases. Given reports that show the existence of extracellular ATP, one observation regarding ecto-apyrase is that it hydrolyzes the extracellular ATP. In fact, work in animal systems has shown that apyrases hydrolyze ATP in the ECM as part of the adenosine salvage pathway con-jointly with ecto-5&prime; ectonucleotidase. Che, M., 1992, <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>267:9684-9688. The existence of a similar ecto-apyrase system has not been reported in plants prior to the present invention. Additionally, ecto-apyrases have not been shown, prior to the present invention, to have a role in MDR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> While some references appear to indicate that MDR may act at the level of ATP transport, the role of ATP in MDR has not been adequately elucidated and has remained a point of contention in the field. The present invention provides insight into the role of ATP transport in MDR by showing that the extracellular ATP pool in cells is critical in MDR. While the adenosine salvage pathway may help compensate for ATP losses in MDR by providing a mechanism to recoup adenosine, it is not the critical aspect of the role of ATP in MDR as evidenced by the observation that only a subset of MDR cell lines resort to this mechanism via the up-regulation of ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase to maintain drug resistance. In fact, the previous data teach away from modulating extracelluar ATP levels and place the focus on mechanisms which are involved in modulating intracellular ATP levels. Since AMP is the preferred substrate for ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase, with ATP and ADP being poor substrates (Zimmerman, H., 1992, <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>285:345-365), it is unlikely that ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase is involved in modulating extracellular levels of ATP. While high levels of ATP have been demonstrated to be useful in the inhibition of tumor growth, its effects on tumor cells have been shown to prevent cell growth and induce cell death through the inhibition of the S phase of the cell cycle. U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,918. There has been no implication, prior to the present invention, of the importance of modulating extracellular ATP levels in MDR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Additionally, there has been no identification of an inhibitor of a specific apyrase (an ecto-phosphatase). Such inhibitors and methods for identifying such inhibitors would be useful for studying the importance of ecto-phosphatases in MDR, for modulating MDR and in industrial applications (e.g. determining the titer of microbia in soil). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It would be particularly useful to have more effective mechanisms by which to modulate drug resistance in various organisms. In particular, since the use of Pgp inhibitors has not been totally efficient in overcoming the resistance seen in tumor cells which have been repeatedly exposed to chemotherapeutic agents, it would be useful to have other mechanisms by which to combat such resistance in tumor cells to provide more effective chemotherapeutic treatments. There are many applications for the modulation of drug resistance which are contemplated by the present invention, such as the identification of compounds with activity as pesticides and herbicides. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to compositions and methods for producing pesticidal and herbicidal activity in biological systems or cells. The compositions may be classified broadly as pesticides or more narrowly as herbicides, nematocides, insecticides, fungicides, or rodenticides. The mechanism of the pesticidal and herbicidal activity of the present invention is unknown, but is thought to be related to the manipulation of the ATP gradient across biological membranes, both animal and plant, and manipulation of the activity of ABC transporters and ecto-phosphatases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> For purposes of clarity of description, and not by way of limitation, the detailed description of the invention is divided into the following subsections: </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Conference of Herbicide Resistance in Plants </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Modulation of drug resistance in plants, particularly herbicide resistance, can be accomplished in part through the manipulation of the ATP gradient across biological membranes. In accordance with the invention, the manipulation of extracellular ATP levels and hence the ATP gradient across biological membranes in plant cells by the over-expression of a MDR-ABC transporter and an ecto-phosphatase, results in resistance to certain plant hormones, drugs and herbicides. Such resistance is useful in horticulture of recombinant crops for the elimination of other unwanted plants (e.g. weeds) which are not resistant. The invention is based, in part, on the unexpected observation that the over-expression of either an ecto-phosphatase, or an ABC transporter can confer resistance to certain drugs and herbicides in plants. In addition, modulation of activity of ecto-phosphatases and/or ABC transporters is thought to be responsible for conference of the pesticidal and/or herbicidal activity of the compounds of the present invention and provides for methods of promoting pesticidal and herbicidal activity in cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Modulation as used herein can refer to up-regulation or increasing the activity of a molecule within a cell by either providing an outside source of the molecule (e.g. an expression cassette containing a DNA encoding the molecule) either in single copy or multiple copies which when expressed in the cell increases the amount of the molecule in the cell, by increasing the transcription of the endogenous or exogenous molecule to increase the amount of the molecule in the cell, or by modifying the exogenous or endogenous molecule in the cell post-translationally to achieve an increase in activity of the molecule. Modulation as used herein can also refer to down-regulation or decreasing the activity of a molecule in a cell by either decreasing the amount of the molecule in the cell (this may be achieved by over-expression of an anti-sense RNA corresponding to the molecule or by inhibiting factors necessary for the expression of the molecule) or by modifying the exogenous or endogenous molecule in the cell post-translationally to achieve a decrease in activity. Such post translational modifications may include phosphorylation, adenylation, glycosylation, ubiquitinylation, acetylation, methylation, farnesylation, myristilation and sulfation. Modulation can also be used herein to refer to simple inhibition or activation of activity of a cellular process such as activity of an enzyme such as ecto-phosphatase or ABC transporter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> MDR ABC transporters form channels which facilitate the efflux of molecules, including drugs, from cells. This efflux is possibly effectuated through the &ldquo;piggy-back&rdquo; efflux of drug molecules with ATP, a phenomenon known as symport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the over-expression of an ecto-phosphatase confers drug resistance in both wild-type and/or genetically engineered plants. This effect is seen in plant cells over-expressing plant apyrase grown in the presence of (1) cycloheximide, a potent inhibitor of protein expression, (2) nigericin, an antibiotic which effects ion transport, and (3) N<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(2-isopentenyl) adenine, a cytokinin plant hormone which is herbicidal at micromolar and millimolar concentrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the over-expression of an ABC transporter confers drug resistance in wild-type and genetically engineered plants. In a preferred embodiment, the ABC transporter which is over-expressed is the Arabidopsis ABC transporter AtPGP-1. The over-expression of AtPGP-1 can confer resistance in plants to cycloheximide, nigericin and cytokinins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention the effect of over-expression of both an MDR-ABC transporter and an ecto-phosphatase is enhancement of the ATP gradient across biological membranes and thus stimulation of resistance to certain plant hormones and herbicides. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the MDR-ABC transporter which is over-expressed is the Arabidopsis AtPGP-1 and the ecto-phosphatase that is over-expressed is apyrase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The invention particularly contemplates the conference of resistance in plants to herbicides which resemble established drugs implicated in multidrug resistance, as well as plant hormones such as cytokinin, auxins, gibberellins and brassinosteroids. The present invention also provides products for use as pesticides and herbicides that act through modulation of ABC transporters and/or ecto-phosphatases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The present invention also contemplates the conference of resistance in plants to the nonlimiting list of chemicals, such as set forth in Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Also within the scope of the present invention is the stimulation of the activity of an ecto-phosphatase and an ABC transporter by the over-expression of a regulatory molecule which may act by up-regulating the expression levels or by post-translationally modifying the ecto-phosphatase and the ABC transporter. Such activating regulatory molecules (e.g. calmodulin) may be over-expressed alone or together with the over-expression of the ecto-apyrase and the ABC transporter or any other combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Particular embodiments of the invention include polynucleotides that encode MDR-ABC transporter polypeptides, ecto-phosphatase polypeptides, and stimulatory regulatory polypeptides which are capable of stimulating the efflux of drug molecules from the cells, thus conferring drug resistance. The term polynucleotide encompasses nucleic acid molecules that encode a complete protein, as well as nucleic acid molecules that encode peptides, polypeptides, or fragments of a complete protein.

Such polynucleotides may be incorporated into nucleic acid vectors that are sufficient to permit either the propagation or maintenance of the polynucleotide within a host cell, and expression therein. The nature of the regulatory elements will depend upon the host cell, and the desired manner of expressing the polynucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The invention particularly contemplates providing the polynucleotides to plants. Suitable plants include, but are not limited to, species from the genera Fragaria, Lotus, Medicago, Onobrychis, Trifolium, Trigonella, Vigna, Citrus, Linum, Geranium, Manihot, Daucus, Arabidopsis, Brassica, Raphanus, Sinapis, Atropa, Capsicum, Datura, Hyoscyamus, Lycopersicon, Nicotiana, Helianthus, Lactuca, Bromus, Asparagus, Antirrhinum, Hemerocallis, Nemesia, Pelargonium, Panicum, Pennisetum, Ranunculus, Senecio, Salpiglossis, Cucumis, Bromelia, Glycine, Lolium, Zea, Triticum, Sorghum, Ipomoea, Passiflora, Cyclamen, Malus, Prunus, Rosa, Rubus, Populus, Santalum, Allium, Lilium, Narcissus, Ananas, Arachis, Phaseolus, Pisum, Oryza, Hordeum, Gossypium. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The introduction of the transferred DNA (T-DNA) of the plasmid is accomplished by infecting root calli from Ws ecotype <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>with <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>under kanamycin selection. The calli are then developed further into plants. Valvekens, D., 1992, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85:5536-5540. Alternatively, shoot explants may be infected with the <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>bacteria. Under appropriate conditions, a ring of calli forms around the cut surface which is then transferred to growth medium, allowed to form shoots, roots and develop further into plants. Hooykass, P. J.

Another alternative is to produce transformed plants using free DNA delivery. All plants from which protoplasts can be isolated and cultured to give whole regenerated plants can be transformed by the present invention so that whole plants are recovered which contain the introduced polynucleotide.

<heading lvl="1">Conference of Drug Resistance in Microorganisms </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also directed to a method for the conference of drug resistance to microorganisms, including yeast and bacteria in part through the manipulation of the ATP gradient across biological membranes. In yeast and bacteria, the manipulation of extracellular ATP levels and the ATP gradient across biological membranes by the over-expression of a MDR-ABC transporter and/or an ecto-phosphatase may result in resistance to certain drugs. Such resistance is useful for the growth of microorganisms for biotechnological applications, e.g., those used in heterologous protein production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It is particularly advantageous to be able to produce microorganisms which are resistant to a variety of drugs for large scale fermentation procedures where contamination by microorganisms from the environment may threaten a costly procedure. Additionally, the present invention is useful to create resistant microorganism strains in small scale fermentation processes, industrial applications, as well as in selection systems for the production of recombinant microorganisms for research applications. Research applications may include the use of resistant microorganism strains to study alternative pathways, other than antibiotics, antifungal reagents, or other commonly used drugs which could effectively inhibit the growth of microorganisms involved in disease states of humans and animals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In yeast, a system which could confer drug resistance may be preferred to current research techniques which utilize yeast strains deficient for certain amino acid production pathways. These deficient yeast are used to introduce foreign nucleic acids of interest having a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein or proteins capable of resurrecting a deficient amino acid production pathway. Selection occurs when the yeast is grown in media deficient in that particular amino acid. This method of conferring resistance to yeast may be costly, however, since this requires that the yeast be grown in expensive cocktails of the amino acids in which they are deficient. In certain embodiments of the present invention, a cloning system in yeast confers drug resistance to the yeast coupled to the introduction of a nucleic acid molecule of interest. Such resistance may be constitutive or inducible. The yeast may then be selected by the introduction of inexpensive drugs to which the recombinant yeast would be resistant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments of the invention, bacteria may be produced with increased resistance to certain drugs in order to facilitate the production and to provide a system which allows for selection of bacteria based on another mechanism other than antibiotic resistance. Such resistance may be constitutive or inducible and may be particularly useful in large scale fermentation where contamination by other microorganisms is more likely to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Also contemplated by the present invention is the development of microorganisms which grow in soil (soil flora), particularly those designed to interact with herbicide resistant plants. The soil flora may be engineered with the same resistance to toxins as the plants with which they are engineered to react. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the invention is directed to the development of microorganisms which are resistant to multiple toxins (two-stage resistant microorganisms or multiple-stage resistant microorganisms). The toxins could be presented to such two-stage resistant organisms or multiple-stage microorganisms simultaneously or at independent times. The present invention also contemplates the development of two-stage or multiple-stage resistant plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the over-expression of an ecto-phosphatase confers drug resistance in wild-type or genetically engineered microorganisms. This effect was seen in yeast cells over-expressing plant apyrase grown in the presence of cycloheximide, a potent inhibitor of protein expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the over-expression of an ABC transporter confers drug resistance in wild-type and genetically engineered microorganisms. In a preferred embodiment, the ABC transporter which is over-expressed is the <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>ABC transporter AtPGP-1. This ABC transporter was able to confer resistance to yeast cells grown in the presence of cycloheximide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the invention the affect of over-expression of both an MDR-ABC transporter and an ecto-phosphatase is to enhance the ATP gradient across biological membranes and thus stimulate the resistance to certain antimicrobial agents. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the MDR-ABC transporter which is over-expressed is the <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>AtPGP-1 and the ecto-phosphatase that is over-expressed is <highlight><italic>Pisum sativum </italic></highlight>apyrase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The invention particularly contemplates, but is not limited to, the conference of resistance in microorganisms to cycloheximide, antibiotics, antifungal agents, pheromones, heavy metals, flourescent dyes, DNA intercalating agents, products of plant secondary metabolism such as polyphenolics and alkaloids, plant growth substances with antimicrobial properties, and the chemicals listed in Table 1 above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids are operably linked to regulatory sequences sufficient to permit the transcription of the nucleic acid in the microorganism of interest. Such constructs may be incorporated into nucleic acid vectors that are sufficient to permit either the propagation or maintenance of the nucleic acid and expression thereof within the host cell. The nature of the regulatory elements is dependent upon the host cell, and the desired manner of expressing the nucleic acid (e.g. constitutively or inducibly). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The invention particularly contemplates providing the nucleic acids of interest to bacteria and yeast. Suitable bacteria include both archaebacteria, which are found in incommodious environments such as bogs, ocean depths, salt brines, and hot acid springs (e.g. sulfur bacteria, extreme halophiles, methanogens), and eubacteria, which are the commonly encountered forms that inhabit soil, water, and larger living organisms (e.g. gram positive, anaerobic, blue-green algae, gram negative, and spirochetes). In a preferred embodiment, the bacteria are <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></highlight>. Suitable yeast include a large group of disparate organisms. Preferred species include the budding yeast, <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></highlight>, and the fission yeast, <highlight><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods may be used to introduce the polynucleotide sequences into a microorganism. In bacteria for example, techniques such as transformation of plasmid DNA using calcium chloride competent cells, high efficiency competent cells, electroporation, or infection by bacteriophages as described in <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Mass., USA (1998) maybe used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In yeast, methods to introduce polynucleotides can include, but are not limited to, the introduction of polynucleotides by integrative transformation, transformation by electroporation, spheroplast transformation, transformation using lithium acetate as described in <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</italic></highlight>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Mass., USA (1998) and PEG lithium acetate transformation procedure (Eble, R., 1992, <highlight><italic>Biotechniques </italic></highlight>13:18-20). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Also within the scope of the present invention is the conference of drug resistance to eukaryotic cell lines grown in tissue culture, including insect cell lines and mammalian cell lines. The conference of drug resistance to eukaryotic cell lines may be useful in the use of such cell lines for the production of recombinant proteins, the study of chemotherapeutic resistance in cells from various sources, and in the study of toxic levels of drugs in certain resistant cell lines. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Inhibition of Drug Resistance in Microorganisms to Treat Infection </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to methods for inhibiting or ameliorating infection in animals and humans caused by microorganisms, particularly bacterial and fungal infections using inhibitory mechanisms against an ecto-phosphatase and an ABC transporter and modifying the ATP gradient across biological membranes. The invention is useful in the inhibition or amelioration of a wide range of infections including, but not limited to, gram-negative bacterial infection including gram-negative sepsis, gram-negative endotoxin-related hypotension and shock, rabies, cholera, tetanus, lymes disease, tuberculosis, <highlight><italic>Candida albicans</italic></highlight>, Chlamydia, etc. The invention is based, in part, on the unexpected result that when mutant yeast deficient in two potent extracellular ATP phosphatases were cultured in cycloheximide, they were not able to grow. Surprisingly, they were rescued by the over-expression of a plant MDR-ABC transporter AtPGP-1, suggesting that the inability to grow in the drug was caused by an inability to efflux the drug which was coupled to a deficiency in extracellular ATP phosphatase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Drug sensitivity in microorganisms may be achieved by introducing nucleic acid molecules into bacteria and yeast (as described above) that are capable of conferring inhibition of the activity of an endogenous ecto-phosphatase and an ABC transporter. Such nucleic acid molecules may transcribe an antisense RNA complimentary to endogenous RNA for an ecto-phosphatase or an ABC transporter, encode for inhibitory regulatory proteins, or encode for inhibitory drug molecules. The inhibition or amelioration of the infections may involve the administration of an anti-microbial agent (such as an antibiotic or an antifungal agent) with the concurrent administration of the aforementioned nucleic acid molecules (which may be achieved through bacteriophages, etc). Additionally, inhibitors of ecto-phosphatases or ABC transporters may be administered via a physiologically acceptable carrier as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the present invention is useful in the development of genetic and epigenetic systems in humans for resistance to toxins from biological and non-biological sources. Such sources include, but are not restricted to, pathogens produced by microbial infections, pathogens and toxins derived from biological sources through human contrivance, environmental toxins not produced through biological action, and toxic substances created synthetically. In a particular embodiment, humans at risk for exposure would be vaccinated either with a gene therapy designed to bolster endogenous ATP gradients in human cells, or a chemical substance capable of enhancing the strength of the ATP gradient. In both instances, the target of the genetic or chemical therapy would be either the ABC transporter activity, ecto-phosphatase activity or both. In another embodiment of the invention, only the ABC transporter activity or the ecto-phosphatase activity in an infecting organism is diminished to inhibit drug efflux. Recombinant techniques may be used to introduce DNA sequences to the microorganism which encode for a small inhibitory molecule to either an ABC transporter or an ecto-phosphatase or both to cause the inhibition of drug efflux from the microorganism. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Ecto-phosphatase Inhibition </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Since ecto-phosphatases have been shown by the present invention to be important actors in the modulation of the ATP gradient across biological membranes and thus useful in a variety of applications (e.g. the modulation of drug resistance), it is an object of the present invention to provide methods and assays for the identification of inhibitors of ecto-phosphatases (e.g. apyrase). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A high-throughput screen was developed to rapidly identify potential inhibitors for ecto-phosphatases and is described below in Example 6. This high-throughput screen is particularly useful, since no known specific inhibitors of the apyrase enzyme exist. Using the high throughput screen, ecto-phosphatase inhibitors are isolated by screening a small molecule library (e.g. a combinatorial library) for inhibitory activity to ecto-phosphatase (e.g. apyrase) activity. Once ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules are isolated from such a screen, the inhibitors may be further tested for their ability to specifically inhibit the ATPase activity of the ecto-phosphatase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention are chemically stable and physiologically active and include, inter alia, those molecules represented by Formulae I through XIX below.  
<chemistry-cwu id="CHEM-US-00001">

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Preliminary pharmacophore studies revealed that the small molecules represented by Formulae I through XIX fall into five classes of compounds (sulfanamides, guanidines, aminothiazoles, thioketones and benzamides). Most of these chemical classes are found in other physiologically-active compounds, including those having pharmaceutical and therapeutic use. For example, sulfanimides are widely used as antibiotics. Additionally, studies for the isolation of small molecules capable of reversing MDR have described molecules belonging to two of the classes of molecules of the present invention (Medina et al., 1998, <highlight><italic>Bioorg Med. Chem. Lett. </italic></highlight>8:2653-2656 and Dhamant et al., 1992, <highlight><italic>J. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>35:2481-2496). The molecules described by Medina et al. have been shown to affect MDR and the mode of action of the molecules is believed to involve tubulin interactions. The thiazine derivatives described by Dhamant et al. reverse the resistance in tumor cells to vincristine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention are useful in reversing MDR in Arabidopsis plants and yeast. MDR reversal in plants and yeast cells may be shown by growing the cells in the presence of relevant drugs and in the presence and absence of the inhibitor. Cells which cannot grow in drug, in the presence of an ecto-phosphatase inhibitor, have a reversal in MDR. Additionally, the ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention are useful in reversing drug resistance in mammalian cell lines (e.g. normal COS-7 cells and breast cancer tumor cells (e.g. HS5787, MB231 and MB435)) grown in the presence of a drug (e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent). MDR reversal in mammalian cells may be shown by using the flourescent compound calcein-AM. Esterases present in cells cleave the aceto-methoxy ester (AM) from the calcein-AM and liberate calcein. Calcein is a flourescent compound which is excitable by the 488 nm laser of a FACSCaliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.), while the uncleaved calcein-AM is not excitable. Wild type cells incubated in the presence of calcein-AM show a high level of fluorescence while MDR state cells, which efflux the calcein-AM faster than the cellular esterases can cleave it, do not show a high level of fluorescence. The mammalian cells can be tested for the reversal of MDR with the ecto-phosphatase inhibitors of the present invention by the amount of calcein fluorescence detected in the cells. Furthermore, the relative importance of the mammalian MDR gene and the mammalian apyrase gene in MDR can also be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Specificity of the ecto-phosphatase inhibitors of the present invention may be tested with the screening assay described in Example 6 below. Inhibitors are tested for their ability to inhibit acid phosphatases, alkaline phosphatases, myosin phosphatases and the luciferase ATPase. The assays may be performed using techniques known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment, the ecto-phosphatase is an apyrase and the ecto-phosphatase inhibitor is a molecule selected from among molecules represented by the Formulae I through XIX. In another preferred embodiment, the ecto-phosphatase is apyrase and the ecto-phosphatase inhibitor is a molecule selected from among molecules represented by the Formulae I through V. In a preferred embodiment, the ecto-phosphatase is apyrase and the ecto-phosphatase inhibitor is a molecule selected from among molecules represented by Formula I and Formula II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The ecto-phosphatase inhibitors of the present invention which are acidic or basic in nature can form a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic bases or acids, respectively. These salts may be physiologically acceptable for in vivo administration in plants and animals, including humans. Salts of the acidic compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the acidic compound with an appropriate molar quantity of the chosen inorganic or organic base in an aqueous or suitable organic solvent and then evaporating the solvent to obtain the salt. Salts of the basic compounds of this invention can be obtained similarly by treatment with the desired inorganic or organic acid and subsequent solvent evaporation and isolation. The skilled artisan can produce salts of the small molecules of the present invention using techniques known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The skilled artisan readily can determine the amount of the ecto-phosphatase inhibitor that is required to inhibit the ecto-phosphatase by measuring ATPase activity in the presence and absence of varying amounts of the inhibitor. Phosphatase activity can be determined by assessing the dephosphorylation of ATP and liberation of phosphate as described below in Example 6. Additionally, parameters may be measured that are known to be associated with ecto-phosphatase activity to determine whether the molecule has ecto-phosphatase inhibitory activity. For example, ecto-phosphatase inhibitory activity may be measured in cells (e.g. plant, yeast, mammalian, tumor, etc. cell lines) by assessing the loss of resistance to drugs. Furthermore, the ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention may be tested for specific inhibitory activity to ecto-phosphatases versus general phosphatases or for specific inhibitory activity for a particular ecto-phosphatase activity (e.g. apyrase). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as stated above, the ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention are useful in reversing MDR. Such a reversal has several applications including reducing resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in tumor cells and reducing resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Inhibition of ecto-phosphatases is useful in industrial applications as well. For example, one of the most sensitive and cost effective ways of determining the titer of microbia in soil, sludge, blood, food, and textiles is the luciferase assay which allows for the estimation of microbial biomass through the determination of precise concentrations of ATP. The sensitivity of the assay requires that &ldquo;background&rdquo; ATP or nonmicrobial ATP present in the system as a consequence of the source of the sample be separated from the ATP used in the microbe count. The removal of background ATP is accomplished using the ecto-phosphatase, apyrase. After removal of the background ATP with apyrase, the apyrase must be removed or inactivated. General techniques for removal could be improved and simplified with a method of inactivating the apyrase by adding a specific apyrase inhibitor of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides physiologically acceptable compositions comprising an ecto-phosphatase inhibitor of the present invention and a physiologically acceptable carrier or diluent as described above. The use of such physiologically acceptable carriers or diluents are well known in the art. Formulation of such physiological compositions can be made using known procedures, e.g. according to Remington&apos;s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. Formulation of the compounds of the present invention may be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against contamination by microorganisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The physiological forms of the compounds of the invention suitable for administration include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Typical carriers include a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water buffered aqueous solutions (i.e. biocompatible buffers), ethanol, polyols such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, surfactants, and vegetable oils. Isotonic agents such as sugars or sodium chloride may be incorporated into the subject compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the inhibitors of the present invention would be used to inhibit the activity of ABC transporters in pathogenic organisms. Many organisms use ABC transporters in the mechanism of their pathogenesis. For example, certain fungal plant pathogens have been shown to require activity of an ABC transporter during host infection (Urtban et al. 1999. <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>18:512-521). Therefore, inhibitors of the present invention would be used to bind to and/or inhibit an ecto-phosphatase and/or an ABC transporter so that pathogenesis is inhibited. In addition to chemical compounds, the inhibition of the ecto-phosphatase and/or ABC transporter would be accomplished by expression in the target cell of endogenous compounds that also inhibit ecto-phosphatase and/or ABC transporter. Expression of the endogenous compounds would be accomplished by one of skill in the art using methods for gene expression regulation such as antisense technology. Other methods for manipulating gene expression in cells would be used by one of skill based on the endogenous compound to be manipulated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to compositions and methods for producing pesticidal activity. These compositions may be broadly classified as pesticides or more narrowly as herbicides, nematocides, insecticides, fungicides, algaecides, miticides or rodenticides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Seventeen of the ecto-phosphatase inhibitors presented above were tested for their effect on the growth of <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></highlight>. Two of the compounds were found to have herbicidal activity. Compound of Formula X was shown to be herbicidal at concentrations between 25 and 50 &mgr;g/ml while compound of Formula XII was found to have herbicidal activity at concentrations as low as 20 &mgr;g/ml. Moreover, compound of Formula X was shown to have a low level of aquatic toxicity as compared to other well-known herbicides. These studies demonstrate that ecto-phosphatase inhibitors have potential activity as pesticides, in particular as herbicides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Although the specific mechanism of action is not known for these compounds it is thought to be related to ecto-phosphatase inhibition. The fact that the majority of the ecto-phosphatase inhibitors tested did not have herbicidal activity at the concentrations tested may indicate a selectivity of certain compounds against the ecto-phosphatases. It is also possible that the active compounds effect more than just ecto-phosphatase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> One compound of Formula X exhibiting herbicidal activity at the concentrations tested was not nearly as effective in treating transgenic plants which overexpressed an MDR-ABC transporter. These results further implicate extracellular ATP levels in the action of these herbicidal compounds. </paragraph>

Plasma membrane was prepared from 30 g of pea root tissue (Zhu Mei Jun and Chen Jia, 1995, <highlight><italic>Acta Botanica Sinica </italic></highlight>37:942-949). Western analysis was performed on 15-30 &mgr;g of protein from cytoplasm, plasma membrane and nuclei using a polyclonal anti-apyrase antibody raised against the purified pea protein (Tong, C. et al., 1993, <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>101:1005-1011). To determine the orientation of the pea apyrase in the pea plasma membrane, outside-out vesicles were prepared (Short et al., supra.), and the accessibility of the enzyme was determined by selective trypsin proteolysis, or membrane shaving, followed by activity assays and western blotting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Phosphate uptake experiments and growth assays: In all experiments the growth media did not contain sugar, and plants were grown in sterile culture at 22&deg; C. under 150-200 &mgr;E of continuous light. Unless otherwise noted, a standard 0.8% agar medium (Becton Dickenson, Cockeysville, Md.) containing 100 &mgr;M phosphate was used for uptake assays (Somerville, C. et al., 1982, <highlight><italic>Methods in Chloroplast Biology</italic></highlight>, Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam, pp 129-138). Plants used for the phosphate uptake experiments were grown singly in 1 ml of the standard agar medium for 15 days prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, 10 &mgr;Ci<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P was applied to the side of the culture dish and allowed to diffuse through the agar. The lids of 95 mm&times;15 mm tissue culture dishes (Fisher, Pittsburgh, Pa.) were removed to facilitate transpiration. After 18 hours, the plants were removed from the medium. The aerial portions of the plant not in contact with the agar were weighed and counted by liquid scintillation. For each plant the entire root system was carefully pulled from the agar and washed in ice cold water prior to scintillation counting. To measure the transport of the products of ATP hydrolysis by the transgenic plants overexpressing apyrase and by wild-type plants, &lsqb;2,8<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H&rsqb;ATP, &lsqb;&agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP, and &lsqb;&ggr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP (Amersham) were fed to 15-day-old plants in separate treatments. All treatments were analyzed for significance in a T-test (n&gt;4-6 for all groups, *P&lt;0.05, error bars&equals;s.e.m.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Detection of the pea apyrase in nuclei and in purified plasma membrane: By immunoblot assay, the pea apyrase was found to be associated with nuclei and with purified plasma membranes but not with the cytoplasm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). The contents of the lanes in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> are as follows: Lane 1, cytoplasm; Lane 2, purified plasma membrane; Lane 3, purified nuclei; and Lane 4, pre-immune control of nuclei. Protease treatment destroyed both apyrase activity and antigenicity in outside-out plasma membrane vesicles. After trypsin treatment, the exterior face of the vesicle showed 30% of the ecto-phosphatase activity of the untreated sample. Endo-phosphatase activities were retained after trypsin treatment, indicating that the digest occurred exclusively on the exterior face of the membrane. These data indicated that the ecto-apyrase was in fact being expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Transgenic plants preferentially transport the gamma phosphate of ATP: In order to address whether over-expression of ecto-apyrase was stimulating the adenosine salvage pathway, the intracellular uptake of adenosine was measured both in the presence and absence of the over-expression of apyrase. The inability of apyrase to translocate either extracellular AMP or adenosine was demonstrated by the low level of radiolabel accumulated in the transgenic plants fed &lsqb;2,8<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H&rsqb;ATP and &lsqb;&agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>).

In comparison, feeding experiments where the &ggr; phosphate was labeled, the transgenics accumulated three times the amount of labeled phosphate as the wild-type (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>). These data show that the over-expression of apyrase does not induce an increase in the uptake of adenosine and therefore its over-expression does not act to stimulate the adenosine salvage pathway. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Yeast Growth: Yeast were grown at 30&deg; C. under conditions of constant selection for uracil auxotrophy. YNB (Bio101, Vista, Calif.) supplemented with CSM (uracil dropout) and 2% glucose was used to grow strains having pVT101 constructs. Cycloheximide (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) was added to liquid media or spread on solid media to achieve a final concentration of 500 ng/ml. Nigericin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) was added to liquid media or spread on solid media to achieve a final concentration of 25 &mgr;g/ml. Yeast strains used in cycloheximide selection assays were always propagated in the presence of the cycloheximide on plates and then streaked onto new plates containing drug or no drug, such that induced resistance existed in each strain at the time of the start of the assay. For selection assays on plates, single colonies were streaked; for selection in liquid media 0.01 ml of saturated culture was added to fresh media containing the drug. The plates shown in figures were grown for 3-5 days before photographs were taken. Yeast selection assays in liquid media were quantitated by turbidity as measured by absorbance at OD<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Expression of apyrase and AtPGP-1 in plants: The expression of apyrase in plants is as described above in Example 1. Similar methods were employed to express AtPGP-1 in <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>plants with the following modifications. The AtPGP-1 coding region was subcloned into a pBIN vector lacking the GUS gene as described in Sidler, et al., 1998, <highlight><italic>The Plant Cell </italic></highlight>10:1623-1636. This plasmid was then transformed into <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>as described above, which was used to infect root calli to produce transgenic plants expressing AtPGP-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Plant growth: <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>seeds were sown in a solid germination media containing MS salt, 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar, and vitamins (Valvekens, D. et al., 1992, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85:5536-5540. For selection assays, cycloheximide was spread on the media to achieve a final concentration of 250 ng/ml. Plant growth was measured by germination percentage after 6-30 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Effect of over-expression of AtPGP-1 in yeast: When a yeast mutant, YMR4, which is deficient in two major extracellular phosphatases and tends to accumulate ATP extracelluarly, was grown in a potent cellular toxin, cycloheximide, it did not grow whereas a wild-type yeast strain, INVSC1, did grow in the presence of cycloheximide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>). Surprisingly, expression of the plant multidrug resistance (MDR) gene, AtPGP-1, enabled the yeast mutant to grow in the toxin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Figure 5A</cross-reference>). The presence of AtPGP-1 in the wild-type yeast did not have any effect when grown in the presence of cycloheximide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). The same result was obtained when the yeast strains were cultured in nigericin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C, 3D</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Figure 5B, 5C</cross-reference>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</cross-reference>, starting from the top of the dish clockwise, the cells are as follows: INVSC1 (wild-type) overexpressing AtPGP-1, YMR4 containing the vector alone, YMR4 overexpressing AtPGP-1, and INVSC1 containing the vector alone. When grown without drug, all the cells grow (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). However, when grown in drug, only the YMR4 containing vector alone shows reduced growth. The survival of the AtPGP-1 transformed strains was due to the ability of the MDR1 channel to efflux the toxin, hence lowering the actual cellular concentration of the poison cycloheximide. The sensitivity of the untransformed mutant to the drug is likely due to a loss of the ATP gradient below a point at which endogenous transporters, similar to AtPGP-1 can function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Effect of over-expression of AtPGP-1 in plants: The over-expression of AtPGP-1 was able to confer resistance to cycloheximide in plants (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 6</cross-reference>) and to the cytokinin, N<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>-(2-isopentenyl) adenine (2IP) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). These results had not been observed previously and in fact, the prior art actually teaches away from this finding suggesting that over-expression of plant AtPGP-1 is not involved in drug resistance. See Sidler, M. et al., 1998, <highlight><italic>The Plant Cell </italic></highlight>10:1623-1636. Therefore, this result was particularly unexpected in plants. Additionally, since Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtPGP-1 are able to grow in both cycloheximide and cytokinin, this suggests that the conference of drug resistance by AtPGP-1 is likely to be seen with other chemicals as well and is not an isolated phenomenon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Effect of over-expression of apyrase on drug resistance in plants: Another unexpected result was obtained when the plant apyrase gene was over-expressed in plants. Over-expression of apyrase in plants resulted in the conference of resistance to cycloheximide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A and 6</cross-reference>). The same result was obtained when the plants were grown in the presence of a cytokinin, N<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>-(2-isopentenyl) adenine (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). In fact, over-expression of apyrase is surprisingly able to raise the germination rate above the level obtained by the over-expression of the MDR gene AtPGP-1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). Just as under-expression of phosphatase activity in a yeast mutant lacking two potent extracellular phosphatases diminished its resistance to cycloheximide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>), over-expression of a powerful extracellular ATP phosphatase in plants bolstered resistance. The fact that higher resistance was found in plants genetically manipulated only with respect to phosphatase over-expression and not MDR1, indicates that there likely exists other ATP-symporters used in detoxification in addition to MDR1. Minimally, the stronger ATP gradient set up by apyrase in the transgenic plants affects the kinetics of the wild-type MDR1. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> ATP collection: Yeast cells used in the luciferase assays were grown for two days and then transferred to fresh media at the time of the assay. From this time forward, the cells were kept at room temperature on a rotator. Every hour a 1 ml aliquot was taken, the cells in the aliquot were counted on a hemocytometer, a methylene blue viability assay was performed (Boyum, R. and Guidotti, G., 1997, <highlight><italic>Microbiology </italic></highlight>143:1901-1908), the cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored in liquid nitrogen until all the aliquots were collected. For luciferase assays involving plants, <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>plants were grown in sterile culture at 22&deg; C. under 150-200 &mgr;E of continuous light for at least 15 days. Foliar ATP was collected by placing a single 30 &mgr;l drop of luciferase buffer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Cockeysville, Md.) on a leaf and, without making direct physical contact with the plant, the droplet was immediately collected and snap frozen. For each leaf, the area was approximated as an integrated area of a 2-D image of the leaf using NIH1.52 software (Shareware, NIH). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Luminometry: Samples were reconstituted to a 100 &mgr;l final volume in Firelight&trade; buffer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Cockeysville, Md.). After the buffer was added, all samples were kept on ice. ATP standards were reconstituted in 100 &mgr;l of Firelight&trade; buffer and the standards and sample were loaded into a 96-well plate and read on an automated Dynex Technologies Model MLX luminometer (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, Va.). Samples were processed with the addition of 50 &mgr;l of Firelight&trade; enzyme (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Cockeysville, Md.) followed by a reading delay of 1.0 second and an integration time of 10 seconds. Output was taken as an average for the integration time and then averaged for multiple samples. The sample handling time was less than 2 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Pulse Chase experiments: Yeast were grown to saturation in liquid medium, as described above, centrifuged, and resuspended in fresh medium containing 1 &mgr;Ci/ml <highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H-adenosine (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.). The cells were rotated at room temperature for 20 minutes to allow adenosine uptake. After 20 minutes the cells were centrifuged. The pellet was washed twice in ice cold medium, resuspended in culture medium at room temperature, divided equally between five types (five per cell line), and placed on a rotator. Every ten minutes a separate tube from each cell line was centrifuged and the pellet and supernatant were placed in separate scintillation vials. The efflux activity was expressed as the ratio of counts in the supernatant to counts in the pellet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The ATP effluxed by the plant MDR1, AtPGP-1, over-expressed in yeast: In wild-type cells there is a steady-state level of ATP in the extracellular fluid, which is to say that the ATP outside the cells is rapidly degraded by phosphatases and does not accumulate over time (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). However, the expression of the AtPGP-1 doubled this steady-state level (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). If the yeast mutant, YMR4, which is deficient in extracellular phosphatase activity, is analyzed, there was a noticeable accumulation of ATP in the extracellular fluid compared to a control mutant transformed with empty plasmid pVT101 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). In addition to ATP measurements based on luminometry performed on a kinetic time-scale of hours, an earlier differential ATP efflux in MDR1 expressing cells by pulse chase experiments was demonstrated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Furthermore, <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>plants from two independently transformed lines, that constitutively express the AtPGP-1 protein, showed a significant accumulation of ATP on their leaf surfaces (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). Taken together, these data demonstrate the absolute ability of plant MDR1, AtPGP-1, to transport ATP from inside the cell to the outside. Moreover, these data show that ATP efflux channels and phosphatases both have roles in the steady-state level of ATP outside of the cell. This is the first demonstration of the importance of extracellular ATP steady-state levels, and the importance of an ATP gradient across biological membranes in the modulation of drug resistance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Effects of phosphatase inhibitor on plants overexpressing AtPGP-1: <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows that when wild-type and AtPGP-1 overexpressing (MDR OE) <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>plants were either treated with nothing (lane 1), cycloheximide (lane 2), &agr;,&bgr;-methyleneadenosine 5&prime;-diphosphate (phosphatase inhibitor) (lane 3), or cycloheximide and phosphatase inhibitor (lane 4), both the wild-type and the AtPGP-1 overexpressing plants were affected similarly by the presence of phosphatase inhibitor. While the AtPGP-1 overexpressing plants grew significantly better in the presence of cycloheximide alone with a 50% germination rate for the AtPGP-1 overexpressing plants and a 2% germination rate for the wild-type plants, similar germination rates were seen for both the AtPGP-1 overexpressing and wild-type plants in the presence of either phosphatase inhibitor alone (83% and 90% germination respectively) or cycloheximide plus phosphatase inhibitor (no germination at all). The addition of phosphatase inhibitor surprisingly destroys the ability of the AtPGP-expressing plants to grow in the presence of cycloheximide. These data suggest that phosphatases are involved in the conference of drug resistance in plants and that there is a two-component system similar to that demonstrated in yeast in Example 2 and 3 above in which an MDR-like protein and an ATP-gradient-maintaining ecto-phosphatase are important in modulating drug resistance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Growth of cell lines in suspension for salvage pathway experiments: All cell lines were grown in liquid media either containing drug (for the drug selected lines) or not containing drug (for the non-drug selected lines). When the cultures reached a turbidity of 1.00 as measured at a wavelength of 600 in a spectrophotometer (OD<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;1.00), 10 &mgr;l of each culture was then removed and placed in either media with nothing added, 3 mM potassium phosphate; 3 mM adenosine; 9 mM potassium phosphate and 3 mM adenosine (for controls); potassium phosphate and cycloheximide; adenosine and cycloheximide; adenosine, cycloheximide, and potassium phosphate. Cell cultures were further grown for 72 hours, and their turbidity was determined by OD<highlight><subscript>600 </subscript></highlight>readings on a spectrophotometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Growth of cell lines for nigericin experiments: Drug selected lines were removed from cycloheximide containing plates and placed in 5 ml liquid media containing 5 ng/ml cycloheximide. Cell cultures were allowed to grow until they reached an OD<highlight><subscript>600 </subscript></highlight>reading of 1.00, and then 10 &mgr;l from each culture was removed and transferred to culture tubes containing 5 ml of liquid media and 25 &mgr;g/ml nigericin. OD<highlight><subscript>600 </subscript></highlight>readings were recorded daily for a period of up to 72 hours to determine growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> An ATP gradient is critical in MDR: The importance of the ATP gradient in MDR in yeast cells was demonstrated by showing that the growth of cells which were previously grown in drug and had developed resistance to the drug, were not able to grow in high levels of ATP unless they were overexpressing AtPGP-1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Cells which had not been previously selected in drug were able to grow in the presence of high levels of ATP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). These data emphasize that the loss of an ATP gradient is previously resistant cell lines abolishes resistance. This result is new to the understanding of MDR and has led to vast insight into the understanding of the mechanism by which MDR-ABC transporters confer resistance to cells and to methods to modulate such resistance. Moreover, when cells were grown in high levels of ATP and drug (cycloheximide), even the cell lines which had previously showed resistance to drug were unable to grow in the presence of drug and ATP. These data indicate that when the ATP gradient across biological membranes is destroyed (by the presence of high extracellular levels of ATP), efflux of drugs cannot be achieved and therefore, drug resistance is abolished. In summary, the multi-drug resistance channel is not functional without an ATP gradient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The drug resistance is not due to an adenosine salvage pathway: In order to address whether the involvement of a nucleotide salvage pathway was responsible for the results of the present invention, yeast cells were cultured in the presence of extracellular adenosine and extracellular phosphate. The acid phosphatase yeast mutant, YMR4, was selected because its decreased ecto-phosphatase activity makes it an ideal candidate for studying the effect of extracellular nucleotides on growth. If an adenosine salvage pathway were involved, then the presence of extracellular adenosine or possibly phosphate should help cells recoup the intracellular ATP losses due to ATP/drug efflux and should help cells grow in the presence of drug whether or not the cells were overexpressing AtPGP-1. In contrast, however, the addition of adenosine or phosphate to the media did not enhance resistance to the cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). In fact, cells overexpressing AtPGP-1 grew best in drug alone, with the addition of adenosine and/or phosphate being slightly inhibitory. Furthermore, cells which did not express AtPGP-1 were unable to grow in drug regardless of the presence of adenosine and/or phosphate. These data suggest that an adenosine salvage pathway is not the principal mechanism at work in the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREEN FOR ISOLATING APYRASE INHIBITORS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Small Molecule Library: A small molecule library (DIVERSet format F), which was specifically constructed to maximize structural diversity in a relatively small library (9600 compounds), was obtained from ChemBridge Corporation (San Diego, Calif.). The small molecules (supplied in 0.1mg dehydrated aliquots) were dissolved in DMSO, transferred to a 96 well plate, and tested for their ability to inhibit apyrase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The assay: A stringent screen to test the ability of small molecules to disrupt the ATPase activity of the apyrase enzyme was developed based on phosphate-mobylate complexation. The assay was a modification of a phospholipase assay developed by Hergenrother et al. (<highlight><italic>Lipids </italic></highlight>32:783-788 (1997)). Under normal conditions, the apyrase enzyme liberates phosphate from ATP present in the reaction. The liberated phosphate quickly forms a complex upon addition of a small amount of acidified molybdate and ascorbate allowing for the production of a very dark blue color (the less phosphate liberated, the less blue color). Control reactions were performed with heat inactivated apyrase enzyme. Color intensity was detected on an Alpha Imager 2000 with AlphaEase&trade; software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, Calif.). Color changes were also evident by the naked eye. A Biomek 2000 robot (Beckman, Fullerton, Calif.) was used for screening the 9600 samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> To each well of the 96 well plates containing a small molecule from the library, 100 &mgr;l of reaction buffer (60 mM HEPES, 3 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 3 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 3 mM ATP pH 7.0) was added. The apyrase (potato apyrase grade VI, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) enzyme (0.1 units) was added in a 5 &mgr;l volume and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Three buffers were used to visualize activity: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Buffer A: 2% Ammonium molybdate in water </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Buffer B: 11% Ascorbic acid in 37.5% aqueous TCA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Buffer C: 2% trisodium citrate, 2% acetic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Immediately before developing the assay, buffers A and B were mixed in a 1:1.5 ratio. 50 &mgr;l of A:B was added to each well. The 96 well plate was then vibrated on a table surface to mix the solution. The deep blue color developed after approximately 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, 50 &mgr;l of buffer C was added to each well and the blue color became darker, increasing the sensitivity of the assay. The color intensified for up to one hour with no accompanying color change in the control wells containing heat inactivated apyrase enzyme. The color intensity for a single plate was measured on an Alpha Imager 2000 with AlphaEase&trade; software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, Calif.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Nineteen positives were identified from the 9600 compound DIVERSet library. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">IDENTIFICATION OF PESTICIDAL AND HERBICIDAL ACTIVITY IN ECTO-PHOSPHATASE INHIBITORS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Using the compounds identified as ecto-phosphatase inhibitors, the compounds were screened for inhibition of pre-emergent plant growth as well as post-emergent plant growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Pre-emergent plant growth: Arabidopsis wswt were plated on germination media (2 ml per well in 24 well plates) in the presence of three concentrations of each ecto-phosphatase inhibitor compound (10 &mgr;g, 25 &mgr;g, and 50 &mgr;g). Plates were placed in an incubator at 22&deg; C. under constant fluorescent illumination. Growth was assessed after two weeks. Three of the seventeen compounds showed some type of growth inhibition. Compound of Formula IX caused plants to appear slightly more pale than normal at the 50 &mgr;g concentration. Compound of the Formula X caused plants to appear bleached at concentrations of 25 &mgr;g and 50 &mgr;g, with a more complete bleaching of the plant at 50 &mgr;g. Plants plated on compound of the Formula XII germinated but did not continue to grow. The herbicidal effect of this compound was seen at all concentrations tested, although the inhibitor effect appeared slightly less severe on plants plated on 10 &mgr;g (i.e., the plants grew slightly). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Post-emergent growth: The Arabidopsis strains RLD wild-type and MDROE4 were sown in soil as previously described, vernalized, and allowed to grow for 2 weeks at 22&deg; C. under constant fluorescent illumination. Pots of plants then received a single dose of 25 &mgr;g/ml (to cover a 10 ml area) of compound of Formula X in DMSO in a 3 ml aliquot of water. Plants were allowed to grow as normal. The post-emergence application caused a &ldquo;burn-down&rdquo; effect on the plants, as all plants in the pots became necrotic and wilted. Plants appeared dead, but after two or three days shoots began to re-emerge from the pots. The MDROE4 plants appeared to grow up normally, flowering and setting seed. In contrast, the growth of the RLD wild-type plants ceased as the plants began to bolt and were at a height of approximately 2 inches. Only one plant began to flower and that plant did not continue to flower. None of the plants set seed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The same compounds were then tested in a Sea Urchin sperm cell bioassay to determine their level of aquatic toxicity. This test measures the amount of substance required to inhibit successful fertilization. Species used was <highlight><italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic></highlight>. The test conditions were: water temperature 16&deg; C., pH 8.0, salinity 32.1 ppt. Concentrations tested for the compounds were 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 &mgr;g/ml. The compounds were also tested in conjunction with Surflan (0.0075, 0.075, 0.75, and 7.5 &mgr;g/ml) or Surflan alone was tested at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 &mgr;g/ml. Results showed that the compound of Formula X did not have a higher level of aquatic toxicity than some other commonly used herbicides. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Forming graft copolymers in water using labeling of water soluble polymers with photoinitiators. The water soluble polymers can form environmentally responsive hydrophobically stimulated cages, which respond to pH, salt concentration, and/or the addition of water miscible solvents to the aqueous solutions. When the cage is &ldquo;closed,&rdquo; irradiation leads to radicals that cannot escape from the cage and therefore don&apos;t cause substantial polymerization of water soluble monomers in the same solution. When the cage is open via change of pH, salt concentration and/or solvent composition, the photochemically produced free radicals become exposed and cause polymerization. Under certain conditions, only graft copolymers will be formed. These graft copolymers can form a physical hydrogel in which the crosslinks are reversible. Consequently, the gel and sol states are likewise reversible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0002" lvl="0">These hydrogels and graft copolymers may also be formed by a variation of the invention in which the photoinitiator groups are covalently linked to water soluble polymers that do not form cages. In this case, water soluble monomers capable of free radical polymerization in the aqueous solution form grafts to the water soluble polymer allowing formation of physical hydrogels. The physical hydrogels formed in either case show properties responsive to pH, salt and/or solvent composition, so that the hydrogels may be rendered to a powder by addition of methanol or other non-solvents and these powders can reform the gels. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">&sect; 1. BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> &sect; 1.1 Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of polymers and, in particular, to polymerization, such as the photoinitiated polymerization of water soluble reactive monomers by radicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> &sect; 1.2 Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention concerns polymerization and the cage effect. These topics are introduced in &sect;&sect; 1.2.1 and 1.2.2, respectively, below. A second aspect of the present invention concerns hydrogels, which may be produced by the first aspect of the invention. Hydrogels are introduced in &sect; 1.2.3 below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> &sect; 1.2.1 Photoinitiated Polymerization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The field of photointiated polymerizations is a subject of intense scientific and industrial study. Many applications such as photoresists, flexographic printing plates, photopolymerizable inks, coatings, and adhesives have been widely used. Yet many aspects of photopolymerization are incompletely understood and not subject to the utmost possibility of control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Water-based photopolymerizations have a special advantage in protection of the environment. The development of water-soluble photoinitiators is under active development and new methods need to be created to control such photopolymerizations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> &sect; 1.2.2 The &ldquo;Cage Effect&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The concept of the &ldquo;cage effect&rdquo; was introduced in 1934 to explain why the efficiency of I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>photodissociation was less in solution than in the gas (Frank, J.; Rabinowitch, E., <highlight><italic>Trans. Faraday Soc., </italic></highlight>30, 120 (1934). This article is incorporated herein by reference.). Frank and Rabinowitch proposed that the solvent temporarily encapsulates the reactive iodide radical atoms in a solvent cage causing the radicals to remain as colliding neighbors before they either recombine or diffuse apart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The cage effect has been widely used to explain many fundamental reaction phenomena; for example, magnetic isotope effects (Turro, N. J., <highlight><italic>J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., </italic></highlight>80, 609 (1983). Lott, W. B.; Chagovetz, A. M.; Grissom, C. B., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>117, 12194 (1995). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.), chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization effects (Closs, G., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>91, 4552 (1969). This article is incorporated herein by reference.), rate-viscosity correlations (Tanner, D. D.; Meintzer, C. P.; Tsai, E. C.; Oumar-Mahamat, H., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>112, 7369 (1990). This article is incorporated herein by reference.), variations in products and yields as a function of the medium (Koenig, T.; Deinzer, M.; Hoobler, J. A., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>93, 938 (1971). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) and variations in quantum yields as a function of the medium (Abram, I.; Milne, F.; Steel, C., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>86, 745 (1969). This article is incorporated herein by reference.). The cage effect arising from solvent is important in explaining the kinetics including the initiation, propagation, and termination steps, of radical polymerization reactions. (Odian, G., <highlight><italic>Principles of Polymerization: </italic></highlight>3<highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>ed., (Wiley-Interscience: New York, 1991). Bosch, P.; Mateo, J. L.; Serrano, J., <highlight><italic>J. Photochem. Photobiol. A, </italic></highlight>103, 177 (1997). Tefera, N.; Weickert, G.; Westerterp, K. R., <highlight><italic>J. Appl. Polym. Sci., </italic></highlight>63, 1663 (1997). Wolff, E.-H. P.; Bos, A. N. R., <highlight><italic>Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., </italic></highlight>36, 1163 (1997). These works are incorporated herein by reference.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Since supramolecular complexation became an intense field of study, cage effects have been one of the most important issues in this field. For example, cyclodextrin has been used as a cage in the study of photochemical reactions of dibenzyl ketones. (Rao, B. N.; Turro, N. J.; Ramamurthy, V., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>51, 460 (1986). Rao, B. N.; Syamala, M. S.; Turro, N. J.; Ramamurthy, V., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>52, 5517 (1987). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) To make a long-lasting cage, people have tried to modify cage structures to cause more interactions between the host (cage) and the guest (radical pair). Among these are hydrophobic interactions in aqueous solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Recently, many researchers have focused on the study of radical recombination in micelle systems. (Gould, I. R.; Zimmt, M. B.; Turro, N. J.; Baretz, B. H.; Lehr, G. F., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>107, 4607 (1985). Wu, C.-H.; Jenks, W. S.; Koptyug, I. V.; Ghatlia, N. D.; Lipson, M.; Tarasov, V. F.; Turro, N. J., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>115, 9583 (1993). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) Turro et al. have investigated the effects of systematic changes in radical structure (hydrophobicity) and micelle structure. (Turro, N. J.; Wu, C.-H., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>117, 11031 (1995). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> &sect; 1.2.3 Hydrogels </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Gels are chemically or physically cross-linked networks of polymers that can be swollen by liquids. Among the gels, a hydrogel is a network of hydrophilic polymers in which a large amount of water is present. Because of their relatively high biocompatibility, research on hydrogels has been focused on biomedical applications. (Peppas, N. A. e. a., <highlight><italic>Hydrogels in Medicine and Pharmacy; Properties and Applications </italic></highlight>(CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1987) Vol. 3. This work is incorporated herein by reference.) Artificial skin (Chardack, W. N.; Brueske, D. A.; Santomauro, A. p.; Fazekas, G., <highlight><italic>Ann. Surg., </italic></highlight>155, 127 (1962). DeRossi, D., <highlight><italic>Polymer Gels </italic></highlight>(Plenum Press New York, 1991). These works are incorporated herein by reference.) or contact lenses (Wichterle, O.; D., L., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>185, 117, (1960). Wichterle, O.; D., L. U.S. Patent (1961). These works are incorporated herein by reference.) have a long history in the applications of the hydrogels. Recently, drug delivery system using hydrogels became a very fast growing research area. (Peppas, N. A.; Bures, P.; Leobandung, W.; Ichikawa, H., <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Pharma. Biopharm, </italic></highlight>50, 27, (2000). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> &sect; 1.2.3.1 Physical Hydrogels Differ From Covalently Crosslinked Hydrogels </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In physical gels, a gelation occurs through van der Waals or hydrogen bonding or other noncovalent interactions between chains. (&ldquo;Thermoreversible Gelation of Polymers and Biopolymers, by J.-M. Guenet, 1992, Academic Press. Incorporated herein by reference.) Physical gels require high cooperativity to be stable. For example, the energy involved in van der Waals interaction can be small compared to kT. Consequently, these gels can be reversible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Most physical hydrogels are biopolymers, such as gelatin gels (Katz, J. R.; Derksen, J. C.; Bon, W. F., <highlight><italic>Rec. Trav. Chim. Pays</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Bas, </italic></highlight>50, 725, (1931). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) and polyssacharide gels (Anderson, N. S.; Campbell, J. W.; Harding, M. M.; Rees, D. A.; Samuel, J. w. B., <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol., </italic></highlight>45, 85, (1969). This article is incorporated herein by reference.). Gelatin gels (Petzron, I.; Djabourov, M.; Bosio, L.; Leblond, J., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci. polym. Phys. Ed., </italic></highlight>28, 1823, (1990). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) consist of triple helices. Polysaccharide gels are known to be composed of double helices (Hermansson, A. M., <highlight><italic>Carbohydr. Polym., </italic></highlight>10, 163, (1989). This article is incorporated herein by reference.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> There are few examples of physical gels made by synthetic polymers. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) gels are probably the first system of this kind ever to be studied. (Sone, Y.; Hirabayashi, K.; Sakurada, I., <highlight><italic>Kobunshi Kagaku </italic></highlight>10, 1, (1953). Kominami, T.; Naito, R.; Odanaka, H., <highlight><italic>Kobunshi Kogaku, </italic></highlight>12, 218, (1955). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) Very intensive studies of PVA gels have been performed (Peppas, N. A.; Merrill, E. W., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci. Polym Chem. Ed., </italic></highlight>(1976). Finch, C. A. <highlight><italic>PVA-Properties and Applications </italic></highlight>(John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1973). These works are incorporated herein by reference.), including studies of chemically cross-linked PVA gels. (Takamura, T.; Takayarna, G.; Ukida, G., <highlight><italic>J. Appl. Polym. Sci., </italic></highlight>9, 3215, (1965). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) Physical gels are generally &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; than chemical gels. For example, the physical cross-linking of a gel can be destroyed adding large amounts of solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> &sect; 1.2.3.2 Intelligent Hydrogels </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The first responsive polymer gel was created by Katchalsky in 1949 by cross-linking water-soluble polyelectroyltes to form gels that swelled and shrank in response to changes in solution pH. (Katchalsky, A., <highlight><italic>Experientia, </italic></highlight>5, 319 (1949). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) That gel showed a gradual response to changes in pH. Tanaka (Tanaka, T., <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. lett., </italic></highlight>40, 820 (1978). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) observed a sharp phase transition in ionized polyacrylamide gels. Since this work, the field of responsive gels has expanded dramatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The relatively large and sharp chemical or physical changes of hydrogels in response to small chemical or physical changes has led to some hydrogels being called &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; gels. (Hoffman, A. S., <highlight><italic>Macromol. Symp., </italic></highlight>98, 645 (1995). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) Response of the hydrogel to environmental changes, such as temperature (Hirose, H.; Shibayama, M., <highlight><italic>Macomolecules, </italic></highlight>31, 5336 (1998). This article is incorporated herein by reference.), pH (Osada, Y., <highlight><italic>Adv. Polym. Sci., </italic></highlight>82, 1 (1987).

This article is incorporated herein by reference.), light (Suzuki, A.; Tanaka, T., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>346, 345 (1990). This article is incorporated herein by reference.), or even a specific protein, (Miyata, T.; Asami, N.; Uragami, T., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>399, 766 (1999). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) can cause drastic changes in phase, shape, or surface energy. These characteristics of the hydrogel have been utilized for drug release systems. (Peppas, N. A.; Bures, P.; Leobandung, W.; Ichikawa, H., <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Pharma. Biopharm, </italic></highlight>50, 27 (2000). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Hydrogen bonding is known as one of the fundamental forces to control the behavior of responsive gels. PMA and PEG are well known for forming polymer complexes by hydrogen bonding in solution. (Osada, Y., <highlight><italic>Adv. Polym. Sci., </italic></highlight>82, 1 (1987). Abe, K.; Koide, M.; Tsuchida, E. <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>10, 1259 (1977). Bedner, B.; Morawetz, H.; Shafer, J.

In aqueous solutions of PAAm-PAA and in related polymer solutions, they observed temperature dependent solubility of the polymer. At low pH, they observed turbidity in the solution. They concluded that the complexation of PAA and PAAm is due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid and amide groups (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>.) and that this might cause precipitation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">&sect; 2. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention exploits a cage effect in poly(methacrylic acid) PMA, or in other polyelectrolytes with pH, salt and/or solvent dependent hydrophobic properties with guest radicals produced photochemically to control free radical polymerization. In addition, the invention includes polyelectrolytes with hydrophobic properties that are subject to addition of water miscible solvents to the water solution of the invention. Such solvents could be an alcohol. If alcohol is added to such a water solution, it could act in the same way as increase of pH and weaken the hydrophobic effect so as to effectively open the cage and release the radicals to cause polymerization of a waiting monomer in the solution. The present invention may therefore use the hydrophobic property of PMA to produce an effective pH-responsive cage for initiating radicals in aqueous solution thereby providing a free radical polymerization that can be controlled by pH, or by adding salt, or solvent to the aqueous solution. The present invention may therefore use addition of certain solvents to water solutions to alter the hydrophobic properties of PMA without substantial change of pH. Salt may also play this role. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a photoinitiator labeled PMA is synthesized with a small proportion of the initiating group (PI-PMA) (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (e)) to enable a pH-triggered photopolymerization of water soluble monomers. For this strategy, hydrophobic properties of the radical pairs generated from the photoinitiator permit such radical pairs to remain in the cage long enough to recombine before they escape and initiate the polymerization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention permits the production of, via a pH-gated photopolymerization, a graft copolymer of PMA with PAAm by the polymerization of acrylamide initiated by a photoinitiator appended to PMA. This polymer forms a hydrogel containing a large amount of water for the amount of polymer present. The physically cross-linked network may be formed by inter-chain hydrogen bonding in this system. In place of acrylamide, other water soluble monomers may also be used in this invention for formation of hydrogels. For example, with N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N-isopropylacrylamide may be used. Other hydrogen bonding water soluble monomers, such as CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&boxH;CH&mdash;COOCH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>N(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and other water soluble free radical polymerizeable monomers as are well known in the art of polymerization, may also be used. </paragraph>

Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments and methods shown and the inventors regard their invention as the following disclosed methods, apparatus and materials and any other patentable subject matter to the extent that they are patentable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> &sect; 4.1 Functions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention may function to provide a pH-responsive cage in water with guest radical pairs.

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Certain water-soluble monomers form a polymer in the presence of radicals. Photoinitiator radical pairs, for polymerizing water-soluble monomers in an aqueous solution, are guests to a pH responsive host cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Solubility in water can be achieved by linking ionic groups to conventional oil soluble photoinitiators, for instance, benzophenone, benzil and thioxanthone. In a recent study, photopolymerization of acrylamide in water has been investigated in the presence of water-soluble hydroxyalkylphenones (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). The hydroxyethoxy group at the para position of a phenyl ring in a photoinitiation could be used to link such a group to a poly(carboxylic acid) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>)). In the work to follow this was accomplished and with two other initiators (b and c) the esterification took also place through the tert-hydroxy group to carboxylic group of the PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> &sect; 4.2.2 Exemplary Structures and Their Production </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> PMA chains, as a function of pH, form capsules around hydrophobic groups. See, S. Y. Yang, G. Schultz, M. M. Green, H. Morawetz, &ldquo;The Clustering of Poly(methacrylic acid) around Appended Binaphthyl Labels as Reflected by the Disruption of &ggr;-Cyclodextrin Complexation and Racemization Kinetics&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>32, 2577 (1999). This article is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> If the hydrophobic group is a photoinitiator of polymerization and if the PMA capsule is sufficiently stable to keep the photochemically generated radical pairs from the potentially reactive monomers, the radial pairs would recombine or participate in some transfer reaction rather than initiating the polymerization. This effect, a so-called &ldquo;cage effect&rdquo;, has been studied for a long time, from the case of solvent cages (Tanner, D. D.; Meintzer, C. P.; Tsai, E. C.; Oumar-Mahamat, H., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>112, 7369 (1990). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) to the &ldquo;super cage effect&rdquo; on radical polymerizations (Bosch, P.; Mateo, J. L.; Serrano, J., <highlight><italic>J. Photochem. Photobiol. A, </italic></highlight>103, 177 (1997). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) including emulsion polymerizations (Encinas, M. V.; Lissi, E. A., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci. Polym. Chem. Ed., </italic></highlight>2157 (1983). Torii, H.; Fujimoto, K.; Kawaguchi, H., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci. Part A Polym Chem., </italic></highlight>34, 1237 (1996). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.), photochemical degradation of polymers (Male, J. L.; Yoon, M. G.; Glenn, A. G.; R., W. T. J.; Tyler, D. R., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>32, 3898 (1999). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) and cyclodextrin host-guest chemistry. (Rao, B. N.; Turro, N. J.; Ramamurthy, V., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>51, 460 (1986). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) However, the inventors believe that a photopolymerization triggered by a cage that opens and closes as a function of change in pH in water, or as a function of salt concentration, or as a function of the concentration of solvents to the aqueous solution has not appeared in the literature. The inventors designed a system to test the effect of the PMA ability to form hydrophobic stimulated cages on the photopolymerization of some water-soluble monomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> While PMA is preferred for use as the cage for this invention, it is not unique in its ability to form cages about hydrophobic groups. For example poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) also shows this property and as well certain polymers designated as polysoaps. Other polymers with this property are known, and include, for example, CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&boxH;C(C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)&mdash;COOH. Therefore, the present invention is not restricted to PMA. Further, the invention is not restricted to the photoiniatiators shown here since it can easily be recognized in the art that a wide variety of photoinitiators forming radicals on irradiation or causing radicals to form via interaction with other molecules fit into the general description of the photoinitiators described. The photoinitiator is preferably capable of forming a covalent bond to the polyelectrolyte, which can be PMA or other polyelectrolytes, as noted above. In addition, for the purposes of this invention, photoinitiators may be synthesized allowing their attachment to the chain and with groups that alter their hydrophobicity as is well known in the art of photochemistry and organic chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> &sect;4.2.2.1 Synthesizing Photoinitiable PMAs and Control Experiments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The inventors designed poly(methacrylic acid)s (&ldquo;PMAs&rdquo;) that contain photoinitiator groups in the side chain. Photoinitiators are usually divided according to the reaction mechanism into two classes&mdash;so called Type I and Type II photoinitiators. Upon irradiation, the Type I photoinitiators undergo fragmentation to yield initiating radicals. Type II photoinitiators do not fragment upon irradiation; rather they need to react with other molecules to generate the radicals. This post-fragmentation reaction usually occurs via either a hydrogen abstraction by the excited initiator or a photoinduced electron transfer followed by fragmentation. Those skilled in the art of polymerization and cage effects will easily recognize that Type II photoinitiators can also be used in this invention although the invention is demonstrated with Type I effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment, Type I photoinitiators were used with the PMA cluster as a radical cage. Most Type I photoinitiators contain a carbonyl group substituted with an aromatic group and a tertiary alkyl group. The alkyl group is often substituted with an electron withdrawing group assisting the photofragmentation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the fragmentation mechanism of the photoinitiator in one embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Depending on the nature of the substituent group, the fragmentation can occur at a bond adjacent to the carbonyl group (&agr;-cleavage), or at a &bgr;-position to the aromatic carbonyl (&bgr;-cleavage). The most usual fragmentation of the photoinitiator is &agr;-cleavage and the benzoyl radicals that are formed by &agr;-cleavage are known to be sufficiently reactive to induce polymerization in vinyl monomers. When the fragmentation in the photoinitiator takes place at the &agr;-position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is called a Norrish type I reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the structures of the photoinitiators and the synthetic method used in this embodiment. The photoinitiators (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>)) have reactive hydroxyl groups, which can react with methacryloyl chloride to form the photoinitiable monomers. 2-Hydroxy-4&prime;-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methyl propiophenone (&ldquo;HHMP&rdquo;) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) has two reactive hydroxyl groups: a primary hydroxyl group and an &agr;-hydroxyl group. 1-Hydroxy cyclohexyl phenyl ketone (&ldquo;HCPK&rdquo;) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and benzoin (&ldquo;BZ&rdquo;) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) have only an &agr;-hydroxyl group adjacent to the benzoyl group in which the bond cleavage occurs. The esterification of the primary hydroxy group in HHMP does not change the reactivity of the fragmentation of the photoinitiator. However, it is expected that the reactivity of the bond cleavage in HCPK and BZ will decrease when appended to the polymer. After the reaction of HHMP with methacryloyl chloride, the product (monomer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>)) could be easily isolated from a mixture with the minor product of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) by column chromatography. Photoinitiable polymers were obtained by copolymerization of the photoinitiable monomers of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>) with methacrylic acid monomer initiated by AIBN in 1,4-dioxane at 65&deg; C. At this temperature, the photoinitiator was stable and the labeling percentage could be easily varied. The polymer was dissolved in methanol and purified by precipitation in acetone or diethyl ether. The other two photoinitiators, HCPK and BZ, were also attached to PMA using the same method as for the HHMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The labeling percentages of the photoinitiators were determined by UV spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficients of the free photoinitiators in methanol. Table 1 contains the extinction coefficients and the maximum wavelengths for the UV absorption spectra of each photoinitiator.

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to study the behavior of the photoinitiator in water, both alone and in the presence of PMA, before further study of the photoinitiator bound to the polymer. However, to be used in such a study, the photoinitiator should be soluble in water. Among the photoinitiators attached to the PMA in accordance with the present invention, HHMP (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.) has good solubility in water because of the para-(hydroxyethoxy) group on the benzene ring. Other photoinitiators may be too hydrophobic to be soluble in water. Therefore, the HHMP initiator is one photoinitiator that the inventors studied in the unbound state. As will be discussed below, the fluorescence of the unbound HHMP, and its complexation with cyclodextrin has also been studied by the inventors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The inventors also studied the initiation of the acrylamide polymerization by HHMP in the presence of PMA (unbound to the polymer). Chain characteristics for PMA with respect to hydrophobic moieties similar to those reported in the literature were expected. The aromatic residue of the photoinitiator, therefore, should be adsorbed to the PMA at low pH, as reported for other aromatics (Barone, G.; Crescenzi, V.; Liquori, A. M.; Quadrifoglio, F., <highlight><italic>J. Phys. Chem., </italic></highlight>71, 2341 (1967). Barone, G.; Crescenzi, V.; Pispisa, B.; Quadrifoglio, F., <highlight><italic>J. Macomol. Chem., </italic></highlight>1, 761 (1966). Moncellet-Sauvage, J.; Moncellet, M.; Loucheuz, C., <highlight><italic>Makromol. Chem., </italic></highlight>183, 839 (1982). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) whose solubility in water is enhanced in the presence of PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> 4.2.2.2.1 Control Experiment: Fluorescence of the Unbound HHMP </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The HHMP photoinitiator (6.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>M) was dissolved in aqueous 0.01M PMA. The fluorescence spectrum of the solution was measured at varying pH. The results showed the effect of the cluster formation of PMA around the aromatic photoinitiator on the emission intensity even when the initiator is not covalently attached to the PMA. The fluorescence spectra were obtained from the aqueous solution of the HHMP photoinitiator without PMA and compared with the spectra obtained from the photoinitiator in the presence of PMA. The emission intensity of the photoinitiator that was adsorbed on the PMA, at low pH, was increased on lowering the pH, whereas the emission intensity of the photoinitiator without PMA was decreased with lowering of the pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A transition behavior, that is, a steep change in property at near to pH 5.5, in the fluorescence intensity of the unbound HHMP was observed in the PMA solution as a function of pH. This transition was also observed in the cyclodextrin complexation with the photoinitiator labeled PMA, which will be discussed below and both effects arise from the opening and closing of the cage around this pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> &sect;4.2.2.2.2 Control Experiment: Cyclodextrin Complexation With the HHMP Unbound to PMA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The circular dichroism of the photoinitiator in the presence of the cyclodextrin was measured with and without the PMA solution. &agr;-, &bgr;- or &ggr;-Cyclodextrins were used. HHMP forms a complex only with &bgr;-cyclodextrin, which is demonstrated by an induced circular dichroism (ICD) from 320 nm to 210 nm. Complexation with &agr;- or &ggr;-cyclodextrin could not be detected. The ICD of the complex did not change with varying pH. However, the ICD produced by the complexation of the aromatic photoinitiator HHMP with &bgr;-cyclodextrin was also observed at all pH&apos;s even in the presence of PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in spite of the pH dependence of the fluorescence intensity of the aromatic photoinitiator in the presence of the PMA, the cyclodextrin complexation results indicate that the HHMP adsorbed in the PMA at low pH, as evidenced by the fluorescence data, still can interact with cyclodextrin. This observation demonstrates that the invention will work when the photoinitiator is covalently bound to the polyelectrolyte capable of the cage effect, as for example PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In the absence of the cyclodextrin, the aromatic photoinitiator HHMP can be adsorbed in the PMA cluster at low pH as evidenced by the enhanced fluorescence. However, when the cyclodextrin is present in the solution, the HHMP molecules may diffuse out of the PMA cluster and complex with the cyclodextrin. This may indicate that the HHMP is more stable in a complex with the cyclodextrin than in the PMA cluster. If the aromatic chromophore that was absorbed in the PMA has very poor solubility in water, the barrier of the route to the cyclodextrin through the water phase may be too high at any pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> &sect; 4.2.2.2.3 Control Experiment: Photoinitiation by Unbound HHMP in the Presence of PMA on th Polymerization of Acrylamide </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the inventors chose acrylamide (AAm) as a water-soluble monomer because polyacrylamide is soluble in water, independent of pH. Furthermore, polyacrylamide (PAAm) can be isolated from a mixture with PMA by precipitation into methanol, which is a good solvent for PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As a control experiment, the photoinitiation of acrylamide by free HHMP at different pH&apos;s was studied and no detectable change in polymer yield was found. The effect of the PMA on the photoinitiation of the acrylamide was then studied. The same experiment in the presence of PMA led to similar results, although a small difference was observed between the polymerization tubes at low and high pH&apos;s. Below pH 4, turbidity was observed after 10 minutes of irradiation. This might have arisen by a phase separation, which is known to be caused by the complexation between PMA and PAAm. (Silberberg, A.; Eliassaf, J.; Katchalsky, A., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci., </italic></highlight>23, 259 (1957). Katono, B.; Maruyama, A.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>J. Contolled Release, </italic></highlight>16, 215 (1991). Wang, Y.; Morawetz, H., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>22, 164 (1989). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) However, the yield of the PAAm was not affected significantly by this precipitation, showing that the free photoinitiators are equally reactive at different pH&apos;s, regardless of the conformational change of PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> &sect; 4.2.2.3 Photoinitiator Covalently Appended to PMA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The results of the study of the free photoinitiator were described above and demonstrate that the invention works when a covalent bond between the photoinitiator moiety and the polyelectrolyte exists. As described below, this also leads to the formation of graft copolymers with hydrogel and other potentially useful properties. In the embodiments discussed below, three aromatic photoinitiators were chosen as pendent molecules for the PMA. All photoinitiators in this embodiment have hydrophobic character and have a Norrish type I cleavage mechanism for the fragmentation. They were attached to the PMA by the copolymerization of each monomer with methacrylic acid as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> &sect; 4.2.2.3.1 The Effect of the pH-dependent PMA Conformation on the PMA Appended Photoinitiator Initiated Polymerization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Most of the radical pairing kinetic studies of fragmented radicals upon irradiation have been carried out by laser flash photolysis with monitoring by electron spin resonance (ESR). (Wu, C.-H.; Jenks, W. S.; Koptyug, I. V.; Ghatlia, N. D.; Lipson, M.; Tarasov, V. F.; Turro, N. J., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>115, 9583 (1993). Eichler, J.; Herz, C. P.; Naito, I.; Schnabel, W., <highlight><italic>J. Photochem., </italic></highlight>12, 225 (1980). Vacek, K.; Geimer, J.; Beckert, D.; Mehnert, R., <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., </italic></highlight>2, 2469 (1999). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) Irradiation events were followed using the UV absorption spectroscopy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When the chromophores are fragmented, basically, their absorption spectra will change. If the radical pair recombines forming the original molecule, the UV absorption spectra will be maintained. This recombination reaction will reduce the radicals available to initiate polymerization or to decompose in other ways. Thus, in the absence of monomer molecules, the more frequently the recombination occurs, the slower the overall conversion to decomposition products will be. Therefore, the inventors studied the kinetics of the decay in the UV absorption maximum at different pH&apos;s to gather information on the clustering effect of PMA. To measure the decay rate of the UV absorption of the photoinitiator, the UV spectrum of the solution was measured before and after each irradiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Decay of the absorption band of HHMP (&lgr;<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&tilde;278 nm) in the HHMP labeled PMA (HHMP-PMA) was too fast to be followed at all pH&apos;s upon irradiation by a medium pressure mercury lamp with a maximum wavelength at 365 nm. In the case of the benzoin labeled PMA (BZ-PMA), the decay rate at first was fast (30 minutes), slowing down after further irradiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The UV decay rate of HCPK-PMA was slow compared to the other systems and therefore the kinetics of the UV decay could be followed more precisely. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the intensity of the UV absorption of the HCPK-PMA at all pH&apos;s studied decreased without any spectral shift or change of shape in the range of the original UV absorption wavelength, showing that the original structure of the initiator mainly contributes to the spectra. A recombination process, if it occurs, will reduce the decay rate of UV absorption in this wavelength range while decomposition must produce molecules without or with UV absorption in this wavelength range. The results of these kinetic measurements are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), where the logarithm of the ratio of the UV absorbance after and before irradiation was plotted versus time as a function of pH. The absorption decay showed pseudo-first-order kinetics and the rate constants (k<highlight><subscript>obs</subscript></highlight>) were obtained from the slopes of the first order plots shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the dependence of the decay rate on the pH is shown. Compared to the decay rate at high pH, the rates become slow at low pH where the PMA is known to form a cluster around the label. At pH&apos;s below 6, the UV absorbance of the pendent photoinitiator decreases to about 50% compared to the value at high pH. This clearly shows a transition corresponding to the transition from the cluster to the extended chain conformation of the PMA. This was also observed in the pH dependent complexation of HCPK-PMA with cyclodextrin as discussed below. When the polymer solution (HCPK-PMA) was irradiated in the presence of &ggr;-cyclodextrin at high pH, where the photoinitiating pendent is complexed with cyclodextrin, a slower cleavage rate was observed in the absence of the cyclodextrin (data are marked as CyD in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)) demonstrating the cage effect of the cyclodextrin. (Rao, B. N.; Syamala, M. S.; Turro, N. J.; Ramamurthy, V., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>52, 5517 (1987). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) No cage effect of the cyclodextrin was observed in the case of HHMP-PMA upon irradiation at high pH. Although &bgr;-cyclodextrin formed a complex with the pendent initiator HHMP at high pH, revealed by the induced circular dichroism (to be discussed in the following section), cyclodextrin was not effective in protecting the photoinitiator from bond cleavage leading to decomposition. Consequently, the inventors believe that because the HHMP pendent group has a long spacer (ethoxyhydroxy group) between it and the polymer backbone, the cyclodextrin may be able to move along the spacer. (Harada, A.; Kamachi, M., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>23, 2821 (1990). This article is incorporated herein by reference.), and therefore the cyclodextrin complex may not provide a tight enough fit for the cage effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> &sect; 4.2.2.3.2 pH Dependent Complexation of Cyclodextrin With a PMA-covalently Appended Initiator </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The cyclodextrin complexations with aromatic photoinitiators appended to PMA were measured at various pH. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the circular dichroism, which was induced by complexation with &bgr;-cyclodextrin, of the HHMP appended to the PMA as a function of pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> No signal was observed at a pH below 6. However, when the pH of the solution is higher than about 6, the ICD signal increased sharply. This signal can be reversibly turned on and off by change of the pH around the critical transition pH. This differs from the interaction of the unbound HHMP with cyclodextrin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Based on the results of the fluorescence of the HHMP in the presence of PMA, the inventors believe that the HHMP was adsorbed in the PMA at low pH and protected from contact of water. However, the HHMP adsorbed in the PMA at low pH could still interact with the cyclodextrin, which was revealed by the ICD signal at low pH. In the covalently bound system of the HHMP, the results of the cyclodextrin experiment suggest that the HHMP labels have a much stronger interaction with the PMA cluster than when it is not covalently attached to the PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Similar to the HHMP-PMA, the benzoin-labeled PMA (BZ-PMA) forms a complex only with &bgr;-cyclodextrin. An induced circular dichroism spectrum of the complex between the BZ labels and &bgr;-cyclodextrin shows a peak with maximum around 250 nm. Because of the high extinction coefficient compared to the other photoinitiators at UV absorption peak in the range of 350-220 nm, the complex of the BZ label and cyclodextrin exhibits the highest ICD value. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the induced circular dichroism of the BZ-PMA plotted versus pH. It shows a very sharp transition within several tenths of a pH unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) exhibit the ICD of the HCPK-PMA with cyclodextrins as a function of pH. The HCPK labels can complex with either &bgr;- or &ggr;-cyclodextrin, which differs from the properties of the other initiators (HHMP and BZ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The &ggr;-cyclodextrin complex with the HCPK label gave a larger signal than the &bgr;-cyclodextrin. In both cases, a typical sharp transition of the ICD was observed at pH near 6. This transition pH is similar to the transition observed in the UV irradiation experiment, which was discussed in the previous section. As before, the reversible complexation with the cyclodextrin predicts the pH dependent cage effect in the absence of the cyclodextrin and on exposure to light to form the radicals. This cage effect could also be affected by changing salt concentration, and/or by adding or removing water miscible solvents, such as alcohols for example. The basis for this can be found in the article: S. Y. Yang, G. Schultz, M. M. Green, H. Morawetz, &ldquo;The Clustering of Poly(methacrylic acid) around Appended Binaphthyl Labels as Reflected by the Disruption of &ggr;-Cyclodextrin Complexation and Racemization Kinetics&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>32, 2577 (1999).

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The PMA clustering effect on the unbound and bound photoinitiators by means of the spectroscopic measurements was described in &sect; 4.2 above. The photoinitiation of a water-soluble monomer, acrylamide, with the photoinitiator appended to PMA (PI-PMA) is now described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, to avoid a viscosity effect of the initiator labeled polymer solution on the polymerization of acrylamide, the concentration of the PI-PMA was controlled to 0.01 M and 0.1 M monomer was added to the solution. In the following exemplary embodiments, photoinitiator-appended PMA&apos;s were synthesized with three different photoinitiators. The HHMP-appended PMA is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> &sect; 4.3.1.1 Photopolymerization of Acrylamide by HHMP-PMA as a Function of pH </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In the following exemplary embodiments, the photopolymerization of acrylamide by the HHMP appended to PMA was tested at four different pH&apos;s. The pH&apos;s of solutions were adjusted to 4.2, 5.43, 6.38 and 9.4, respectively. Upon irradiation, the reaction mixture at pH 4.2 turned slightly turbid and a trace amount of white precipitate was obtained. The viscosity of the solution at pH 5.43 was hardly changed upon irradiation and the solution remained clear. At pH&apos;s of 6.38 and 9.4, gelation occurred after several minutes of irradiation. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In each case, these gels were taken out from the tube and washed with large amounts of distilled water. Precipitation into methanol gave a completely contracted powder of the gel. This powder form of the polymer reforms a hydrogel by adding water. Interestingly, the strength of the gel depends on the method of precipitation of the polymer in methanol. More specifically, the absence of stirring leads to a slow contraction of the polymer and allows the gelled polymer to have one piece of white precipitate. When stirring was applied to the precipitation process, the polymer was torn apart to little pieces of white powder. In both cases, the polymer forms a gel by adding water. However, the gel that was obtained from the precipitates in the absence of stirring exhibited stronger gel properties as judged by approximate rheological testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> When fragmentation of the photoinitiator takes place, there can be two radicals in the system. One is a benzoyl radical which is attached to the polymer backbone. The other is a ketyl radical which can be freely released from the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> If the benzoyl radical initiates the polymerization of the acrylamide monomer, it generates a graft copolymer. On the other hand, if the released ketyl radicals initiate polymerization, this may lead to linear polyacrylamide. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates these two probable polymer formation routes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> It was widely believed that the ketyl radicals (2-hydroxy-2-propyl radical) are less reactive than benzoyl radicals and do not contribute to the initiation of the polymerization. (See, e.g., Dietliker, K., <highlight><italic>Photoinitiators for Free Radical and Cationic Polymerization </italic></highlight>(SITA Technology: London, 1991) Vol. 3. This work is incorporated herein by reference.) However, a paper recently published claims that the ketyl radical is more reactive than benzyl radical. (Vacek, K. G.; Beckert D.; Mehanert R., <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., </italic></highlight>2, 2469 (1999). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) However, the inventors found that when acrylamide was polymerized with the photoinitiator-labeled PMA at pH 9.4, a linear polyacrylamide was not obtained. The residue from the rinsing water was examined after filtering the gel. There was no evidence for the presence of the linear polymer. At high pH, the ketyl radicals could change to the corresponding anion. These anions may not be effective for initiation as much as the uncharged radicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In practicing this embodiment of the invention, even if some ketyl radicals freely escaped from the PMA cluster and could initiate polymerization of acrylamide, this would produce only a linear polyacrylamide, which is soluble in water. Since linear polymers of PAAm and PMA are water soluble, the gels that were obtained at high pH&apos;s, which were washed with a large excess of water, could not be homopolymers. Therefore, they were certainly graft-copolymers of PMA and PAAm (PMA-g-PAAm) as drawn in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Linear polymers of PMA and PAAm were mixed in water, as a control experiment. Both polymers were miscible and the solution mixture was clear until the pH of the solution was lowered below 4. At very low pH, turbidity in the mixture was observed. Presumably, this precipitation was caused by the complexation of PMA and PAAm via hydrogen bonding between acid and amide groups, to be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The initiating reactivity of the benzoyl radical toward the acrylamide monomer can be measured by the degree of the polymerization of the grafted polymer, which may be an indicator of the cage effect of the PMA cluster. The degree of the polymerization (DP) of polyacrylamide in the graft copolymer was determined by nitrogen analysis of the isolated polymer (elemental analysis). Information about the degree of the polymerization (DP) and the initiator labeling percentage of the photoinitiator-labeled PMA was predetermined. Using this information, the DP of the PAAm part in the sample can be determined based on the ratio of carbon and nitrogen percentages by equation 11 and 12 with the parameters (x, y, n<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, Z). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the structure of the PMA-g-PAAm along with the structure of the initiator-containing HHMP-PMA. The number of carbons in equation 1 is based on the numbers from the HHMP-PMA and PAAm and the numbers of nitrogen comes only from PAAm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The number of the repeating units (n, DP) of the whole chain of the HHMP-PMA was calculated to be 9880, which is based on the molecular weight that was measured by GPC, when calculated according to the composition of HHMP-PMA, the number of the methacrylic acid and photoinitiator labeled methacrylate grafts is 9700 and 150 respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The number of carbons in the PMA-g-PAAm is 4 from the MA unit, 13 from the HHMP-MA units and 3 for the AAm unit. In case of the nitrogen, the number is one; it only comes from the AAm unit. Therefore, the total number of repeating units of the AAm can be determined based on the carbon and the nitrogen ratio by the following equations (12). The average DP of grafting (average number of Z in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) was calculated by dividing the total number of PAAm units in a macromolecule by the total number of the HHMP-MA units in a macromolecule (n<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&minus;150), assuming that all photoinitiators lead to the same grafting (table 4).</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The gel polymer samples for the elemental analysis were purified by washing them with a large excess of water and precipitation into methanol. Methanol should remove any unreacted PMA or acrylamide monomer from the sample. Samples for the low pH solutions were isolated by adding concentrated HCl into the solution (since PMA is known to be precipitated by concentrated HCl). The precipitates, therefore, should contain mainly PMA with or without the grafted PAAm chains. The results of the elemental analyses of theses samples are listed in Table 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In general, the degree of the polymerization of acrylamide increased with an increase of pH of the reaction mixture. The data in the last row in Table 4 were obtained from stepwise irradiation of the sample at different pH&apos;s. It was initially irradiated at pH 5.4 for 15 minutes. Then the pH of the solution was raised to pH 9.4 followed by irradiation for an additional 15 minutes. The 2nd irradiation yielded a very viscous solution and fibrous white powders could be isolated on addition of methanol to the mixture. This isolated white powder forms a gel.

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> As shown in the Table 4, this precipitate contains a large portion of AAm chains (DP&equals;33200), which is close to the value obtained in a one step irradiation at pH 9.4 and still more than three times larger than the value from one step irradiation at pH 5.4. This indicates that some portions of the initiators at pH 5.4 can recombine inside of the PMA cluster upon irradiation and still can produce active radicals later when the pH is increased to open the PMA clusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> However, when the same experiment as described above was performed with the sample at pH 4.2, no further reaction occurred. The viscosity of the solution was not changed and no more polymers were isolated. This indicates that the cage effect causes recombination of the photochemically produced radicals at pH 5.4, but not at the lower pH. At the lower pH, the cage, although restricting the radicals from causing polymerization in the water solution, nevertheless allows radical reactions that destroy the initial photoinitiator structure. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The transparent gel obtained by UV irradiation of the HHMP-PMA and acrylamide mixture at high pH showed interesting properties. The gel obtained at pH 6.38 was weaker than that synthesized at pH 9.4. These gels turned to a powder when placed in a large excess of methanol. This white powder reformed a gel in water and contracted in methanol reversibly. Precipitates without stirring performs stronger gel formation than the powder prepared by stirring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the swelling behavior of the gel that was obtained at pH 9.4 as a function of pH. The swelling ratio was measured by the ratio of the weight of the swollen gel, which was immersed in the aqueous buffer solution with a constant concentration of the salt (&lsqb;K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;&equals;0.1 M) for 24 hours, to the weight of the dried gel. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the gel swells even at low pH and the swelling ratio was increased smoothly by the increase of the pH of the soaking solution. At high pH, the swelling factor was increased to more than two orders of magnitude of the weight of the dried sample. This polymer may be a &ldquo;superabsorbant&rdquo; hydrogel. (DeRossi, D., <highlight><italic>Polymer Gels </italic></highlight>(Plenum Press: New York, 1991). This work is incorporated herein by reference.) Briefly stated, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the pH reversible swelling behavior of the gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Two pieces of the polymer powder with the same weight were prepared and each of them was immersed in the buffer solutions at pH 4.2 and 9.6, respectively, for 24 hours. The excess of the solutions was decanted and the buffer solutions were switched. That is, the swollen gel at pH 4.2 was put into the pH 9.6 buffer solution and the swollen gel at pH 9.6 was placed into the pH 4.2 buffer solution. After 24 hours of immersion, the extra solution was discarded and the gel weighed. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the contraction of the gel that was swollen at high pH first and contracted at low pH, reached the equilibrium value within 24 hours. However, the gel swollen at low pH first swelled slowly at high pH. It took 4 days to reach the usual swelling ratio observed at the high pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The swelling factor of the gel obtained by the photopolymerization at pH 6.38 (Table 5), had a smaller swelling ratio than that of the gel obtained at pH 9.4.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The inventors believe that hydrogen bonding between acid and amide may be the driving force of the hydrogel formation. Hydrogen bonding is known to make an interpenetrating gel network (IPN) of PAA and PAAm (Katono, H.; Maruyama, A.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>J. Controlled Release, </italic></highlight>16, 215 (1991). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) or PDMAAm. (Aoki, T.; Masahiko, K.; Katono, H.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>Macromoleecules, </italic></highlight>27, 947 (1994). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) PAAm and PAA are known to complex with polymers which are hydrogen bonds acceptors. (Silberberg, A.; Eliassaf, J.; Katchalsky, A., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci., </italic></highlight>23, 259 (1957). Wang, Y.; Morawetz, H., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>22, 164 (1989). Katono, H.; Maruyama, A.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>J. Controlled Release, </italic></highlight>16, 215 (1991). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) At low temperature, the two polymers form complexes by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, resulting in dehydration and precipitation. At higher temperature, the hydrogen bonds of the complex dissociate leading to the solubilization of the polymers. (Katono, H.; Maruyama, A.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>J. Controlled Release, </italic></highlight>16, 215 (1991). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Since the polymerization was carried out in the absence of crosslinking agent such as N,N,-bisacrylamide, another possibility of gel formation is by crosslinking via recombination of two growing grafted chains. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>.) However, this possibility is inconsistent with the observation that the polymer gel dissolved in 7.0 M urea aqueous solution (room temperature with stirring). Urea has been used to break the hydrogen bonds between acid-amide chains that exist in PAA and PAAm or PDMAAm by many researchers including Aoki et al. (Aoki, T.; Masahiko, K.; Katono, H.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>Macromoleecules, </italic></highlight>27, 947 (1994). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) After removing of urea by dialysis, the graft copolymer was isolated by adding methanol and it reformed the gel. Urea is a well known denaturant for breaking of hydrogen bonds in proteins or DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> It was expected, therefore, that the hydrogen bonding between acids and amides might play an important role in the PMA-g-PAAm hydrogel system. Hydrogen bonds would connect the whole system forming a physical gel in an aqueous system without precipitation. However, since the gel existed at all pH&apos;s, there should still be some of hydrogen bonding interaction between chains even at high pH where most &mdash;CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H groups are converted to &mdash;CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> (FIG. (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> <highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> PMA-g-PAAm is a copolymer with a high density of grafts (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>.), which may cause difficulty in hydrogen bonding between carboxylic groups and amides. The number of the acrylamide (AAm) repeating units in the graft (300) is about 5 times larger than the number of the methacrylic acid (MA) repeating units between grafting points (65), which was estimated by dividing the total number of the HHMP-PMA unit (9880) by the total number of HHMP-MA unit (150). It may be difficult for a grafted PAAm chain to penetrate into the other PAAm grafted chains on the other PMA chain to reach the carboxylic groups of the PMA. Therefore, amide-amide interactions, as well as amide-acid interactions, may contribute significantly to the network formation. Hydrogen bonds between amide groups in PAAm could be the reason why the complexes between PDMAAm and PAA dissociate at higher temperature (70&deg; C.) than PAAm-PAA complexes (25&deg; C.). Alkylated amide groups in PDMAAm only can act as hydrogen acceptors, therefore, there is no intramolecular hydrogen bonds in PAAm. On the other hand, amide groups in PAAm can be hydrogen-bond donors or acceptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Although gels have been intensively studied for decades, there are only relatively few examples of physical gels in water, that is, that are not covalently crosslinked. As mentioned in &sect; 1.2.3.1 above, most are biopolymers. Further, physical cross-linking requires high concentration of the polymer. In the examples described, gelation occurred in very dilute solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Graft copolymer gels are a relatively new subject in hydrogel research. A graft copolymer of PMA and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been developed for a gel, which responds to the pH change of the system with a change of volume. (Hassan, C. M.; Doyle III, F. J.; Peppas, N. A., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>30, 6166 (1997). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) However, this copolymer is actually not a purely grafted copolymer but a chemically crosslinked network using the cross-linker, N,N&prime;-bisacrylamide. Hoffman et al. (Chen, G.; Hoffman, A. S., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>373, 49 (1995). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) reported a graft copolymer consists of PNIPAAm and PAA, which exhibit temperature-induced phase transition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The inventors can demonstrate that the gel described here is not chemically cross-linked since it dissolves in urea solution. After the urea was removed by dialysis and methanol, this polymer still formed a gel. In the following section, the hydrogen bonding interaction in the gel using a graft copolymer of the stronger hydrogen bond acceptor N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMAAm) is discussed. As will be seen, two other water soluble monomers as well as acrylamide could be used to form the hydrogel. These are N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N-isopropylacrylamide. Alternatively, other water soluble monomers that are capable of hydrogen bonding could be used in this invention, and will form hydrogels by the grafting procedure of this invention. Those skilled in the art of water soluble polymers and hydrogels will recognize that the invention can be applied widely to many water soluble monomers to form the graft to the cage forming polyelectrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> &sect; 4.3.2 Photoinitiation of N, N-DIMETHYL Acrylamide Polymerization with the Photoinitiator-LABELED PMA in Water </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The inventors attempted to photopolymerize N,N-dimethylacrylamide by using HHMP-PMA to explore the effect of the hydrogen bonding on the gel formation as a function of pH. In case of the graft copolymer of PMA and poly(dimethyl acrylamide) (PDMAAm), in contrast to the PMA-g-PAAm, no hydrogen bonds can form between the polyacid and polyamide at high pH as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Also, since a dimethyl acrylamide is a very strong hydrogen bond acceptor, and no hydrogen bonds between PDMAAm are expected (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)), gel formation might be found at low pH. However, at low pH, the yield of the photopolymerization of N,N&prime;-dimethylacrylamide was low as was the case with acrylamide, and no gel formation was observed. This is a consequence of the cage effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Gelation, however, occurred at pH 9.4 upon polymerization. Even in the case of DMAAm monomer, at low pH where the PMA chains can form hydrophobic cages around initiator fewer grafts were obtained than at high pH. The polymer that was obtained at high pH was purified by diethyl ether. This polymer formed a weak, almost fluid-like gel in water at pH above 10, but the gel became stronger at low pH (aqueous buffer solution, pH 4.2). This indicates that there are hydrogen bonds between the acid and amide groups at low pH where the carboxylic acid groups act as a hydrogen bond donor and amide groups act as hydrogen bond acceptors. The gel in water at low pH was not as transparent as the gel obtained from the PMA-g-PAAm. This may be due to a phase separation caused by the complexation of PMA chain and PDAAm side chain (complex coacervation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The inventors also synthesized PMA-g-PAAm with 10% of the crosslinker, N, N-bisacrylamide. This cross-linked polymer formed a strong gel, but not a transparent gel, at any pH. The swelling factor of this gel was smaller than the gels obtained without cross-linker. This shows one of the advantages of a physical gel since the network can shrink and expand without the kinds of irreversible restrictions arising from covalent crosslinks found in chemical gels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inventors used the pH dependent cage effect to form a graft of PMA with N-isopropyl acrylamide in water. This system behaved as did the use of acrylamide and dimethyl acrylamide in forming a graft at high pH. In this case, however, the gel underwent a phase change at near to 32 degrees C as is well known in the art for poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in water. In this way, a hydrogel can be formed at any temperature. However, the gel lost its transparency at temperatures above about 32 degrees C as the N-isopropylacrylamide part underwent a phase separation from the water solution. This led also to a stiffening of the gel, which can be expected by those expert in the properties of hydrogels, since the isopropylacrylamide moieties would aggregate adding to the H-bonding crosslinks holding the gel at lower temperatures. This use of varying water soluble monomers demonstrates the wide applicability of the PMA labeled photoinitiator and its cage effect. In addition, it is clear that any water soluble polyelectrolyte can be labeled with a photoinitiator to form grafts. Regarding the formation of hydrogels, having the cage effect controlling the photoinitiation may not be necessary. In that case, the ability to form grafts to water soluble polymers by using copolymerized photoinitiator groups is of general use for this invention and is covered by this invention. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Forming graft copolymers in water using labeling of water soluble polymers with photoinitiators. The water soluble polymers can form environmentally responsive hydrophobically stimulated cages, which respond to pH, salt concentration, and/or the addition of water miscible solvents to the aqueous solutions. When the cage is &ldquo;closed,&rdquo; irradiation leads to radicals that cannot escape from the cage and therefore don&apos;t cause substantial polymerization of water soluble monomers in the same solution. When the cage is open via change of pH, salt concentration and/or solvent composition, the photochemically produced free radicals become exposed and cause polymerization. Under certain conditions, only graft copolymers will be formed. These graft copolymers can form a physical hydrogel in which the crosslinks are reversible. Consequently, the gel and sol states are likewise reversible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0002" lvl="0">These hydrogels and graft copolymers may also be formed by a variation of the invention in which the photoinitiator groups are covalently linked to water soluble polymers that do not form cages. In this case, water soluble monomers capable of free radical polymerization in the aqueous solution form grafts to the water soluble polymer allowing formation of physical hydrogels. The physical hydrogels formed in either case show properties responsive to pH, salt and/or solvent composition, so that the hydrogels may be rendered to a powder by addition of methanol or other non-solvents and these powders can reform the gels. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention concerns polymerization and the cage effect. These topics are introduced in &sect;&sect;1.2.1 and 1.2.2, respectively, below.

<heading lvl="1">&sect;1.2.1 PHOTOINITIATED POLYMERIZATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The field of photointiated polymerizations is a subject of intense scientific and industrial study. Many applications such as photoresists, flexographic printing plates, photopolymerizable inks, coatings, and adhesives have been widely used. Yet many aspects of photopolymerization are incompletely understood and not subject to the utmost possibility of control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Water-based photopolymerizations have a special advantage in protection of the environment. The development of water-soluble photoinitiators is under active development and new methods need to be created to control such photopolymerizations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">&sect;1.2.2 THE &ldquo;CAGE EFFECT&rdquo;</heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The concept of the &ldquo;cage effect&rdquo; was introduced in 1934 to explain why the efficiency of I<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>photodissociation was less in solution than in the gas (Frank, J.; Rabinowitch, E., <highlight><italic>Trans. Faraday Soc., </italic></highlight>30, 120 (1934). This article is incorporated herein by reference.). Frank and Rabinowitch proposed that the solvent temporarily encapsulates the reactive iodide radical atoms in a solvent cage causing the radicals to remain as colliding neighbors before they either recombine or diffuse apart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The cage effect has been widely used to explain many fundamental reaction phenomena; for example, magnetic isotope effects (Turro, N. J., <highlight><italic>J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., </italic></highlight>80, 609 (1983). Lott, W. B.; Chagovetz, A. M.; Grissom, C. B., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem.

C.; Oumar-Mahamat, H., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>112, 7369 (1990). This article is incorporated herein by reference.), variations in products and yields as a function of the medium (Koenig, T.; Deinzer, M.; Hoobler, J. A., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>93, 938 (1971). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) and variations in quantum yields as a function of the medium (Abram, I.; Milne, F.; Steel, C., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>86, 745 (1969). This article is incorporated herein by reference.). The cage effect arising from solvent is important in explaining the kinetics including the initiation, propagation, and termination steps, of radical polymerization reactions. (Odian, G., <highlight><italic>Principles of Polymerization: </italic></highlight>3<highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>ed., (Wiley-Interscience: New York, 1991). Bosch, P.; Mateo, J.

These works are incorporated herein by reference.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Since supramolecular complexation became an intense field of study, cage effects have been one of the most important issues in this field. For example, cyclodextrin has been used as a cage in the study of photochemical reactions of dibenzyl ketones. (Rao, B. N.; Turro, N. J.; Ramamurthy, V., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>51, 460 (1986). Rao, B. N.; Syamala, M. S.; Turro, N. J.; Ramamurthy, V., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>52, 5517 (1987). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) To make a long-lasting cage, people have tried to modify cage structures to cause more interactions between the host (cage) and the guest (radical pair). Among these are hydrophobic interactions in aqueous solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Recently, many researchers have focused on the study of radical recombination in micelle systems. (Gould, I. R.; Zimmt, M.

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Gels are chemically or physically cross-linked networks of polymers that can be swollen by liquids. Among the gels, a hydrogel is a network of hydrophilic polymers in which a large amount of water is present. Because of their relatively high biocompatibility, research on hydrogels has been focused on biomedical applications. (Peppas, N.

(&ldquo;Thermoreversible Gelation of Polymers and Biopolymers, by J.-M. Guenet, 1992, Academic Press. Incorporated herein by reference.) Physical gels require high cooperativity to be stable. For example, the energy involved in van der Waals interaction can be small compared to kT. Consequently, these gels can be reversible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Most physical hydrogels are biopolymers, such as gelatin gels (Katz, J. R.; Derksen, J. C.; Bon, W. F., <highlight><italic>Rec. Trav.

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> There are few examples of physical gels made by synthetic polymers. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) gels are probably the first system of this kind ever to be studied.

<heading lvl="1">&sect;1.2.3.2 INTELLIGENT HYDROGELS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The first responsive polymer gel was created by Katchalsky in 1949 by cross-linking water-soluble polyelectroyltes to form gels that swelled and shrank in response to changes in solution pH. (Katchalsky, A., <highlight><italic>Experientia, </italic></highlight>5, 319 (1949). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) That gel showed a gradual response to changes in pH. Tanaka (Tanaka, T., <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. lett., </italic></highlight>40, 820 (1978). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) observed a sharp phase transition in ionized polyacrylamide gels. Since this work, the field of responsive gels has expanded dramatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The relatively large and sharp chemical or physical changes of hydrogels in response to small chemical or physical changes has led to some hydrogels being called &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; gels.

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Hydrogen bonding is known as one of the fundamental forces to control the behavior of responsive gels.

In aqueous solutions of PAAm-PAA and in related polymer solutions, they observed temperature dependent solubility of the polymer. At low pH, they observed turbidity in the solution. They concluded that the complexation of PAA and PAAm is due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between acid and amide groups (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>.) and that this might cause precipitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Aoki et al. also have studied hydrogen-bonds between PAA and poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAAm) in interpenetrating polymer network.

In their paper, they proposed that PAA-PDMAAm gel has more efficient bonds between acid and amide than PAA-PAAm gel based on the inter- and intramolecular hydrogen-bonded complexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thermo-sensitive hydrogels are mostly made of PAAm derivatives with hydrophobic groups, because the hydrophobic interaction, which is a driving force for the gel shrinking, can be promoted by increase of the temperature. Glucose-sensitive hydrogels that are made of pH-sensitive polymers have been developed. (Klumb, L. A.; Horbett, T. A., <highlight><italic>J. Control. Release, </italic></highlight>27, 95 (1993).

A graft copolymer, which has pH-sensitive (acrylic acid) and temperature-sensitive (N-isopropyl acrylamide) components, has developed by Chen and Hoffman. (Chen, G.; Hoffman, A. S., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>373, 49 (1995). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) Another graft copolymer, but chemically cross-linked gel, of PMA and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been developed as a pH-sensitive gel by a research group in Purdue University. (Hassan, C.

<heading lvl="1">&sect;2. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention exploits a cage effect in poly(methacrylic acid) PMA, or in other polyelectrolytes with pH, salt and/or solvent dependent hydrophobic properties with guest radicals produced photochemically to control free radical polymerization. In addition, the invention includes polyelectrolytes with hydrophobic properties that are subject to addition of water miscible solvents to the water solution of the invention. Such solvents could be an alcohol. If alcohol is added to such a water solution, it could act in the same way as increase of pH and weaken the hydrophobic effect so as to effectively open the cage and release the radicals to cause polymerization of a waiting monomer in the solution. The present invention may therefore use the hydrophobic property of PMA to produce an effective pH-responsive cage for initiating radicals in aqueous solution thereby providing a free radical polymerization that can be controlled by pH, or by adding salt, or solvent to the aqueous solution. The present invention may therefore use addition of certain solvents to water solutions to alter the hydrophobic properties of PMA without substantial change of pH. Salt may also play this role. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a photoinitiator labeled PMA is synthesized with a small proportion of the initiating group (PI-PMA) (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>)) to enable a pH-triggered photopolymerization of water soluble monomers. For this strategy, hydrophobic properties of the radical pairs generated from the photoinitiator permit such radical pairs to remain in the cage long enough to recombine before they escape and initiate the polymerization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention permits the production of, via a pH-gated photopolymerization, a graft copolymer of PMA with PAAm by the polymerization of acrylamide initiated by a photoinitiator appended to PMA. This polymer forms a hydrogel containing a large amount of water for the amount of polymer present. The physically cross-linked network may be formed by inter-chain hydrogen bonding in this system. In place of acrylamide, other water soluble monomers may also be used in this invention for formation of hydrogels. For example, with N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N-isopropylacrylamide may be used. Other hydrogen bonding water soluble monomers, such as CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&boxH;CH&mdash;COOCH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>N(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and other water soluble free radical polymerizeable monomers as are well known in the art of polymerization, may also be used. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The present invention involves novel methods and compositions of matter for controlling the initiation of polymerization of monomers in water and for synthesizing new hydrogels. The present invention also involves the new hydrogels. The following description is presented to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular embodiments and methods. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments and methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles set forth below may be applied to other embodiments, methods and applications. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments and methods shown and the inventors regard their invention as the following disclosed methods, apparatus and materials and any other patentable subject matter to the extent that they are patentable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> &sect;4.1 Functions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention may function to provide a pH-responsive cage in water with guest radical pairs. The radical pairs may be used to initiate a polymerization of water-soluble reactive monomers. The radical pairs may be formed by photoinitiation. Methods and compositions of matter related to this first aspect of the invention are described in &sect;4.2 below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A second aspect of the present invention may function to provide hydrogels produced in accordance with the first aspect of the present invention. Methods and compositions of matter related to this second aspect of the invention are described in &sect;4.3 below. &sect;4.2 Cage With a Ph Release-Trigger Hosting Guest Radicals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> &sect;4.2.1 Basic Components and Properties </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Certain water-soluble monomers form a polymer in the presence of radicals. Photoinitiator radical pairs, for polymerizing water-soluble monomers in an aqueous solution, are guests to a pH responsive host cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Solubility in water can be achieved by linking ionic groups to conventional oil soluble photoinitiators, for instance, benzophenone, benzil and thioxanthone. In a recent study, photopolymerization of acrylamide in water has been investigated in the presence of water-soluble hydroxyalkylphenones (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). The hydroxyethoxy group at the para position of a phenyl ring in a photoinitiation could be used to link such a group to a poly(carboxylic acid) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>)). In the work to follow this was accomplished and with two other initiators (b and c) the esterification took also place through the tert-hydroxy group to carboxylic group of the PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> &sect;4.2.2 Exemplary Structures and Their Production </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> PMA chains, as a function of pH, form capsules around hydrophobic groups. See, S. Y. Yang, G. Schultz, M. M. Green, H. Morawetz, &ldquo;The Clustering of Poly(methacrylic acid) around Appended Binaphthyl Labels as Reflected by the Disruption of &ggr;-Cyclodextrin Complexation and Racemization Kinetics&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>32, 2577 (1999). This article is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> If the hydrophobic group is a photoinitiator of polymerization and if the PMA capsule is sufficiently stable to keep the photochemically generated radical pairs from the potentially reactive monomers, the radial pairs would recombine or participate in some transfer reaction rather than initiating the polymerization. This effect, a so-called &ldquo;cage effect&rdquo;, has been studied for a long time, from the case of solvent cages (Tanner, D. D.; Meintzer, C. P.; Tsai, E. C.; Oumar-Mahamat, H., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>112, 7369 (1990). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) to the &ldquo;super cage effect&rdquo; on radical polymerizations (Bosch, P.; Mateo, J. L.; Serrano, J., J. <highlight><italic>Photochem. Photobiol. A, </italic></highlight>103, 177 (1997). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) including emulsion polymerizations (Encinas, M. V.; Lissi, E. A., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci. Polym. Chem. Ed., </italic></highlight>2157 (1983). Torii, H.; Fujimoto, K.; Kawaguchi, H., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci. Part A Polym Chem., </italic></highlight>34, 1237 (1996). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.), photochemical degradation of polymers (Male, J. L.; Yoon, M. G.; Glenn, A. G.; R., W. T. J.; Tyler, D. R., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>32, 3898 (1999). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) and cyclodextrin host-gurest chemistry. (Rao, B. N.; Turro, N. J.; Ramamurthy, V., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>51, 460 (1986). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) However, the inventors believe that a photopolymerization triggered by a cage that opens and closes as a function of change in pH in water, or as a function of salt concentration, or as a function of the concentration of solvents to the aqueous solution has not appeared in the literature. The inventors designed a system to test the effect of the PMA ability to form hydrophobic stimulated cages on the photopolymerization of some water-soluble monomers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> While PMA is preferred for use as the cage for this invention, it is not unique in its ability to form cages about hydrophobic groups. For example poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) also shows this property and as well certain polymers designated as polysoaps. Other polymers with this property are known, and include, for example, CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&boxH;C(C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)&mdash;COOH. Therefore, the present invention is not restricted to PMA. Further, the invention is not restricted to the photoiniatiators shown here since it can easily be recognized in the art that a wide variety of photoinitiators forming radicals on irradiation or causing radicals to form via interaction with other molecules fit into the general description of the photoinitiators described. The photoinitiator is preferably capable of forming a covalent bond to the polyelectrolyte, which can be PMA or other polyelectrolytes, as noted above. In addition, for the purposes of this invention, photoinitiators may be synthesized allowing their attachment to the chain and with groups that alter their hydrophobicity as is well known in the art of photochemistry and organic chemistry. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">&sect;4.2.2.1 Synthesizing Photoinitiable Pmas and Control Experiments </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The inventors designed poly(methacrylic acid)s (&ldquo;PMAs&rdquo;) that contain photoinitiator groups in the side chain. Photoinitiators are usually divided according to the reaction mechanism into two classes&mdash;so called Type I and Type II photoinitiators. Upon irradiation, the Type I photoinitiators undergo fragmentation to yield initiating radicals. Type II photoinitiators do not fragment upon irradiation; rather they need to react with other molecules to generate the radicals. This post-fragmentation reaction usually occurs via either a hydrogen abstraction by the excited initiator or a photoinduced electron transfer followed by fragmentation. Those skilled in the art of polymerization and cage effects will easily recognize that Type II photoinitiators can also be used in this invention although the invention is demonstrated with Type I effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment, Type I photoinitiators were used with the PMA cluster as a radical cage. Most Type I photoinitiators contain a carbonyl group substituted with an aromatic group and a tertiary alkyl group. The alkyl group is often substituted with an electron withdrawing group assisting the photofragmentation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the fragmentation mechanism of the photoinitiator in one embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Depending on the nature of the substituent group, the fragmentation can occur at a bond adjacent to the carbonyl group (&agr;-cleavage), or at a &bgr;-position to the aromatic carbonyl (&bgr;-cleavage). The most usual fragmentation of the photoinitiator is &agr;-cleavage and the benzoyl radicals that are formed by &agr;-cleavage are known to be sufficiently reactive to induce polymerization in vinyl monomers. When the fragmentation in the photoinitiator takes place at the a-position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is called a Norrish type I reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the structures of the photoinitiators and the synthetic method used in this embodiment. The photoinitiators (FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>)) have reactive hydroxyl groups, which can react with methacryloyl chloride to form the photoinitiable monomers. 2-Hydroxy-4&prime;-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methyl propiophenone (&ldquo;HHMP&rdquo;) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) has two reactive hydroxyl groups: a primary hydroxyl group and an &agr;-hydroxyl group. 1-Hydroxy cyclohexyl phenyl ketone (&ldquo;HCPK&rdquo;) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and benzoin (&ldquo;BZ&rdquo;) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) have only an a-hydroxyl group adjacent to the benzoyl group in which the bond cleavage occurs. The esterification of the primary hydroxy group in HHMP does not change the reactivity of the fragmentation of the photoinitiator. However, it is expected that the reactivity of the bond cleavage in HCPK and BZ will decrease when appended to the polymer. After the reaction of HHMP with methacryloyl chloride, the product (monomer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>)) could be easily isolated from a mixture with the minor product of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) by column chromatography. Photoinitiable polymers were obtained by copolymerization of the photoinitiable monomers of FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>) with methacrylic acid monomer initiated by AIBN in 1,4-dioxane at 65&deg;C. At this temperature, the photoinitiator was stable and the labeling percentage could be easily varied. The polymer was dissolved in methanol and purified by precipitation in acetone or diethyl ether. The other two photoinitiators, HCPK and BZ, were also attached to PMA using the same method as for the HHMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The labeling percentages of the photoinitiators were determined by UW spectroscopy based on the extinction coefficients of the free photoinitiators in methanol. Table 1 contains the extinction coefficients and the maximum wavelengths for the UV absorption spectra of each photoinitiator.

<heading lvl="1">4.2.2.2 Control Experiment: the Unbound Photoinitiator: Spectroscopic Study and Photoinitiation of Acrylamide at Different pHs </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to study the behavior of the photoinitiator in water, both alone and in the presence of PMA, before further study of the photoinitiator bound to the polymer. However, to be used in such a study, the photoinitiator should be soluble in water. Among the photoinitiators attached to the PMA in accordance with the present invention, HHMP (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.) has good solubility in water because of the para-(hydroxyethoxy) group on the benzene ring. Other photoinitiators may be too hydrophobic to be soluble in water. Therefore, the HHMP initiator is one photoinitiator that the inventors studied in the unbound state. As will be discussed below, the fluorescence of the unbound HHMP, and its complexation with cyclodextrin has also been studied by the inventors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The inventors also studied the initiation of the acrylamide polymerization by HHMP in the presence of PMA (unbound to the polymer). Chain characteristics for PMA with respect to hydrophobic moieties similar to those reported in the literature were expected. The aromatic residue of the photoinitiator, therefore, should be adsorbed to the PMA at low pH, as reported for other aromatics (Barone, G.; Crescenzi, V.; Liquori, A. M.; Quadrifoglio, F., <highlight><italic>J. Phys. Chem., </italic></highlight>71, 2341 (1967). Barone, G.; Crescenzi, V.; Pispisa, B.; Quadrifoglio, F., <highlight><italic>J. Macomol.

These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) whose solubility in water is enhanced in the presence of PMA. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">4.2.2.2.1 Control Experiment: Fluorescence of the Unbound Hhmp </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The HHMP photoinitiator (6.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>M) was dissolved in aqueous 0.01M PMA. The fluorescence spectrum of the solution was measured at varying pH. The results showed the effect of the cluster formation of PMA around the aromatic photoinitiator on the emission intensity even when the initiator is not covalently attached to the PMA. The fluorescence spectra were obtained from the aqueous solution of the HHMP photoinitiator without PMA and compared with the spectra obtained from the photoinitiator in the presence of PMA. The emission intensity of the photoinitiator that was adsorbed on the PMA, at low pH, was increased on lowering the pH, whereas the emission intensity of the photoinitiator without PMA was decreased with lowering of the pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A transition behavior, that is, a steep change in property at near to pH 5.5, in the fluorescence intensity of the unbound HHMP was observed in the PMA solution as a function of pH. This transition was also observed in the cyclodextrin complexation with the photoinitiator labeled PMA, which will be discussed below and both effects arise from the opening and closing of the cage around this pH. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The circular dichroism of the photoinitiator in the presence of the cyclodextrin was measured with and without the PMA solution. &agr;-, &bgr;- or &lgr;-Cyclodextrins were used. HHMP forms a complex only with &bgr;-cyclodextrin, which is demonstrated by an induced circular dichroism (ICD) from 320 nm to 210 nm. Complexation with &agr;- or &lgr;-cyclodextrin could not be detected. The ICD of the complex did not change with varying pH. However, the ICD produced by the complexation of the aromatic photoinitiator HHMP with &agr;-cyclodextrin was also observed at all pH&apos;s even in the presence of PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in spite of the pH dependence of the fluorescence intensity of the aromatic photoinitiator in the presence of the PMA, the cyclodextrin complexation results indicate that the HHMP adsorbed in the PMA at low pH, as evidenced by the fluorescence data, still can interact with cyclodextrin. This observation demonstrates that the invention will work when the photoinitiator is covalently bound to the polyelectrolyte capable of the cage effect, as for example PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the absence of the cyclodextrin, the aromatic photoinitiator HHMP can be adsorbed in the PMA cluster at low pH as evidenced by the enhanced fluorescence. However, when the cyclodextrin is present in the solution, the HHMP molecules may diffuse out of the PMA cluster and complex with the cyclodextrin. This may indicate that the HHMP is more stable in a complex with the cyclodextrin than in the PMA cluster. If the aromatic chromophore that was absorbed in the PMA has very poor solubility in water, the barrier of the route to the cyclodextrin through the water phase may be too high at any pH. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the inventors chose acrylamide (AAm) as a water-soluble monomer because polyacrylamide is soluble in water, independent of pH. Furthermore, polyacrylamide (PAAm) can be isolated from a mixture with PMA by precipitation into methanol, which is a good solvent for PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As a control experiment, the photoinitiation of acrylamide by free HHMP at different pH&apos;s was studied and no detectable change in polymer yield was found. The effect of the PMA on the photoinitiation of the acrylamide was then studied. The same experiment in the presence of PMA led to similar results, although a small difference was observed between the polymerization tubes at low and high pH&apos;s. Below pH 4, turbidity was observed after 10 minutes of irradiation. This might have arisen by a phase separation, which is known to be caused by the complexation between PMA and PAAm. (Silberberg, A.; Eliassaf, J.; Katchalsky, A., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci., </italic></highlight>23, 259 (1957).

However, the yield of the PAAm was not affected significantly by this precipitation, showing that the free photoinitiators are equally reactive at different pH&apos;s, regardless of the conformational change of PMA. </paragraph>

As described below, this also leads to the formation of graft copolymers with hydrogel and other potentially useful properties. In the embodiments discussed below, three aromatic photoinitiators were chosen as pendent molecules for the PMA. All photoinitiators in this embodiment have hydrophobic character and have a Norrish type I cleavage mechanism for the fragmentation. They were attached to the PMA by the copolymerization of each monomer with methacrylic acid as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Most of the radical pairing kinetic studies of fragmented radicals upon irradiation have been carried out by laser flash photolysis with monitoring by electron spin resonance (ESR). (Wu, C.-H.; Jenks, W. S.; Koptyug, I. V.; Ghatlia, N. D.; Lipson, M.; Tarasov, V. F.; Turro, N. J., <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </italic></highlight>115, 9583 (1993). Eichler, J.; Herz, C.

Perkin Trans., </italic></highlight>2, 2469 (1999). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) Irradiation events were followed using the UV absorption spectroscopy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> When the chromophores are fragmented, basically, their absorption spectra will change. If the radical pair recombines forming the original molecule, the UV absorption spectra will be maintained. This recombination reaction will reduce the radicals available to initiate polymerization or to decompose in other ways. Thus, in the absence of monomer molecules, the more frequently the recombination occurs, the slower the overall conversion to decomposition products will be. Therefore, the inventors studied the kinetics of the decay in the UV absorption maximum at different pH&apos;s to gather information on the clustering effect of PMA. To measure the decay rate of the UV absorption of the photoinitiator, the UV spectrum of the solution was measured before and after each irradiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Decay of the absorption band of HHMP (&lgr;<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&tilde;278 nm) in the HHMP labeled PMA (HHMP-PMA) was too fast to be followed at all pH&apos;s upon irradiation by a medium pressure mercury lamp with a maximum wavelength at 365 nm. In the case of the benzoin labeled PMA (BZ-PMA), the decay rate at first was fast (30 minutes), slowing down after further irradiation. The UV decay rate of HCPK-PMA was slow compared to the other systems and therefore the kinetics of the UV decay could be followed more precisely. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the intensity of the UV absorption of the HCPK-PMA at all pH&apos;s studied decreased without any spectral shift or change of shape in the range of the original UV absorption wavelength, showing that the original structure of the initiator mainly contributes to the spectra. A recombination process, if it occurs, will reduce the decay rate of UV absorption in this wavelength range while decomposition must produce molecules without or with UV absorption in this wavelength range. The results of these kinetic measurements are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), where the logarithm of the ratio of the UV absorbance after and before irradiation was plotted versus time as a function of pH. The absorption decay showed pseudo-first-order kinetics and the rate constants (kobs) were obtained from the slopes of the first order plots shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the dependence of the decay rate on the pH is shown. Compared to the decay rate at high pH, the rates become slow at low pH where the PMA is known to form a cluster around the label. At pH&apos;s below 6, the UV absorbance of the pendent photoinitiator decreases to about 50% compared to the value at high pH. This clearly shows a transition corresponding to the transition from the cluster to the extended chain conformation of the PMA. This was also observed in the pH dependent complexation of HCPK-PMA with cyclodextrin as discussed below. When the polymer solution (HCPK-PMA) was irradiated in the presence of &lgr;-cyclodextrin at high pH, where the photoinitiating pendent is complexed with cyclodextrin, a slower cleavage rate was observed in the absence of the cyclodextrin (data are marked as CyD in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)) demonstrating the cage effect of the cyclodextrin. (Rao, B. N.; Syamala, M. S.; Turro, N. J.; Ramamurthy, V., <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem., </italic></highlight>52, 5517 (1987). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) No cage effect of the cyclodextrin was observed in the case of HHMP-PMA upon irradiation at high pH. Although &bgr;-cyclodextrin formed a complex with the pendent initiator HHMP at high pH, revealed by the induced circular dichroism (to be discussed in the following section), cyclodextrin was not effective in protecting the photoinitiator from bond cleavage leading to decomposition. Consequently, the inventors believe that because the HHMP pendent group has a long spacer (ethoxyhydroxy group) between it and the polymer backbone, the cyclodextrin may be able to move along the spacer. (Harada, A.; Kamachi, M., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>23, 2821 (1990). This article is incorporated herein by reference.), and therefore the cyclodextrin complex may not provide a tight enough fit for the cage effect. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The cyclodextrin complexations with aromatic photoinitiators appended to PMA were measured at various pH. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the circular dichroism, which was induced by complexation with &bgr;-cyclodextrin, of the HHMP appended to the PMA as a function of pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> No signal was observed at a pH below 6. However, when the pH of the solution is higher than about 6, the ICD signal increased sharply. This signal can be reversibly turned on and off by change of the pH around the critical transition pH. This differs from the interaction of the unbound HHMP with cyclodextrin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Based on the results of the fluorescence of the HHMP in the presence of PMA, the inventors believe that the HHMP was adsorbed in the PMA at low pH and protected from contact of water. However, the HHMP adsorbed in the PMA at low pH could still interact with the cyclodextrin, which was revealed by the ICD signal at low pH. In the covalently bound system of the HHMP, the results of the cyclodextrin experiment suggest that the HHMP labels have a much stronger interaction with the PMA cluster than when it is not covalently attached to the PMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Similar to the HHMP-PMA, the benzoin-labeled PMA (BZ-PMA) forms a complex only with &bgr;-cyclodextrin. An induced circular dichroism spectrum of the complex between the BZ labels and &bgr;-cyclodextrin shows a peak with maximum around 250 nm. Because of the high extinction coefficient compared to the other photoinitiators at UV absorption peak in the range of 350-220 nm, the complex of the BZ label and cyclodextrin exhibits the highest ICD value. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the induced circular dichroism of the BZ-PMA plotted versus pH. It shows a very sharp transition within several tenths of a pH unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) exhibit the ICD of the HCPK-PMA with cyclodextrins as a function of pH. The HCPK labels can complex with either &bgr;- or &lgr;-cyclodextrin, which differs from the properties of the other initiators (HHMP and BZ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The &lgr;-cyclodextrin complex with the HCPK label gave a larger signal than the &bgr;-cyclodextrin. In both cases, a typical sharp transition of the ICD was observed at pH near 6. This transition pH is similar to the transition observed in the UV irradiation experiment, which was discussed in the previous section. As before, the reversible complexation with the cyclodextrin predicts the pH dependent cage effect in the absence of the cyclodextrin and on exposure to light to form the radicals. This cage effect could also be affected by changing salt concentration, and/or by adding or removing water miscible solvents, such as alcohols for example. The basis for this can be found in the article: S. Y. Yang, G. Schultz, M. M. Green, H. Morawetz, &ldquo;The Clustering of Poly(methacrylic acid) around Appended Binaphthyl Labels as Reflected by the Disruption of &ggr;-Cyclodextrin Complexation and Racemization Kinetics&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>32, 2577 (1999).

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> For this study, each photoinitiator appended PMA sample was dissolved in distilled water with a concentration of 0.1M and placed in the UV cell. Then, the solution was irradiated by UV light (&lgr;max &tilde;365 nm, medium pressure mercury lamp, Model 100AP from UVP) 15 minutes each, three times. UV spectrum of the solution was taken before and after each irradiation. The apparent bond cleavage rate of the each photoinitiator was determined from the graph that was plotted by the equation below.

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The PMA clustering effect on the unbound and bound photoinitiators by means of the spectroscopic measurements was described in &sect;4.2 above. The photoinitiation of a water-soluble monomer, acrylamide, with the photoinitiator appended to PMA (PI-PMA) is now described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, to avoid a viscosity effect of the initiator labeled polymer solution on the polymerization of acrylamide, the concentration of the PI-PMA was controlled to 0.01 M and 0.1 M monomer was added to the solution. In the following exemplary embodiments, photoinitiator-appended PMA&apos;s were synthesized with three different photoinitiators. The HHMP-appended PMA is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> &sect;4.3.1.1 Photopolymerization of Acrylamide By Hhmp-Pma as a Function of pH </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the following exemplary embodiments, the photopolymerization of acrylamide by the HHMP appended to PMA was tested at four different pH&apos;s. The pH&apos;s of solutions were adjusted to 4.2, 5.43, 6.38 and 9.4, respectively. Upon irradiation, the reaction mixture at pH 4.2 turned slightly turbid and a trace amount of white precipitate was obtained. The viscosity of the solution at pH 5.43 was hardly changed upon irradiation and the solution remained clear. At pH&apos;s of 6.38 and 9.4, gelation occurred after several minutes of irradiation. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In each case, these gels were taken out from the tube and washed with large amounts of distilled water. Precipitation into methanol gave a completely contracted powder of the gel. This powder form of the polymer reforms a hydrogel by adding water. Interestingly, the strength of the gel depends on the method of precipitation of the polymer in methanol. More specifically, the absence of stirring leads to a slow contraction of the polymer and allows the gelled polymer to have one piece of white precipitate. When stirring was applied to the precipitation process, the polymer was torn apart to little pieces of white powder. In both cases, the polymer forms a gel by adding water. However, the gel that was obtained from the precipitates in the absence of stirring exhibited stronger gel properties as judged by approximate rheological testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> When fragmentation of the photoinitiator takes place, there can be two radicals in the system. One is a benzoyl radical which is attached to the polymer backbone. The other is a ketyl radical which can be freely released from the polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> If the benzoyl radical initiates the polymerization of the acrylamide monomer, it generates a graft copolymer. On the other hand, if the released ketyl radicals initiate polymerization, this may lead to linear polyacrylamide. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates these two probable polymer formation routes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> It was widely believed that the ketyl radicals (2-hydroxy-2-propyl radical) are less reactive than benzoyl radicals and do not contribute to the initiation of the polymerization. (See, e.g., Dietliker, K., <highlight><italic>Photoinitiators for Free Radical and Cationic Polymerization </italic></highlight>(SITA Technology: London, 1991) Vol. 3. This work is incorporated herein by reference.) However, a paper recently published claims that the ketyl radical is more reactive than benzyl radical. (Vacek, K. G.; Beckert D.; Mehanert R., <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., </italic></highlight>2, 2469 (1999). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) However, the inventors found that when acrylamide was polymerized with the photoinitiator-labeled PMA at pH 9.4, a linear polyacrylamide was not obtained. The residue from the rinsing water was examined after filtering the gel. There was no evidence for the presence of the linear polymer. At high pH, the ketyl radicals could change to the corresponding anion. These anions may not be effective for initiation as much as the uncharged radicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In practicing this embodiment of the invention, even if some ketyl radicals freely escaped from the PMA cluster and could initiate polymerization of acrylamide, this would produce only a linear polyacrylamide, which is soluble in water. Since linear polymers of PAAm and PMA are water soluble, the gels that were obtained at high pH&apos;s, which were washed with a large excess of water, could not be homopolymers. Therefore, they were certainly graft-copolymers of PMA and PAAm (PMA-g-PAAm) as drawn in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Linear polymers of PMA and PAAm were mixed in water, as a control experiment. Both polymers were miscible and the solution mixture was clear until the pH of the solution was lowered below 4. At very low pH, turbidity in the mixture was observed. Presumably, this precipitation was caused by the complexation of PMA and PAAm via hydrogen bonding between acid and amide groups, to be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The initiating reactivity of the benzoyl radical toward the acrylamide monomer can be measured by the degree of the polymerization of the grafted polymer, which may be an indicator of the cage effect of the PMA cluster. The degree of the polymerization (DP) of polyacrylamide in the graft copolymer was determined by nitrogen analysis of the isolated polymer (elemental analysis). Information about the degree of the polymerization (DP) and the initiator labeling percentage of the photoinitiator-labeled PMA was predetermined. Using this information, the DP of the PAAm part in the sample can be determined based on the ratio of carbon and nitrogen percentages by equation 11 and 12 with the parameters (x, y, n<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>, n<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, Z). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows the structure of the PMA-g-PAAm along with the structure of the initiator-containing HHMP-PMA. The number of carbons in equation 1 is based on the numbers from the HHMP-PMA and PAAm and the numbers of nitrogen comes only from PAAm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The number of the repeating units (n, DP) of the whole chain of the HHMP-PMA was calculated to be 9880, which is based on the molecular weight that was measured by GPC, when calculated according to the composition of HHMP-PMA, the number of the methacrylic acid and photoinitiator labeled methacrylate grafts is 9700 and 150 respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The number of carbons in the PMA-g-PAAm is 4 from the MA unit, 13 from the HHMP-MA units and 3 for the AAm unit. In case of the nitrogen, the number is one; it only comes from the AAm unit. Therefore, the total number of repeating units of the AAm can be determined based on the carbon and the nitrogen ratio by the following equations (12). The average DP of grafting (average number of Z in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) was calculated by dividing the total number of PAAm units in a macromolecule by the total number of the HHMP-MA units in a macromolecule (n<highlight><subscript>B</subscript></highlight>&equals;150), assuming that all photoinitiators lead to the same grafting (table 4). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The gel polymer samples for the elemental analysis were purified by washing them with a large excess of water and precipitation into methanol. Methanol should remove any unreacted PMA or acrylamide monomer from the sample. Samples for the low pH solutions were isolated by adding concentrated HCl into the solution (since PMA is known to be precipitated by concentrated HCl). The precipitates, therefore, should contain mainly PMA with or without the grafted PAAm chains. The results of the elemental analyses of theses samples are listed in Table 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In general, the degree of the polymerization of acrylamide increased with an increase of pH of the reaction mixture. The data in the last row in Table 4 were obtained from stepwise irradiation of the sample at different pH&apos;s. It was initially irradiated at pH 5.4 for 15 minutes. Then the pH of the solution was raised to pH 9.4 followed by irradiation for an additional 15 minutes. The 2nd irradiation yielded a very viscous solution and fibrous white powders could be isolated on addition of methanol to the mixture. This isolated white powder forms a gel.

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As shown in the Table 4, this precipitate contains a large portion of AAm chains (DP&equals;33200), which is close to the value obtained in a one step irradiation at pH 9.4 and still more than three times larger than the value from one step irradiation at pH 5.4. This indicates that some portions of the initiators at pH 5.4 can recombine inside of the PMA cluster upon irradiation and still can produce active radicals later when the pH is increased to open the PMA clusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> However, when the same experiment as described above was performed with the sample at pH 4.2, no further reaction occurred. The viscosity of the solution was not changed and no more polymers were isolated. This indicates that the cage effect causes recombination of the photochemically produced radicals at pH 5.4, but not at the lower pH. At the lower pH, the cage, although restricting the radicals from causing polymerization in the water solution, nevertheless allows radical reactions that destroy the initial photoinitiator structure. </paragraph>

This white powder reformed a gel in water and contracted in methanol reversibly. Precipitates without stirring performs stronger gel formation than the powder prepared by stirring. </paragraph>

As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the gel swells even at low pH and the swelling ratio was increased smoothly by the increase of the pH of the soaking solution. At high pH, the swelling factor was increased to more than two orders of magnitude of the weight of the dried sample. This polymer may be a &ldquo;superabsorbant&rdquo; hydrogel. (DeRossi, D., <highlight><italic>Polymer Gels </italic></highlight>(Plenum Press: New York, 1991). This work is incorporated herein by reference.) Briefly stated, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the pH reversible swelling behavior of the gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Two pieces of the polymer powder with the same weight were prepared and each of them was immersed in the buffer solutions at pH 4.2 and 9.6, respectively, for 24 hours. The excess of the solutions was decanted and the buffer solutions were switched. That is, the swollen gel at pH 4.2 was put into the pH 9.6 buffer solution and the swollen gel at pH 9.6 was placed into the pH 4.2 buffer solution. After 24 hours of immersion, the extra solution was discarded and the gel weighed. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the contraction of the gel that was swollen at high pH first and contracted at low pH, reached the equilibrium value within 24 hours. However, the gel swollen at low pH first swelled slowly at high pH. It took 4 days to reach the usual swelling ratio observed at the high pH. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The inventors believe that hydrogen bonding between acid and amide may be the driving force of the hydrogel formation. Hydrogen bonding is known to make an interpenetrating gel network (IPN) of PAA and PAAm (Katono, H.; Maruyama, A.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>J. Controlled Release, </italic></highlight>16, 215 (1991). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) or PDMAAm. (Aoki, T.; Masahiko, K.; Katono, H.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>Macromoleecules, </italic></highlight>27, 947 (1994). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) PAAm and PAA are known to complex with polymers which are hydrogen bonds acceptors. (Silberberg, A.; Eliassaf, J.; Katchalsky, A., <highlight><italic>J. Polym. Sci., </italic></highlight>23, 259 (1957). Wang, Y.; Morawetz, H., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>22, 164 (1989). Katono, H.; Maruyama, A.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>J. Controlled Release, </italic></highlight>16, 215 (1991). These articles are incorporated herein by reference.) At low temperature, the two polymers form complexes by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, resulting in dehydration and precipitation. At higher temperature, the hydrogen bonds of the complex dissociate leading to the solubilization of the polymers. (Katono, H.; Maruyama, A.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>J. Controlled Release, </italic></highlight>16, 215 (1991). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Since the polymerization was carried out in the absence of crosslinking agent such as N,N,-bisacrylamide, another possibility of gel formation is by crosslinking via recombination of two growing grafted chains. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>.) However, this possibility is inconsistent with the observation that the polymer gel dissolved in 7.0 M urea aqueous solution (room temperature with stirring). Urea has been used to break the hydrogen bonds between acid-amide chains that exist in PAA and PAAm or PDMAAm by many researchers including Aoki et al. (Aoki, T.; Masahiko, K.; Katono, H.; Sanui, K.; Ogata, N.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y., <highlight><italic>Macromoleecules, </italic></highlight>27, 947 (1994). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) After removing of urea by dialysis, the graft copolymer was isolated by adding methanol and it reformed the gel. Urea is a well known denaturant for breaking of hydrogen bonds in proteins or DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> It was expected, therefore, that the hydrogen bonding between acids and amides might play an important role in the PMA-g-PAAm hydrogel system. Hydrogen bonds would connect the whole system forming a physical gel in an aqueous system without precipitation. However, since the gel existed at all pH&apos;s, there should still be some of hydrogen bonding interaction between chains even at high pH where most &mdash;CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H groups are converted to &mdash;CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&mdash;</superscript></highlight> (FIG. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> PMA-g-PAAm is a copolymer with a high density of grafts (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>.), which may cause difficulty in hydrogen bonding between carboxylic groups and amides. The number of the acrylamide (AAm) repeating units in the graft (300) is about 5 times larger than the number of the methacrylic acid (MA) repeating units between grafting points (65), which was estimated by dividing the total number of the HHMP-PMA unit (9880) by the total number of HHMP-MA unit (150). It may be difficult for a grafted PAAm chain to penetrate into the other PAAm grafted chains on the other PMA chain to reach the carboxylic groups of the PMA. Therefore, amide-amide interactions, as well as amide-acid interactions, may contribute significantly to the network formation. Hydrogen bonds between amide groups in PAAm could be the reason why the complexes between PDMAAm and PAA dissociate at higher temperature (70&deg; C.) than PAAm-PAA complexes (25&deg; C.). Alkylated amide groups in PDMAAm only can act as hydrogen acceptors, therefore, there is no intramolecular hydrogen bonds in PAAm. On the other hand, amide groups in PAAm can be hydrogen-bond donors or acceptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Although gels have been intensively studied for decades, there are only relatively few examples of physical gels in water, that is, that are not covalently crosslinked. As mentioned in &sect;1.2.3.1 above, most are biopolymers. Further, physical cross-linking requires high concentration of the polymer. In the examples described, gelation occurred in very dilute solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Graft copolymer gels are a relatively new subject in hydrogel research. A graft copolymer of PMA and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has been developed for a gel, which responds to the pH change of the system with a change of volume. (Hassan, C. M.; Doyle III, F. J.; Peppas, N. A., <highlight><italic>Macromolecules, </italic></highlight>30, 6166 (1997). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) However, this copolymer is actually not a purely grafted copolymer but a chemically crosslinked network using the cross-linker, N,N&prime;-bisacrylamide. Hoffman et al. (Chen, G.; Hoffman, A. S., <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>373, 49 (1995). This article is incorporated herein by reference.) reported a graft copolymer consists of PNIPAAm and PAA, which exhibit temperature-induced phase transition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The inventors can demonstrate that the gel described here is not chemically cross-linked since it dissolves in urea solution. After the urea was removed by dialysis and methanol, this polymer still formed a gel. In the following section, the hydrogen bonding interaction in the gel using a graft copolymer of the stronger hydrogen bond acceptor N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMAAm) is discussed. As will be seen, two other water soluble monomers as well as acrylamide could be used to form the hydrogel. These are N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N-isopropylacrylamide. Alternatively, other water soluble monomers that are capable of hydrogen bonding could be used in this invention, and will form hydrogels by the grafting procedure of this invention. Those skilled in the art of water soluble polymers and hydrogels will recognize that the invention can be applied widely to many water soluble monomers to form the graft to the cage forming polyelectrolyte. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">&sect;4.3.2 Photoinitiation of N, N-Dimethyl Acrylamide Polymerization with the Photoinitiator-Labeled Pma in Water </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The inventors attempted to photopolymerize N,N-dimethylacrylamide by using HHMP-PMA to explore the effect of the hydrogen bonding on the gel formation as a function of pH. In case of the graft copolymer of PMA and poly(dimethyl acrylamide) (PDMAAm), in contrast to the PMA-g-PAAm, no hydrogen bonds can form between the polyacid and polyamide at high pH as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Also, since a dimethyl acrylamide is a very strong hydrogen bond acceptor, and no hydrogen bonds between PDMAAm are expected (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)), gel formation might be found at low pH. However, at low pH, the yield of the photopolymerization of N,N&prime;-dimethylacrylamide was low as was the case with acrylamide, and no gel formation was observed. This is a consequence of the cage effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Gelation, however, occurred at pH 9.4 upon polymerization. Even in the case of DMAAm monomer, at low pH where the PMA chains can form hydrophobic cages around initiator fewer grafts were obtained than at high pH. The polymer that was obtained at high pH was purified by diethyl ether. This polymer formed a weak, almost fluid-like gel in water at pH above 10, but the gel became stronger at low pH (aqueous buffer solution, pH 4.2). This indicates that there are hydrogen bonds between the acid and amide groups at low pH where the carboxylic acid groups act as a hydrogen bond donor and amide groups act as hydrogen bond acceptors. The gel in water at low pH was not as transparent as the gel obtained from the PMA-g-PAAm. This may be due to a phase separation caused by the complexation of PMA chain and PDAAm side chain (complex coacervation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The inventors also synthesized PMA-g-PAAm with 10% of the crosslinker, N,N-bisacrylamide. This cross-linked polymer formed a strong gel, but not a transparent gel, at any pH. The swelling factor of this gel was smaller than the gels obtained without cross-linker. This shows one of the advantages of a physical gel since the network can shrink and expand without the kinds of irreversible restrictions arising from covalent crosslinks found in chemical gels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inventors used the pH dependent cage effect to form a graft of PMA with N-isopropyl acrylamide in water. This system behaved as did the use of acrylamide and dimethyl acrylamide in forming a graft at high pH. In this case, however, the gel underwent a phase change at near to 32 degrees C. as is well known in the art for poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in water. In this way, a hydrogel can be formed at any temperature. However, the gel lost its transparency at temperatures above about 32 degrees C. as the N-isopropylacrylamide part underwent a phase separation from the water solution. This led also to a stiffening of the gel, which can be expected by those expert in the properties of hydrogels, since the isopropylacrylamide moieties would aggregate adding to the H-bonding crosslinks holding the gel at lower temperatures. This use of varying water soluble monomers demonstrates the wide applicability of the PMA labeled photoinitiator and its cage effect. In addition, it is clear that any water soluble polyelectrolyte can be labeled with a photoinitiator to form grafts. Regarding the formation of hydrogels, having the cage effect controlling the photoinitiation may not be necessary. In that case, the ability to form grafts to water soluble polymers by using copolymerized photoinitiator groups is of general use for this invention and is covered by this invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> ACS and pPDH are two enzymes that are responsible for the generation of acetyl CoA in the plastids, e.g., chloroplasts, of plants. ACS generates acetyl CoA as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>acetate&plus;ATP&plus;CoASH&rarr;acetyl-CoA&plus;AMP&plus;PP<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> wherein ATP represents adenine triphosphate, CoASH represents coenzyme A, acetyl-CoA represents acetyl coenzyme A, AMP represents adenine monophosphate, and PP1 represents inorganic pyrophosphate, and wherein the acetate includes that which results from the conversion of acetaldehyde and NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> to acetate and NADH, wherein the acetaldehyde, in turn, results from the breakdown of pyruvate, which releases CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. pPDH generates acetyl CoA as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>pyruvate&plus;CoASH&plus;NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rarr;acetyl-CoA&plus;CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;NADH, </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> wherein NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> represents nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and NADH represents the reduced form of NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and wherein the pyruvate results from glycolysis. Glycolysis involves the conversion of sugar phosphates, which have been produced from starch, photosynthesis or the importation of triose and hexose phosphates from the cytosol, to pyruvate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Various studies of relative activity of enzymes in embryos and leaves of plants, such as spinach, castor bean, barley and Brassica have been conducted (see, Kang and Rawsthome, <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>6: 795-805 (1994); Miernyk and Dennis, <highlight><italic>J. Exper. Bot. </italic></highlight>34: 712-718 (1983); Smith et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>98: 1233-1238 (1992); Liedvogel and Bauerle, <highlight><italic>Planta </italic></highlight>169: 481-489 (1986); Murphy and Leech, <highlight><italic>FEBS Letter </italic></highlight>77: 164168 (1977); Roughan et al., <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>158: 593-601 (1976); Roughan et al., <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>184: 565-569 (1978); Roughan et al., <highlight><italic>Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>184: 193-202 (1979); Springer and Heise, <highlight><italic>Planta </italic></highlight>177: 417-421 (1989); Schulze-Siebert and Shultz, Plant Physiol 84: 1233-1237(1987); and Heintze et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>93: 1121-1127 (1990)). Such studies suggest that acetate is the preferred substrate for fatty acid synthesis in chloroplasts, while pyruvate is the preferred substrate for fatty acid synthesis in plastids in embryos. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The acetyl CoA so produced is then involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, i.e., the synthesis of the basic building blocks of membrane lipids, fats and waxes. A similar reaction is effected by mtPDH in the mitochondrion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> ACS is exclusively found in the plastids of plants and is strongly regulated by light (Sauer and Heise, <highlight><italic>Z. Naturforsch </italic></highlight>38c: 399-404 (1983)). The amount of ACS is fairly constant between spinach, pea and amaranthus chloroplasts; there is about 20% more in corn chloroplasts. Given that the partially purified enzyme is completely DTT-dependent suggests that its activity in vivo may be regulated by the ferredoxin/thioredoxin system (Zeiher and Randall, <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>96: 382-389 (1991)). There is some potential for weak feedback inhibition by acetyl CoA. The enzyme also has a high pH requirement, along with a dependency on a high ATP(Mg<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight>-ATP)/ADP ratio (Sauer and Heise (1983), supra). The ACS reaction should be substrate saturated because K<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>values for acetate are between 0.02 and 0.10 mM in spinach (Sauer and Heise (1983), supra; Zeiher and Randall (1991), supra; and Treede and Heise, <highlight><italic>Z. Naturforsch </italic></highlight>40c: 496-502 (1985)), peas (Treede and Heise (1985), supra), amaranthus (Roughan and Ohlrogge, <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>216: 77-82 (1994)) and potatoes (Huang and Stumpf, <highlight><italic>Arch Biochem. Biophys. </italic></highlight>140: 158-173 (1970)), whereas the concentration of cellular acetate is estimated to be about 1.0 mM (Kuhn et al., <highlight><italic>Arch Biochem. Biophys. </italic></highlight>209: 441-450 (1981)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The pPDH appears to have the same general structure as mtPDH, being composed of a pyruvate dehydrogenase component (E1&agr; and E1&bgr;), a transacetylase component (E2), and dehydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3) subunits. The molecular weight of pPDH and its cofactor requirements are also similar to mtPDH, although affinities for NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and TPP vary somewhat (Camp and Randall, <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>77: 571-577 (1985); Miemyk et al. (1983), supra; and Conner et al., <highlight><italic>Planta </italic></highlight>200: 195-202 (1996)). pPDH, which is less sensitive to acetyl CoA than mtPDH, has an optimal pH of about 8.0 and requires about 10 mM Mg<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> for maximal activity. While the activity of mtPDH is controlled by a sophisticated kinase/phosphatase system, which phosphorylates and thereby inactivates the E1&agr; subunit, pPDH is not subject to such regulation. However, pPDH is strongly regulated by the NADH/NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> ratio and is moderately regulated by light. Regulation by ATP, NADPH, fatty acyl CoAs and glycolytic intermediates is minor (Camp et al., <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>933: 269-275 (1988); and Qi et al., <highlight><italic>J. Exp. Bot. </italic></highlight>47: 1889-1896 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> PDH activity varies from one tissue to the next with mtPDH activity varying 15-fold and pPDH activity varying 6-fold (Lernmark and Gardestrom, Plant Physiol. 106: 1633-1638 (1994)). The ratio of pPDH/mtPDH also varies between plants, with 6.5 times more activity in the chloroplasts than in the mitochondria of wheat leaves to 6.7 times more activity in the mitochondria than in the chloroplasts of peas. Although chloroplasts have proportionally less PDH activity than mitochondria in pea as compared to wheat, the chloroplasts have nearly as much PDH as mitochondria in absolute terms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> ACL is an enzyme that is responsible for the generation of acetyl CoA. ACL generates acetyl CoA as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>citrate&plus;ATP&plus;CoASH&rarr;acetyl-CoA&plus;oxaloacetate&plus;ADP&plus;P<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> wherein ADP represents adenosine diphosphate and P<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>represents orthophosphate and wherein the citrate is that which is generated in the TCA cycle in the mitochondrion. The activity of ACL has been found to correlate with lipid accumulation in developing seeds of <highlight><italic>Brassica napus </italic></highlight>L. (Ratledge et al., <highlight><italic>Lipids </italic></highlight>32(1): 7-12 (1997)) and in the supernatant of a developing soybean (Glycine max L. Merr., var. Harosoy 63) cotyledon homogenate Nelson et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>55: 69-72 (1975)). ACL also has been found in crude extracts from the endosperm tissue of germinating castor bean (<highlight><italic>Ricinus communis </italic></highlight>cv. Hale) and has been found to be maximally active in 4-5-day old seedlings (Fritsch et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>63: 687-691 (1979)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> PDC is a cytosolic enzyme that is responsible for the generation of acetaldehyde from pyruvate. PDC generates acetaldehyde from pyruvate as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>pyruvate&rarr;acetaldehyde&plus;CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The acetaldehyde so produced can be acted upon by ALDH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> ALDH is responsible for the generation of acetate from acetaldehyde. ALDH generates acetate from acetaldehyde as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>acetaldehyde&plus;NAD<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&plus;H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O&rarr;acetate&plus;NADH<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&plus;H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The acetate so produced can then enter the plastids, where it can be converted to acetyl CoA through the action of ACS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> ACH is an enzyme that is known to exist in yeast and is believed to exist in the mitochondria of plants. ACH is believed to generate acetate from acetyl CoA pools present in the mitochondria. The acetate so produced is then believed to be released from the mitochondrion into the cytosol. The cytosolic acetate can then enter the plastids, wherein it can be converted to acetyl CoA through the action of ACS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Acetyl CoA is the common precursor of a large number of phytochemicals, which have widely varied biological functions and which represent renewable, energy-rich products of agriculture (e.g., fats, oils, waxes, isoprenoids and bioplastics (e.g., polyhydroxybutyrate) or which affect agricultural production (e.g., flavonoids, stilbenoids, isoprenoids and malonyl derivatives) (Goodwin and Mercer, <highlight><italic>Introduction to Plant Biochemistry, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>ed., Pergamon Press, New York (1988)). These phytochemicals are synthesized either by the carboxylation or sequential condensation of acetyl CoA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Carboxylation of acetyl CoA (via the intermediate malonyl CoA) leads to the biosynthesis of fatty acids (e.g., membranes, oils, cuticle, suberin and cutin), flavonoids (e.g., pigments, phytoalexins and plant protection), stilbenoids (e.g., plant protection and pharmaceuticals), acridones, malonic acid, and a variety of malonyl derivatives (aminocyclopropane carboxylic acids, D-amino acids, flavonoids and pesticides). Fatty acids are the building blocks of all cellular membranes. In addition, fatty acids are utilized in developmentally regulated processes in the biogenesis of seed oils, cuticle, cutin and suberin. Most seed oils are triacylglycerols. Flavonoids are a group of water-soluble phenolic compounds that have a wide range of biological activities as pigments and they accumulate in responses of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses (e.g., drought, fungal and bacterial pathogens, and salt stress). Stilbenoids are thought to play a role in plant defense mechanisms. The acridones are a class of alkaloids that have a wide spectrum of antimicrobial, antimolluscosidal and antiviral activities. Numerous malonyl derivatives exist in plants, including those of D-amino acids, flavonoids and xenobiotics, such as pesticides. The malonation of aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid, which is the precursor of ethylene, may influence the generation of the hormone ethylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The condensation of acetyl CoA (via the intermediates acetoacetyl CoA and HMG CoA) leads to the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. Examples of isoprenoids include sterols, phytoalexins, abscisic acid, gibberellins, phytoene, &bgr;-carotene, phytol, natural rubber, plant protection and pharmaceuticals. Isoprenoids are also significant constituents of many essential oils and fragrances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In addition, and of great excitement to the biotechnology industry, acetoacetyl CoA is the precursor for the production of a potentially new agricultural product from transgenic plants, namely polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB, a type of bioplastic). Research to date indicates that the production of transgenic bioplastics may be limited by the supply of acetyl CoA (Nawrath et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>91: 12760-12764 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The pathways that utilize acetyl CoA as a precursor are spatially and temporally compartmentalized. Fatty acids and sterols are synthesized by all cells for membrane biogenesis. The accumulation of most of the other acetyl CoA-derived phytochemicals is highly cell-specific and occurs in specific subcellular compartments at particular stages of development or in response to particular environmental signals. For example, acetyl CoA is required in plastids for de novo fatty acid synthesis, which produces 18-carbon fatty acids. The elongation of 18-carbon fatty acids to fatty acids of 20 carbons and longer requires a cytosolic acetyl CoA pool. Acetyl CoA is also required in the cytosol for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, flavonoids, and several, if not all, of the malonated derivatives. In addition, fatty acid synthesis in the plastid should be maximal during triacylglycerol deposition in oil seed as well as during times of maximum membrane formation, such as during the conversion of proplastids to chloroplasts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in view of the above, there remains a need for materials and methods to alter the level of enzymes involved in acetyl CoA production and, consequently, acetyl CoA levels in plants. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide such materials and methods. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention, as well as additional inventive features, will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from the following description. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the present invention provides isolated or purified nucleic acid molecules. By &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; is meant the removal of a nucleic acid from its natural environment. By &ldquo;purified&rdquo; is meant that a given nucleic acid, whether one that has been removed from nature (including genomic DNA and mRNA) or synthesized (including cDNA) and/or amplified under laboratory conditions, has been increased in purity, wherein &ldquo;purity&rdquo; is a relative term, not &ldquo;absolute purity.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nucleic acid molecules&rdquo; is intended to encompass a polymer of DNA or RNA, i.e., a polynucleotide, which can be single-stranded or double-stranded and which can contain non-natural or altered nucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> One isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encodes a plant ACS, such as that which is isolated from Arabidopsis, and a continuous fragment thereof comprising at least about 20 nucleotides.

Also provided is an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding a modified ACS, which comprises one or more insertions, deletions and/or substitutions, and a continuous fragment thereof comprising at least about 20 nucleotides. Desirably, the modified ACS does not differ functionally from the corresponding unmodified ACS, such as that comprising SEQ ID NO: 2. Preferably, the modified ACS converts acetate to acetyl-CoA at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75%, and most preferably at least about 90% as well as the corresponding unmodified ACS, such as that comprising SEQ ID NO: 2, as determined by in vitro assay using labeled acetate.

Also provided is an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding a modified E1&bgr; subunit of pPDH, which comprises one or more insertions, deletions and/or substitutions, and a continuous fragment thereof comprising at least about 20 nucleotides. Desirably, the modified E1&bgr; pPDH subunit does not differ functionally from the corresponding unmodified E1&bgr; pPDH subunit, such as that comprising SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 14. Preferably, the modified E1&bgr; subunit of a plant pPDH, together with the remaining unmodified subunits of pPDH, does not differ functionally from a corresponding unmodified pPDH.

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The E1&bgr; subunit of pPDH is encoded by at least two genes in Arabidopsis designated E1&bgr;-1 and E1&bgr;-2, which are about 95% identical at the amino acid level. The cDNA encoding the E1&bgr;-1 subunit of pPDH from Arabidopsis encodes a 44 kDa protein. The E1&bgr;-1 subunit of pPDH of Arabidopsis is 78% similar and 70% identical to the pPDH of <highlight><italic>Porphyra purpurea </italic></highlight>and 52% similar and 41% identical to the E1&bgr; subunit of mtPDH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Also in this regard, the present invention further provides an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding the E3 subunit of a plant pPDH (E3 pPDH), such as that which is isolated from Arabidopsis, and a continuous fragment thereof comprising at least about 20 nucleotides.

Also provided is an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding a modified E3 subunit of pPDH, which comprises one or more insertions, deletions and/or substitutions, and a continuous fragment thereof comprising at least about 20 nucleotides. Desirably, the modified E3 pPDH subunit does not differ functionally from the corresponding unmodified E3 pPDH subunit, such as that comprising SEQ ID NO: 28 or SEQ ID NO: 30. Preferably, the modified E3 subunit of a plant pPDH, together with the remaining unmodified subunits, does not differ functionally from a corresponding unmodified pPDH. Preferably, the modified pPDH converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75%, most preferably at least about 90% as well as the corresponding unmodified pPDH, such as that comprising the E3 subunit comprising SEQ ID NO: 28 or SEQ ID NO: 30, as determined by in vitro assay using labeled pyruvate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Yet another isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encodes the A subunit of a plant ACL (ACL-A), such as that which is isolated from Arabidopsis, and a continuous fragment thereof comprising at least about 20 nucleotides. Preferably, the ACL-A-encoding nucleic acid molecule is (i) DNA and comprises SEQ ID NO: 7 or a sequence that encodes SEQ ID NO: 8, (ii) RNA and comprises a sequence encoded by SEQ ID NO: 7 or a sequence that encodes SEQ ID NO: 8, or (iii) a nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes to either one of the foregoing under stringent conditions.

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In this regard, the present invention further provides an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding the B subunit of a plant ACL (ACL-B), such as that which is isolated from Arabidopsis, and a continuous fragment thereof comprising at least about 20 nucleotides. Preferably, the ACL-B-encoding nucleic acid molecule is (i) DNA and comprises SEQ ID NO: 9 (ACL-B1) or SEQ ID NO: 11 (ACL-B2) or a sequence that encodes SEQ ID NO: 10 or SEQ ID NO: 12, (ii) RNA and comprises a sequence encoded by SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 11 or a sequence that encodes SEQ ID NO: 10 or SEQ ID NO: 12, or (iii) a nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes to either one of the foregoing under stringent conditions.

Desirably, the modified ACL-B subunit does not differ functionally from the corresponding unmodified ACL-B subunit, such as that comprising SEQ ID NO: 10 or SEQ ID NO: 12.

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> ACL is encoded by a small gene family in Arabidopsis. The cDNA encoding ACL-A from Arabidopsis encodes a 45 kDa protein, whereas the cDNA encoding ACL-B from Arabidopsis encodes a 70 kDa protein. ACL-A is encoded by at least two genes in Arabidopsis which are designated ACL-A1 and ACL-A2. ACL-B is encoded by at least two genes in Arabidopsis which are designated ACL-B 1 and ACL-B2. The ACL of Arabidopsis is 50% similar to that of the human and the rat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> An isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 15 or SEQ ID NO: 17 or encoding the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 16 or SEQ ID NO: 18 is also provided by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Likewise, an isolated and purified nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 21 or encoding the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 22 or a continuous fragment of either of the foregoing comprising at least about 20 nucleotides or a nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes to any of the foregoing under stringent conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Yet another isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule provided by the present invention is that which encodes a plant ACH. Such a nucleic acid molecule, including a continuous fragment thereof of at least about 20 nucleotides in length, can be isolated from a plant in accordance with Example 9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> With respect to the above, one of ordinary skill in the art knows how to generate insertions, deletions and/or substitutions in a given nucleic acid molecule. Also with respect to the above, &ldquo;does not differ functionally from&rdquo; is intended to mean that the modified enzyme has enzymatic activity characteristic of the unmodified enzyme. In other words, it acts upon the same substrate and generates the same product. The modified enzyme, however, can be more or less active than the unmodified enzyme as desired in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid molecules encoding ACS, pPDH and ACL can be isolated from any plant source. Suitable plant sources include, but are not limited to, Arabidopsis, soybean alfalfa, corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, rice, oats, rye, soybean, rapeseed, canola, cotton, safflower, peanut, palm, sorghum, sunflower, beet, various vegetable and fruit crops, such as cucumber, tomato, peppers, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> With respect to the above isolated or purified nucleic acid molecules, it is preferred that the one or more substitution(s) do(es) not result in a change in an amino acid of the enzyme. Alternatively, and also preferred, is that the one or more substitution(s) result(s) in the substitution of an amino acid with another amino acid of approximately equivalent size, shape and charge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Also with respect to the above isolated or purified nucleic acid molecules, a &ldquo;continuous fragment of at least about 20 nucleotides of the isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule, wherein the fragment is identifiable as derived from&rdquo; a given nucleic acid molecule is a continuous fragment that, for example, encodes an amino acid molecule that can carry out the same function as the corresponding complete amino acid molecule. For example, a fragment of an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding a plant ACS can be a continuous fragment of the ACS-encoding nucleic acid molecule that encodes an amino acid molecule that can convert acetate to acetyl-CoA in the presence of ATP and CoASH, but not necessarily as well as the corresponding complete amino acid molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The above isolated or purified nucleic acid molecules also can be characterized in terms of &ldquo;percentage of sequence identity.&rdquo; In this regard, a given nucleic acid molecule as described above can be compared to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a corresponding gene (i.e., the reference sequence) by optimally aligning the nucleic acid sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence, which does not comprise additions or deletions, for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage of sequence identity is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base occurs in both sequences, i.e., the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by computerized implementations of known algorithms (e.g., GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis., or BlastN and BlastX available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, Md.), or by inspection. Sequences are typically compared using BESTFIT or BlastN with default parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Substantial sequence identity&rdquo; means that at least 75%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95% of the sequence of a given nucleic acid molecule is identical to a given reference sequence. Typically, two polypeptides are considered to be substantially identical if at least 40%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95% of the amino acids of which the polypeptides are comprised are identical to or represent conservative substitutions of the amino acids of a given reference sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Another indication that polynucleotide sequences are substantially identical is if two molecules selectively hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. The phrase &ldquo;selectively hybridizing to&rdquo; refers to the selective binding of a single-stranded nucleic acid probe to a single-stranded target DNA or RNA sequence of complementary sequence when the target sequence is present in a preparation of heterogeneous DNA and/or RNA. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 20&deg; C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of the target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, &ldquo;stringent conditions&rdquo; preferably allow for from about 25% to about 5% mismatch, more preferably from about 15% to about 5% mismatch, and most preferably from about 10% to about 5% mismatch. &ldquo;At least moderately stringent conditions&rdquo; preferably allow for from about 40% to about 15% mismatch, more preferably from about 30% to about 15% mismatch, and most preferably from about 20% to about 15% mismatch. &ldquo;Low stringency conditions&rdquo; preferably allow for from about 60% to about 35% mismatch, more preferably from about 50% to about 35% mismatch, and most preferably from about 40% to about 35% mismatch. With respect to the preceding ranges of mismatch, 1% mismatch corresponds to one degree decrease in the melting temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, however, that two polynucleotide sequences can be substantially different at the nucleic acid level, yet encode substantially similar, if not identical, amino acid sequences, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. The present invention is intended to encompass such polynucleotide sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The above-described nucleic acid molecules, as well as the additional nucleic acid molecules described below with respect to the present inventive method, can be used, in whole or in part (i.e., as fragments), to identify and isolate corresponding genes from other plants as well as nonplants (e.g., yeast and bacterium) for use in the context of the present inventive method using conventional means as known in the art. For example, such molecules or fragments thereof can be used in chromosome walking, genomic subtraction, which requires the availability of strains having deletions of the target gene (Strauss and Ausubel, <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>87: 1889-1893 (1990); and Sun et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>4: 119-128 (1992)), transposon (Chuck et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>5: 371-378 (1993); Dean et al., <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>2: 69-81 (1992); Grevelding et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>899: 6085-6089 (1992); Swinbume et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>4: 583-595 (1992); Fedoroff and Smith, <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>3: 273-289 (1993); and Tsay et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>260: 342-344 (1993)) and T-DNA tagging (Feldmann, <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>1: 71-82 (1991); Feldmann et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>243: 1351-1354 (1989); Herman et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>11: 1051-1055 (1989); Konz et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>9: 1337-1346 (1989); and Kieber et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>72: 427-441 (1993)), and heterologous probe selection techniques in accordance with methods well-known in the art. Although T-DNA tagging, chromosome walking or heterologous probe selection can identify a DNA fragment that putatively contains the gene of interest, the DNA fragment must be confirmed by genetic complementation or some other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the present invention also provides a vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule as described above. A nucleic acid molecule as described above can be cloned into any suitable vector and can be used to transform or transfect any suitable host. The selection of vectors and methods to construct them are commonly known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and are described in general technical references (see, in general, &ldquo;Recombinant DNA Part D,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology</italic></highlight>, Vol. 153, Wu and Grossman, eds., Academic Press (1987)). Desirably, the vector comprises regulatory sequences, such as transcription and translation initiation and termination codons, which are specific to the type of host (e.g., bacterium, fungus, plant or animal) into which the vector is to be introduced, as appropriate and taking into consideration whether the vector is DNA or RNA. Preferably, the vector comprises regulatory sequences that are specific to the genus of the host. Most preferably, the vector comprises regulatory sequences that are specific to the species of the host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Constructs of vectors, which are circular or linear, can be prepared to contain an entire nucleic acid sequence as described above or a portion thereof ligated to a replication system functional in a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. Replication systems can be derived from ColE1, 2 m&mgr; plasmid, &lgr;, SV40, bovine papilloma virus, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In addition to the replication system and the inserted nucleic acid, the construct can include one or more marker genes, which allow for selection of transformed or transfected hosts. Marker genes include biocide resistance, e.g., resistance to antibiotics, heavy metals, etc., complementation in an auxotrophic host to provide prototrophy, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Suitable vectors include those designed for propagation and expansion or for expression or both. A preferred cloning vector is selected from the group consisting of the pUC series the pBluescript series (Stratagene, LaJolla, Calif.), the pET series (Novagen, Madison, Wis.), the pGEX series (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), and the pEX series (Clonetech, Palo Alto, Calif.). Bacteriophage vectors, such as &lgr;GT10, &lgr;GT11, &lgr;ZapII (Stratagene), &lgr;EMBL4, and &lgr;NM1149, also can be used. Examples of plant expression vectors include pBI101, pBI101.2, pBI101.3, pBI121 and pBIN19 (Clonetech, Palo Alto, Calif.). Examples of animal expression vectors include pEUK-C1, pMAM and pMAMneo (Clonetech). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A plant expression vector can comprise a native or normative promoter operably linked to a nucleic acid molecule encoding ACS, pPDH or ACL as described above. The selection of promoters, e.g., strong, weak, inducible, tissue-specific and developmental-specific, is within the skill in the art. Similarly, the combining of a nucleic acid molecule as described above with a promoter is also within the skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The expression vector optionally further comprises a transit peptide sequence between the promoter and coding sequence. For those genes that are normally expressed in the mitochondrion or plastid, it is preferred that the expression vector comprise a mitochondrial or plastidic transit peptide, respectively. Numerous plant gene products are known to contain transit peptide sequences. For example, the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, ferredoxin, chlorophyll a/b binding protein, and the like, comprise transit peptide sequences. Such transit peptide sequences can be isolated/synthesized and used in expression vectors in accordance with the present invention. Regardless of the source of the DNA fragment coding for the transit peptide, it should include a translation initiation codon and an amino acid sequence recognized by and functional in the organelle of the host plant cell or plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The present invention not only provides a vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule as described above but also provides a vector comprising or encoding an antisense sequence that hybridizes to or a ribozyme that cleaves an RNA molecule encoding a plant plastidic acetyl CoA synthetase, the E1&agr; subunit of a plant plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase, the E1&bgr; subunit of a plant plastidic dehydrogenase, the E2 subunit of a plant plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase, the E3 subunit of a plant plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase, the A subunit of a plant ATP-citrate lyase, the B subunit of a plant ATP-citrate lyase, a plant pyruvate decarboxylase, a plant acetyl CoA hydrolase, a plant mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase, and a plant aldehyde dehydrogenase. The present invention also provides the antisense molecules, which preferably are at least about 20 nucleotides in length, and the ribozymes, which preferably comprise at least about 20 continuous nucleotides complementary to the target sequence on each side of the active site of the ribozyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, the present invention provides a host cell comprising a vector as described above. In addition, the present invention provides a polypeptide produced by a host cell comprising a vector as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Suitable hosts include <highlight><italic>E. coli, B. subtilis, P. aerugenosa, S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><italic>N. crassa. E. coli</italic></highlight>, in particular <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>TB-1, TG-2, DH5&agr;, XL-BlueMRF&prime; (Stratagene), SA2821 and Y1090 are preferred hosts. A more preferred host is XL-Blue MRF&prime; or TGO2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above, the present invention provides polyclonal antibodies to ACS, pPDH E1&agr; and E1&bgr;, and ACL A and B. Such polyclonal antibodies can be produced in accordance with the methods of Examples 2, 4 and 6 or other methods known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of altering the level of an enzyme in a plant cell, a plant tissue, a plant organ or a plant. The method comprises contacting the plant cell, plant tissue, plant organ or plant with a vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule selected from the group consisting of (i) a gene encoding an enzyme or, if the enzyme is comprised of subunits, a subunit of an enzyme selected from the group consisting of plastidic acetyl CoA synthetase, plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase, ATP-citrate lyase, pyruvate decarboxylase, acetyl CoA hydrolase, mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, (ii) a nucleic acid molecule comprising or encoding an antisense molecule to an RNA molecule transcribed from a gene of (i), and (iii) a nucleic acid molecule comprising a ribozyme to an RNA molecule transcribed from a gene of (i). The vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule of (i) increases the level of an enzyme in the plant cell, plant tissue, plant organ or plant, whereas the vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule of (ii) or (iii) decreases the level of an enzyme in the plant cell, plant tissue, plant organ or plant. Preferably, the alteration of the enzyme results in an alteration of the level of acetyl CoA in the plant cell, plant tissue, plant organ or plant. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a plant cell, a plant tissue, a plant organ and a plant in which the level of acetyl CoA has been altered in accordance with the method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the nucleic acid molecule used in the present inventive method is one of those described above or one of those described below. In this regard, nucleic acid molecules that correspond to the above-described plant nucleic acid molecules but which have been isolated from animal, bacterial or yeast sources can be used in the context of the present inventive method to increase the level of an enzyme in a plant cell, a plant tissue, a plant organ or a plant, provided that a cDNA sequence is used in those instances where the animal, bacterial or yeast genomic sequence contains introns that may not be properly processed in a plant. In addition, it may be necessary to alter the cDNA sequence so that it contains codon sequences that are preferred in plant species over animal, bacterial or yeast species. However, to the extent that antisense or ribozyme sequences are employed in the present inventive method, it would be advantageous to use a nucleic acid molecule isolated from a plant that is of the same origin as the plant cell, plant tissue, plant organ or plant in which the level of an enzyme is to be altered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> An isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding PDC for use in the present inventive method can be obtained in accordance with methods known in the art. A cDNA clone encoding PDC1 from maize is available from GenBank as accession number X177555 (genomic DNA X 59546). Partial clones Z21721 and L11312 for PDC-22 and partial clones Z21722 and L11313 for PDC-3 from maize are also available from GenBank. cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences for PDC-1 and PDC-2 from Arabidopsis are provided herein as SEQ ID NOS: 15-18 as set forth in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B. Alternatively, an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding a PDC that has been modified by one or more insertions, deletions and/or substitutions, wherein the encoded PDC does not differ functionally from the unmodified PDC, can be used. Preferably, the modified PDC converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde preferably at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75%, most preferably at least about 90% as well as the unmodified PDC as determined by in vitro assay using labeled pyruvate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> An isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding the E2 subunit of pPDH for use in the present inventive method can be obtained in accordance with methods known in the art. A cDNA clone encoding E2 pPDH is available from Mooney et al., Biochemistry Department, University of Missouri (Mooney et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>120: 443-451(1999)). Alternatively, an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding the E2 subunit of pPDH that has been modified by one or more insertions, deletions and/or substitutions, wherein the encoded E2 subunit of pPDH does not differ functionally from the unmodified E2 subunit of pPDH, can be used. Preferably, a pPDH comprising a modified E2 subunit of pPDH converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA preferably at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75%, most preferably at least about 90% as well as a pPDH comprising an unmodified E2 subunit as determined by in vitro assay in the presence of labeled pyruvate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> An isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding ACH can be isolated from a plant for use in the present inventive method using the ACH gene from <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cervisiae </italic></highlight>(GenBank Accession No. M31036; Lee et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>265: 7413-7418 (1990)). For example, existing <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>mutants (Lee et al., <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>1297(1): 105-109 (1996); and Minet et al., <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>2: 417-422 (1992)) can be complemented with a library expressing Arabidopsis cDNAs in a plasmid that can replicate and express those genes in yeast (see, for example, Wang et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Molec. Biol. </italic></highlight>31: 1093-1104 (1996)). A clone that can complement the yeast mutant and restore wild-type growth capability is selected. Alternatively, a clone can be obtained by purifying the ACH to homogeneity and obtaining partial N-terminal sequence analysis. This sequence analysis is then reverse translated into a DNA sequence. The DNA sequence is then used to screen a cDNA library from Arabidopsis to find the clone containing the cDNA for ACH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> An isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding mtPDH for use in the present inventive method can be obtained in accordance with methods known in the art. The mtPDH comprises four subunits. A cDNA clone encoding the E1&agr; subunit of mtPDH from Arabidopsis is described in Luethy et al., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>164(2): 251-254 (1995). The cDNA clone comprises 1435 bp in which there is a 1167 bp open reading frame encoding a 43.0 kD polypeptide of 389 amino acids (pI 7.1). The E1&agr; subunit from Arabidopsis is 47-51% identical at the amino acid level to other eukaryotic sequences. A cDNA clone encoding the E1&bgr; subunit of mtPDH from Arabidopsis is described in Luethy et al., <highlight><italic>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </italic></highlight>1187(1): 95-98 (1994). The cDNA clone comprises 1320 bp in which there is a 1089 bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 363 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 39,190 Da and an isoelectric point of 4.9. A 29 amino acid presumptive mitochondrial targeting sequence is present at the amino terminus. A cDNA clone encoding the E2 subunit (dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase) of mtPDH from Arabidopsis is described in Guan et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>270(10): 5412-5417 (1995). The cDNA clone comprises 2.2 kb. Such sequences can be used in the present inventive method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding an E1&agr;, E1&bgr; or E2 subunit of mtPDH that differs from the E1&agr;, or E1&bgr; subunits of the mtPDH of Luethy et al. or the E2 subunit of the mtPDH of Guan et al., respectively, by one or more insertions, deletions and/or substitutions, wherein the modified E1&agr;, E1&bgr; or E2 subunit, together with the other unmodified subunits of mtPDH of Leuthy et al. or Guan et al., does not differ functionally from an unmodified mtPDH. Preferably, the modified subunit, together with the other unmodified subunits, converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA at least about 70%, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 85%, most preferably at least about 90% as well as the unmodified mtPDH comprising the subunits disclosed by Leuthy et al. and Guan et al. as determined by in vitro assay in the presence of labeled pyruvate can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> An isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding ALDH for use in the present inventive method can be obtained in accordance with the methods set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,242 (the &apos;242 patent). The &apos;242 patent discloses the nucleic acid sequence of ALDH as SEQ ID NO: 1 and the corresponding amino acid sequence as SEQ ID NO: 2. cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences for ALDH-1, ALDH-2, ALDH-3 and ALDH-4 from Arabidopsis are provided herein as SEQ ID NOS: 19-26 in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, an isolated or purified nucleic acid molecule encoding ALDH that differs from the ALDH of the &apos;242 patent or the Arabidopsis ALDH sequences as set forth herein by one or more insertions, deletions and/or substitutions, wherein the encoded ALDH does not differ functionally from the preceding ALDH, can be used. Preferably, the modified ALDH converts acetaldehyde to acetate preferably at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75%, most preferably at least about 90% as well as the unmodified ALDH as determined by in vitro assay in the presence of labeled acetaldehyde. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Preferred vectors for use in the present inventive method are characterized as described above. Like vectors, which comprise a nucleic acid encoding PDC, E2 pPDH, ACH, ALDH or mtPDH as described above, also are preferred. Such vectors can be introduced into a plant by any suitable means. For example, cells in tissue culture can be transformed with a vector. This method is particularly useful for plants like maize, for example. Arabidopsis, on the other hand, preferably is transformed using the Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration method (see, e.g., Chang et al., Plant J. 5(4): 551-558 (1994); Katavic et al., <highlight><italic>Molec. Gen. Genet. </italic></highlight>245(3): 363-370 (1994); and http://www.bio.net:80/hypermail/ARABIDOPSIS/9707/0015.html)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> If it is desired to increase the expression of a given gene, it is preferred to do so by introducing a gene encoding an enzyme or, if the enzyme is comprised of subunits, a subunit of an enzyme selected from the group consisting of plastidic acetyl CoA synthetase, plastidic pyruvate dehydrogenase, ATP-citrate lyase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase and acetyl CoA hydrolase. The gene is preferably introduced by way of a vector. It is preferred that either multiple extra copies of the gene are introduced into the plant cell, plant tissue, plant organ or plant or that a vector comprising a strong promoter, such as the CaMV 35S promoter, is introduced into the plant cell, plant tissue, plant organ or plant such that the gene is expressed at a higher rate, thereby generating more mRNA, which, in turn, is translated into more of the encoded enzyme. Desirably, expression of an enzyme comprising subunits is increased by increasing the expression of all subunits. Expression of an enzyme comprising subunits can be decreased by decreasing the expression of a single subunit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In this regard, if expression is desired in a given tissue, a tissue-specific promoter can be used in the vector. Examples of tissue-specific promoters and enhancers include those described in Guerineau, <highlight><italic>Methods Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>49: 1-32 (1995); Meisel et al., <highlight><italic>Gent. Eng. </italic></highlight>19: 183-199 (1997); and Edwards et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Genet. </italic></highlight>24: 275-303 (1990)). Similarly, an organ-specific promoter can be used in the vector. Developmentally specific promoters and inducible promoters also can be used, such as those described in Gruner et al., <highlight><italic>Eur. J. Biochem. </italic></highlight>220(1): 247-255 (1994); Caddick et al, <highlight><italic>Nat. Biotech. </italic></highlight>16(2): 177-180 (1998); Moore et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>95(1): 376-381 (1998); and Mett et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>90(10): 4567-4571 (1993). Malate synthase and isocitrate lyase plant promoters are examples of developmentally specific promoters. Napin, phaseolin, oleosin, glycinin, cruciferin and betaconglycinin are examples of seed storage protein promoters. Inducible promoters, which can be used in those instances where the expression of a given gene is desired after a host plant has reached maturity, include temperature sensitive regulatory elements, heat shock promoters, stress response promoters, and chemically inducible promoters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> If it is desired to decrease the expression of a given gene, it is preferred to do so by introducing either a nucleic acid molecule comprising (i.e., in the case of an RNA vector) or encoding (i.e., in the case of a DNA vector) an antisense nucleic acid molecule to an RNA molecule transcribed from an aforementioned gene or a nucleic acid molecule comprising a ribozyme to an RNA molecule transcribed from such a gene (see, for example, Senior, <highlight><italic>Biotech. Genet. Eng. Rev. </italic></highlight>15: 79-119 (1998); Bird et al., <highlight><italic>Biotech. Genet. Eng. Rev. </italic></highlight>9: 207-227(1991); Matzke et al., <highlight><italic>Trends Genet. </italic></highlight>11(1): 1-3 (1995); Baulcombe, <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>32(1-2): 79-88 (1996); Castanatto et al., <highlight><italic>Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Exp. </italic></highlight>2(4): 331-357 (1992); and Rossi, <highlight><italic>Trends Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>13(8): 301-306 (1995)). In antisense technology, a nucleic acid segment from the desired plant gene can be cloned and operably linked to the promoter sequence such that the anti-sense strand of RNA is transcribed. For example, the 35S promoter from CaMV can be fused to a cDNA encoding a given enzyme but in opposite orientation from normal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid sequence introduced in antisense suppression generally is substantially identical to at least a portion, preferably at least about 20 continuous nucleotides, of the endogenous gene or gene to be repressed, but need not be identical. The vectors can, thus, be designed such that the inhibitory effect applies to other proteins within a family of genes exhibiting homology or substantial homology to the target gene. The introduced sequence also need not be full-length relative to either the primary transcription product or fully processed mRNA. Generally, higher homology can be used to compensate for the use of a shorter sequence. Furthermore, the introduced sequence need not have the same intron or exon pattern, and homology of non-coding segments will be equally effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The plant cell, plant tissue, plant organ or plant is then contacted with the construct and the anti-sense strand of RNA is produced. In plant cells, it has been shown that anti-sense RNA inhibits gene expression (see, e.g., Sheehy et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>85: 8805-8809 (1988); and Hiatt et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,801,340). The resulting recombinant gene can be transformed into Arabidopsis plants, for example, using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Inhibition of expression of a given gene can be confirmed in a transformed plant cell by standard methods for measuring the presence and/or activity of a given enzyme. In this regard, it is important to point out that some plants, such as Arabidopsis, contain two genes, i.e., &ldquo;paralogs,&rdquo; encoding a given enzyme, such as ACL, PDC and ALDH. In such instances, it is desirable to decrease the expression of a given gene with antisense RNA because the paralogous genes generate mRNAs that are nearly identical in sequence (as is the case of ACL, PDC and ALDH mRNAs) and, therefore, a single antisense RNA molecule can reduce and even block the expression of both paralogs, depending on the antisense molecule utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Ribozymes also have been reported to have use as a means to inhibit expression of endogenous plant genes. It is possible to design ribozymes that specifically pair with virtually any target RNA and cleave the phosphodiester backbone at a specific location, thereby functionally inactivating the target RNA. In carrying out this cleavage, the ribozyme is not itself altered and is, thus, capable of recycling and cleaving other molecules, making it a true enzyme. The inclusion of ribozyme sequences within antisense RNAs confers RNA-cleaving activity upon them, thereby increasing the activity of the constructs. The design and use of target RNA-specific ribozymes is described in Haseloff et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>334: 585-591 (1988). Preferably, the ribozyme comprises at least about 20 continuous nucleotides complementary to the target sequence on each side of the active site of the ribozyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Techniques for contacting a plant cell, a plant tissue, a plant organ or a plant with a vector so that the vector is taken up by a plant cell, alone or as part of a plant tissue, a plant organ or a plant, and expressed therein are known in the art. Such methods involve plant tissue culture techniques, for example. Herein, &ldquo;contacting&rdquo; is intended to mean that the cell, tissue, organ or plant is brought into contact with the vector in such a manner that the vector enters the cell and is expressed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The plant cell, plant tissue, plant organ or plant can be contacted with the vector by any suitable means, including direct transformation, e.g., polyethylene glycol precipitation (Paszkowski et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>3: 2717-2722 (1984), cell bombardment, i.e., attaching the DNA to metallic pellets and blasting them through the plant&apos;s cell wall (Fromm et al., <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>8: 833-839 (1990); Gordon-Kamm et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>2: 603-618 (1990); and Klein et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>327: 70-73 (1987)). Exogenous DNA can be introduced into a dicotyledonous plant cell by insertion of the nucleic acid encoding a gene involved in acetyl CoA production into the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium and adding suitable ingredients to promote transformation thereby (Horsch et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>223: 496-498 (1984); Fraley et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>80: 4803 (1983); and DeBlock et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>3: 1681-1689 (1984)). Other techniques are available for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a plant and/or a subset of its constituent cells, including electroporation (Fromm et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>82: 5824 (1995), microinjection, protoplast-mediated gene transfer, and silicon carbide crystal-mediated gene transfer. These various techniques are discussed in Genetic Engineering News 14(4): at pages 1, 3 and 24, and are generally known in the art. See, for example, Weising et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Genet. </italic></highlight>22: 421-477 (1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Transformed plant cells, which are derived by any of the above transformation techniques can be cultured to regenerate a whole plant, which possesses the desired transformed phenotype. Plant regeneration from cultured protoplasts is described in Evans et al., <highlight><italic>Protoplast Isolation and Culture, Handbook of Plant Cell Culture</italic></highlight>, MacMillan Publishing Co., New York, pp. 124-176 (1983); and Binding, <highlight><italic>Regeneration of Plants, Plant Protoplasts</italic></highlight>, CRC Press, Boca Raton, pp. 21-73 (1985). Regeneration also can be obtained from plant callus, explants, organs or parts thereof. Such regeneration techniques are described generally in Klee et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. of Plant Phys. </italic></highlight>38: 467-486 (1987). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> One of ordinary skill will appreciate that, after an expression cassette is stably incorporated in transgenic plants and confirmed to be operable, it can be introduced into other plants by sexual crossing. Any of a number of standard breeding techniques can be used, depending upon the species to be crossed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Another method of decreasing acetyl CoA levels is co-supression. See, for example, Que et al., <highlight><italic>Dev. Genet. </italic></highlight>22(1): 100-109 (1998) and Smyth, <highlight><italic>Curr. Biol. </italic></highlight>7(12): R793-R795 (1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, reverse genetics systems, which are well-known in the art, can be used to generate and isolate down-regulated or null mutants. One such system, the Trait Utility System for Corn, i.e., TUSC, is based on successful systems from other organisms (Ballinger et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>86: 9402-9406 (1989); Kaiser et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS USA </italic></highlight>87: 1686-1690 (1990); and Rushforth et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell. Biol. </italic></highlight>13: 902-910 (1993)). The central feature of the system is to identify Mu transposon insertions within a DNA sequence of interest in anticipation that at least some of these insertion alleles will be mutants. To develop the system in corn, DNA was collected from a large population of Mutator transposon stocks that were then self-pollinated to produce F2 seed. To find Mu transposon insertions within a specified DNA sequence, the collection of DNA samples is screened via PCR using a gene-specific primer and a primer that anneals to the inverted repeats of Mu transposons. A PCR product is expected only when the template DNA comes from a plant that contains a Mu transposon insertion within the target gene. Once such a DNA sample is identified, F2 seed from the corresponding plant is screened for a transposon insertion allele. Transposon insertion mutations of the an1 gene have been obtained via the TUSC procedure (Bensen et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>7: 75-84 (1995)). This system is applicable to other plant species, at times modified as necessary in accordance with knowledge and skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> T-DNA insertional mutagenesis can be used to generate insertional mutations in one of the above-mentioned genes so as to affect adversely the expression of a given gene. Theoretically, about 100,000 independent T-DNA insertions are required for a 95% probability of getting an insertion in any given gene (McKinnet, Plant J. 8(4): 613-622 (1995); and Forsthoefel et al., <highlight><italic>Aust. J. Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>19: 353-366 (1992)). Currently, there are 12,000 such T-DNA-tagged lines that are publicly available (http://aims.cps.msu.edu/aims/). Additional T-DNA-tagged lines are being generated and are being made available. In this regard, Monsanto (St. Louis, Mo.) currently has a collection of T-DNA tagged lines, which are reported to contain 90,000-150,000 T-DNA insertions. T-DNA tagged lines of plants can be screened using PCR. For example, a primer can be designed for one end of the T-DNA and another primer can be designed for the gene of interest and both primers can be used in PCR. If no PCR product is obtained, then there is no insertion in the gene of interest. In contrast, if a PCR product is obtained, then there is an insertion in the gene of interest. Insertional mutations, however, often generate null alleles, which can be lethal. Alternatively, if there is more than one gene that encodes for a given enzyme, a mutation in one of the genes may not result in decreased expression of the enzyme encoded by the gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Another alternative method to decrease expression of a given gene is to use a compound that inhibits expression of one of the above-mentioned genes or that inhibits the activity of the enzyme encoded by one of the above-mentioned genes. For example, glucose is known to inhibit PDC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above, gene replacement technology can be used to increase or decrease expression of a given gene. Gene replacement technology is based upon homologous recombination (see, Schnable et al., <highlight><italic>Curr. Opinions Plant Biol. </italic></highlight>1: 123 (1998)). The nucleic acid of the enzyme of interest can be manipulated by mutagenesis (e.g., insertions, deletions, duplications or replacements) to either increase or decrease enzymatic function. The altered sequence can be introduced into the genome to replace the existing, e.g., wild-type, gene via homologous recombination (Puchta and Hohn, <highlight><italic>Trends Plant Sci. </italic></highlight>1: 340 (1996); Kempin et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>389: 802 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Also in addition to the above, organelle re-targeting can be used to increase or decrease expression of a given gene involved in acetyl CoA production. For example, one of the above-mentioned genes can be modified by removing its organelle-targeting sequence and replacing it with a novel organelle-targeting sequence (see, for example, Roesler et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>113(1): 75-81 (1997) in re retargeting of a cystolic enzyme to the plastids; Moloney et al., <highlight><italic>Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. </italic></highlight>14: 321336 (1997); deCastro Silva et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>30(4): 769-780 (1996); and Cline et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. </italic></highlight>12: 1-26 (1996)). The altered sequence can then be introduced into the plant genome via standard transformation procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The activity of a given enzyme can be measured by using labeled substrates in vitro. ACS activity can be assayed quickly and conveniently in vitro by incubating whole chloroplasts, chloroplast extracts or leaf extracts with labeled acetate, CoA, ATP and Mg and transferring aliquots of the reaction mixture to pieces of either Whatman No. 1 or DE81 filter paper as described by Roughan et al., <highlight><italic>Analyt. Biochem. </italic></highlight>216: 77-82 (1994). The paper pieces are then washed to remove unreacted acetate. Acetyl CoA, which binds quantitatively to the paper, is then determined by scintillation counting. If desired, ACS can be further purified as described by Zeiher et al., <highlight><italic>Plant. Physiol. </italic></highlight>96: 382-389 (1991) for use in in vitro assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Reducing pPDH in accordance with the above method is expected to result in a decrease in the pool of plastidic acetyl CoA, which, in turn, is expected to affect de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, i.e., synthesis of 18-carbon fatty acids. This would be most readily observable as a reduction in the accumulation of seed oils. Reducing cytosolic ACL is expected to result in a decrease in the pool of cytosolic acetyl CoA, which, in turn, is expected to affect the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids and flavonoids. This would be most readily observable as a reduction of seed coat color (due to reduced flavonoids), a reduction of cuticle deposition on the aerial portion of the plant, and a reduction in 20- and 22-carbon fatty acids in the seed oil (due to reduced elongation of 18-carbon fatty acids). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Reducing PDC, ALDH and/or ACS is expected to affect the acetyl CoA pool. The reduction of ALDH is known to affect pollen development in plants (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,242). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Whether or not a given acetyl CoA-generating pathway affects another acetyl CoA pathway can be determined by measuring the effect on expression of acetyl CoA-generating genes and by measuring the generation of acetyl CoA pools in vivo. For example, using a transgenic plant, it can be determined whether or not the reduction in a given acetyl CoA generating enzyme causes compensatory alterations in the expression of other genes. As microarray chip technology becomes established and available (DeRisi et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>278: 680-686 (1997)), the effect of a given genetic alteration on the expression of all cloned genes of Arabidopsis can be determined. Metabolic radiotracer studies can be performed to measure the generation of different acetyl CoA pools in vivo. In such studies, radioactively labeled precursors are provided to intact tissues and the radioactive label is monitored as the precursor is metabolized. By comparing wild-type plants and plants that have reduced activities of one of the acetyl CoA-generating enzymes, the source of different acetyl CoA pools can be determined as well as the effect of the reduction in a given acetyl CoA generating enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In addition to being useful in the study of acetyl CoA generation in plants, including the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of genes encoding enzymes required for acetyl CoA generation, the above-described method is useful in the generation of plants for the production of acetyl CoA-derived phytochemicals. The method is useful in the alteration of acetyl CoA levels in plants, including wild-type and mutant plants, such as alfalfa, corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, rice, oats, rye, soybean, rapeseed, canola, cotton, safflower, peanut, palm, sunflower, beet, and various vegetable and fruit crops, such as cucumber, tomato, peppers, and the like. By &ldquo;alteration&rdquo; is meant that the acetyl CoA level in a given plant (or plant cell, tissue or organ) is different as a result of the practice of the present inventive method as compared to a like plant, the acetyl CoA level of which has not been altered as a result of the practice of the present inventive method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In view of the above method, the present invention also provides a bacterium, a yeast, an animal, including a cell, tissue or organ thereof, or a plant, including a cell, tissue or organ thereof, in which the level of an enzyme has been altered in accordance with the above-described method. Preferably, the present inventive method is used to generate a plant cell, a plant tissue, a plant organ or a plant. The plant cell can be cultured and kept as plant tissue culture cells or certain plant hormones known in the art can be added to the culture medium, thereby causing the plant tissue culture cells to differentiate and thereby form a new plant variety. Such plant culturing methods useful in the performance of this aspect of the invention are well known in the art. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a plant cell, a plant tissue, a plant organ and a plant in which the level of an enzyme has been altered. Preferably, the alteration of the level of an enzyme results in an alteration of the level of acetyl CoA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The above method can be adapted for in vitro production of acetyl CoA, which, in turn, can be used to produce acetyl CoA phytochemicals. For example, the various enzymes required for acetyl CoA synthesis can be prepared from a suitable host and placed in a reaction vessel with suitable substrates, an energy source, cofactors and other ingredients known in the art so as to produce acetyl CoA. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> This example describes the cloning of ACS cDNA from Arabidopsis and the comparison of its sequence with ACS from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The deduced amino acid sequences of the ACS genes from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>S. cervisiae </italic></highlight>were used to search the dbEST database (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) using the program BLAST. One <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>cDNA clone was identified as a possible ACS gene. This clone, 220J9T7 (accession number N38599), was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Research Center (ABRC) at Ohio State University. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Plasmid DNA from this clone was prepared and sequenced by the Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility of Iowa State University. Analysis of the sequence data revealed that this clone (J9) encoded approximately 40% of the C-terminal portion of ACS. Repeated searches of the dbEST database failed to reveal any longer clonal sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> cRACE (Maruyama et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Research </italic></highlight>23: 3796-3797 (1995)) was used to isolate the rest of the ACS gene. mRNA from <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>was prepared from fresh plant tissue. Nesting ACS-specific primers, based on the 5&prime; end sequence of J9, were used in two sequential cDNA synthesis reactions to generate a specific single-stranded, antisense cDNA fragment encoding a fragment of ACS DNA 5&prime; to the known J9 sequence. Ligation and circularization of this single-stranded cDNA by RNA ligase was followed by two sequential PCR amplifications, using nesting primer pairs based on J9 sequence. This process yielded an approximately 320 bp fragment of DNA encoding a further portion of the ACS gene. This fragment was cloned into the vector pBS (Stratagene), named J9E1, and sequenced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The remainder of the ACS gene was obtained by PCR amplification of an <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>cDNA library constructed in the vector pSPORT (Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.). Two nesting antisense primers were designed and synthesized that hybridize to the 5&prime; terminus of J9E1. These primers were used in conjunction with two nesting sense vector primers specific to the vector pSPORT to amplify sequentially by PCR a further 270 bp fragment of ACS cDNA. This fragment was cloned in pBS, given the name J9E2, and sequenced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Likewise, two more nesting antisense primers were designed and synthesized that corresponded to the 5&prime; terminus of J9E2. Sequential PCR amplification of the cDNA library with these primers and the vector primers yielded a cDNA fragment encoding the rest of the ACS gene. This fragment was cloned in pBS, named J9E3, and sequenced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> All of the sequence data from clones J9, J9E1, J9E2 and J9E3 were aligned and condensed to give a single DNA sequence encoding the complete <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>ACS gene. This sequence was submitted to GenBank as accession no. AF036618. This DNA encodes a protein of 693 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 76,678 daltons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> MACAW alignment of the cDNA sequence of ACS from Arabidopsis with the protein sequence of ACS from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and the protein sequences of the two isoforms of ACS from <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>shows that the ACS from Arabidopsis is 53% identical to the ACS from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and 37% identical to the I isoform of ACS from <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>and 40% identical to the II isoform of ACS from <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> This example describes the production of a polyclonal antibody to ACS from Arabidopsis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> PCR primers were designed such that the coding region of clone J9 would be amplified by PCR as a DNA fragment terminated by restriction sites suitable for cloning into the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>protein expression vector pMALC-2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). The expression vector clone J9-NT1/pMALC-2 was constructed according to the instructions furnished by the supplier of the vector. This clone, when transformed into <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and induced with isopropylthio-&bgr;-galactoside (IPTG), caused the production of a recombinant chimeric fusion protein consisting of the C-terminal portion of <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>ACS filsed to the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>maltose binding protein (MBP). This recombinant protein was purified from one liter cultures of transformed <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and purified using the amylose column supplied by New England Biolabs, according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocols. The purified protein was assayed electrophoretically for purity, quantitated, and given to the Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility of Iowa State University for production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Pre-immune and immune sera from the rabbits were tested for specificity and titer by immunoblotting against the original antigen recombinant protein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> This example describes the cloning of cDNA for the E1&agr;, E1&bgr; and E3 subunits of pPDH and the comparison of the sequence of the cDNA encoding the E1&bgr; subunit with the sequence of pPDH from red algae and mtPDH from Arabidopsis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The dbEST database was searched with the deduced amino acid sequences of the E1&agr; and E1&bgr; subunits of PDH from <highlight><italic>Porphyra purpurea </italic></highlight>using the program BLAST. Clones identified as possible pPDHs were obtained from the ABRC at Ohio State University. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>EST clone 232D14T7 (N65567) and 232D13T7 (N65566) displayed a significant degree of homology to the E1&agr; subunit of PDH from <highlight><italic>Porphyra purpurea</italic></highlight>. Both clones contain identical nucleotide sequences encoding all but the first 50-70 amino acids of the E1&agr; subunit of pPDH, based on homology to other E1&agr; subunits of PDH. Clone 232D14T7 (D14) was chosen for sequencing. The DNA sequence of this clone comprises SEQ ID NO: 3 and the deduced amino acid sequence comprises SEQ ID NO: 4 (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and Sequence Listing). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>EST clones 163C12T7 (R2996; E1&bgr;-1) and 169K3T7 (R64987; E1&bgr;-1) displayed a significant degree of homology to the E1&bgr; subunit of PDH of <highlight><italic>Porphyra purpurea</italic></highlight>. These two clones are related to, but not identical to, the corresponding mtPDH of <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></highlight>. Clone 163C12T7 (C12) was chosen for sequencing. Clone C12 appears to encode almost all of the coding region of the E11 subunit of pPDH. The sequence of this clone comprises SEQ ID NO: 5 and the deduced amino acid sequence comprises SEQ ID NO: 6 (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and Sequence Listing). A second E1&bgr; subunit gene (E1&bgr;-2) was discovered in Arabidopsis by searching through the Arabidopsis genome sequence in Genbank. Careful analysis showed that the genomic sequence in the database was different from the cDNA sequence of E1&bgr;-1. Thus, all of the cDNA EST clones were requested from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Stock Center (Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio) and sequenced. The cDNA sequences of E1&bgr;-1 and E1&bgr;--2 are nearly identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Genes encoding the E3 subunit of pPDH from Arabidopsis were isolated as follows. The Arabidopsis EST database was searched using the E3 gene for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 (Engels et al., <highlight><italic>Microbiology </italic></highlight>143: 3543-3553 (1997)). Two partial cDNA clones were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Stock Center. The sequences were used as probes to screen a cDNA library. Near full-length clones were isolated. The genes were translated and transcribed in vitro and to verify that the genes were plastidic as opposed to mitochondrial. The translated proteins were imported into isolated chloroplasts and processed to mature form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> MACAW alignment of the cDNA sequence of E1&bgr; pPDH from Arabidopsis with the protein sequence of pPDH from red algae and the protein sequence of the mtPDH from Arabidopsis shows that the pPDH from Arabidopsis is 68% identical to the pPDH from red algae and 37% identical to the mtPDH from Arabidopsis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> This example describes the production of polyclonal antibodies to the E1&agr; and E1&bgr; subunits of chloroplastic PDH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Primers were designed such that the coding regions of D14 and C12 of Example 3 were incorporated into the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>expression vector pET24-a. After assembly of these two expression constructs, an expression cassette consisting of the vector promoter, the C12 coding sequence, and the vector terminator was excised from the C12 expression plasmid and incorporated into the D14 expression plasmid, yielding a tandem expression plasmid capable of simultaneously expressing both subunits of pPDH. These recombinant pPDHs were expressed in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>as insoluble inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies were purified to near homogeneity. The resulting protein was sent to the Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility of Iowa State University for production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Pre-immune and immune sera from the rabbits were tested for specificity and titer by immunoblotting against the original antigen recombinant proteins. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> This example describes the cloning of cDNA for the A and B subunits of ACL from Arabidopsis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The cDNA clones pACL-A1 and pACL-B1 were identified by sequence similarity searches of the Arabidopsis EST (Expressed Sequence Tags) database. The EST cDNA pACL-A1 (clone ID TASG097, Genbank accession &num;Z18045) was identified because the sequence of its 5&prime;-end was similar to the sequence of the 5&prime;-end of the human ATP-citrate lyase. The EST cDNA pACL-B1 (clone ID VBVYC01, Genbank accession &num;Z33810) was identified because the sequence of its 5&prime;-end was similar to the sequence near the middle of the human ATP-citrate lyase. These two clones were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University). Both strands of both clones were sequenced at the Iowa State University DNA Sequencing Facility, using an ABI automatic sequencer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The ACL-A2 sequence was identified by a BLAST sequence search of the publicly available data generated by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/agi.html). ACL-A2 is an Arabidopsis gene that is paralogous to the ACL-A1 cDNA. That is, the ACL-A2 gene codes for the same protein as the ACL-A1 cDNA, but based on the fact that the 5&prime;- and 3&prime;-untranslated regions of these two sequences are different, these two sequences represent different members of the ATP-citrate lyase gene family. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The ACL-B2 sequence was identified by screening an Arabidopsis cDNA library prepared from polyA RNA isolated from developing siliques of Arabidopsis (Castle and Meinke, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater) in the vector lambda gt10 with radioactively labeled ACL-B1 cDNA as described by Sambrook et al. (1989), supra. Briefly, approximately 200,000 recombinant phage from the library were grown on petri plates and replicated to nitrocelluose membranes. Replica filters were incubated at 65&deg; C. in hybridization solution (5&times; SSC, 1&times; Denhardt&apos;s solution, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled probe for 12 hr. After hybridization, filters were washed at 65&deg; C. in 2&times; SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and subsequently with 0.1&times; SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Recombinant plaques that hybridized with the probe were plaque-purified and a cDNA insert was subcloned into the plasmid vector pBSK for sequencing purposes. The resulting sequence was termed ACL-B2, which is a full-length cDNA clone coding for the ACL-B subunit and is encoded by a separate gene from ACL-B 1. The nucleotide sequences of ACL-B1 and ACL-B2 share about 80% identity and encode polypeptides that are over 95% identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> ACL-A1, ACL-A2, ACL-B 1 and ACL-B2 share a high degree of sequence identity with rat and human ACL. The human ACL mRNA is 4.3 kb in length and codes for a protein of 1100 residues. The ACL-A1 mRNA is 1.5 kb in length and codes for a protein of 423 residues that is 50% identical to the N-terminus of the human ACL. The ACL-A2 gene codes for a mRNA that is a paralog of the ACL-A1 mRNA; they each code for proteins that are over 98% identical even though their nucleotide sequences are only about 80% identical and their 5&prime;- and 3&prime;-untranslated regions are distinct. The ACL-A2 gene comprises 12 exons and 13 introns. The partial ACL-B 1 cDNA is 1.03 kb in length and codes for a polypeptide of 272 residues that is 50% identical to the C-terminus of the human ACL. The full-length ACL-B1 mRNA is 2.2 kb in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The deduced ACL-A and ACL-B polypeptides have no recognizable targeting sequence and, as with the rat and human ACL polypeptides, they are cytosolic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Numerous sequence databases were searched for additional orthologs of the ACL-A and ACL-B polypeptides. No orthologs were identifiable in the entire genome of the yeast <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></highlight>, which is consistent with the absence of ACL activity in this species (Kohlhaw and Tan-Wilson, <highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>129: 1159-1161 (1977)). However, orthologs of ACL-A and ACL-B have been identified in the yeast <highlight><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic></highlight>. The ACL-A ortholog is a clone of a gene that resides on chromosome 1 of <highlight><italic>S. pombe</italic></highlight>, and its amino acid sequence is over 60% identical to Arabidopsis ACL-A. The ACL-B ortholog from <highlight><italic>S. pombe </italic></highlight>is a partial cDNA clone, and its amino acid sequence shares 60% identity with that of the Arabidopsis ACL-B. Both <highlight><italic>S. pombe </italic></highlight>orthologs have been identified as ATP citrate lyases due to the high degree of sequence identity to the animal ACL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The ACL-B and ACL-A mRNAs are transcribed from two different genes. Evidence for this conclusion comes from a series of experiments. First, Arabidopsis DNA was digested with Xba I, Sac I, Hin dIII, Eco RI, and Barn HI and subjected to Southern blot hybridization using as a probe the ACL-A1 cDNA and the ACL-B cDNA. Hybridization analyses of the Arabidopsis DNA probed individually with the two cDNAs revealed that each cDNA hybridized to a nonoverlapping set of restriction fragments. Second, screening of a lambda-based Arabidopsis genomic library with pACL-A and pACL-B resulted in the isolation of two nonoverlapping sets of genomic clones that hybridize with each of the two cDNAs. Restriction digests and Southern blot analyses of the 12 genomic clones that hybridize to pACL-A enabled subclassification of the clones into two groups, which is consistent with the data from the genomic Southern blot that indicates that the ACL-A mRNA is encoded by a small gene family. Based on similar analyses, the eight pACL-B hybridizing genomic clones were subclassified into three groups, which is consistent with the data from the genomic Southern blot that indicates that the ACL-B mRNA is encoded by a small gene family. Third, the sequence of a BAC clone containing one of the ACL-A genes (ACL-A1) indicates that an ACL-B gene is not within 10 kb of the ACL-A1 gene. The ACL-A1 gene is located on chromosome 1 of Arabidopsis, and the gene sequence is interrupted by 11 introns. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> These antisera were used to probe Western blots of Arabidopsis seedling extracts. Anti-ACL-A detected a single polypeptide of 45-kDa, which is very close to the molecular weight predicted from the sequence of pACL-A (which encodes for a 423 residue polypeptide). Anti-ACL-B antibodies detected a polypeptide of about 70-kDa, which is close to that predicted based upon the size of the ACL-B mRNA (2.2-kb). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> This example describes how the cDNA encoding ACH from <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>can be used to isolate the mtACH gene from a plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> A cDNA clone encoding a plant mtACH can be identified by sequence similarity searches of the Arabidopsis EST (Expressed Sequence Tags) database (Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (http://genomewww.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/agi.html)) to the yeast ACH cDNA. Positive clones can then be obtained from the ABRC (Ohio State Resource Center). Both strands of the positive clones can then be sequenced, for example by using an ABI automatic sequencer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Given that recent efforts to identify a mtACH EST from this database have not yielded any positive clones (which could be due to the fact that the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative only contains about 20% of the genome), a plant mtACH gene can be cloned from Arabidopsis by complementation of the existing <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>mutants (Lee et al. (1990), supra). The mutant can be transformed with a library expressing Arabidopsis cDNAs in a plasmid that would replicate and express those genes in yeast (Minet et al., <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>2: 417-422 (1992)). A clone can then be selected that complements the Saccharomyces mutant and restores (e.g., wild-type) growth capability. The Arabidopsis cDNA for ACH can then be copied by PCR and the DNA fragment can then be cloned in pBS for sequencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, antisera to the yeast ACH can be generated and used to isolate mtACH from a plant. The amino acid sequence of the isolated mtACH can the be determined in whole or in part. The sequence can then be used to generate nucleic acid probes for screening a cDNA library or a genomic library in order to isolate the mtACH gene from plants. The mtACH gene from plants can then be sequenced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> If desired, antisera against the isolated plant mtACH can be used to screen an expression library for expression of mtACH. Antisera can be produced in rabbits using transgenically expressed protein from <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>. For example, the Arabidopsis cDNA for ACH can be cloned into the pET24 expression vector as a translational fusion. The plasmid can then be transformed into <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, where it would express the protein. The protein, which accumulates as an inclusion body within the bacterium, can then be purified by centrifugation and SDS-gel electrophoresis. The protein can then be supplied to the Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility at Iowa State University for the production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Pre-immune and immune sera from rabbits can then be tested for specificity and titer by immunoblotting against the original antigen recombinant protein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> This example describes the cloning of ALDH cDNAs from Arabidopsis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The deduced amino acid sequence of the maize mitochondrial ALDH, coded by the rf2 gene (Cui et al., Science 272: 1334-1336 (1996)) was used to search the dbEST database (National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) using the program BLAST. This resulted in the identification of 7 Arabidopsis EST cDNA clones (Genbank Accession &num;R83958, Z26417, N96630, T13678, R86795, AA041030, AA395226), which were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Research Center (ABRC) at Ohio State University, and they were each sequenced. All seven clones were partial cDNA. Using these EST cDNAs as probes, Arabidopsis cDNA libraries were screened as described in Example 5. This resulted in the isolation of full-length cDNA clones that corresponded to four gene products, ALDH1, ALDH2, ALDH3, ALDH4. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the Arabidopsis ALDH1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>), ALDH2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>), ALDH3 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) and ALDH4 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) are presented. BLAST sequence searches of the publicly available data generated by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/agi.html), with ALDH1, ALDH2, ALDH3 and ALDH4 nucleotide sequences confirmed that these cDNAs are products of four distinct genes. These genes occur on chromosomes 3, 3, 1 and 4, respectively, of Arabidopsis. Of these sequences, ALDH1 and ALDH3 encode the most similar proteins (they share 85% sequence similarity), whereas the similarity between ALDH1 and ALDH3 is lower (66%), and the similarity between ALDH1 and ALDH4 is even lower (40%). </paragraph>

This resulted in the identification of 6 Arabidopsis EST cDNA clones, which were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Research Center (ABRC) at Ohio State University, and they were sequenced. All six clones were partial cDNA clones, three of which (Genbank accession &num;F14476, T04727 and F14475) matched the PDC1 gene sequence, and the other three (Genbank accession &num;N97215, Z35007 and AA597828) matched the PDC2 gene sequence. Using these EST cDNAs as probes, Arabidopsis cDNA libraries were screened as described in Example 5. This resulted in the isolation of full-length cDNA clones corresponding to the PDC1 and PDC2 genes. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the Arabidopsis PDC1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) and PDC2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) are presented. The PDC1 and PDC2 cDNAs share 75% sequence identity, and they encode proteins that share 82% sequence identity or 87% sequence similarity. BLAST sequence searches of the publicly available data generated by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (http://genomewww.stanford.edu/Arabidopsis/agi.html), with PDC1 and PDC2 nucleotide sequences confirmed that these cDNAs are products of two distinct genes. These genes occur on chromosomes 4 and 5, respectively, of Arabidopsis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> This example describes the accumulation of ACL-A, ACL-B, PDH and ACS mRNAs determined by RNA blot analysis during stages of plant development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis leaves, buds, flowers, and siliques as described previously (Weaver et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>110: 1021 (1995)). Radioactive ACL-A and ACL-B RNAs were obtained by in vitro transcription from the respective pBSK clones. The RNA concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 and 260 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Ten &mgr;g of RNA from each tissue sample were fractionated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-containing agarose gels. After transfer of the RNA to nylon membranes, hybridizations were conducted in a buffer containing 50% formamide at 65&deg; C. for 12-16 hr using <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled RNA probes. Hybridized membranes were rinsed twice with 2&times; SSC, 2% SDS for 10 min at room temperature, and then washed twice with 0.1&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65&deg; C. The membranes were exposed to a phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, Calif.) for 4 hr, and the radioactivity in each band was quantified with a Storm 840 Phosphorlmager (Molecular Dynamics). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The accumulation patterns of the ACL-A and ACL-B mRNAs were identical at the level of resolution afforded by these techniques. During silique development, ACL-A and ACL-B mRNAs accumulated to the highest levels in flower buds and in developing siliques about 1-4 days after flowering. However, both ACL-A and ACLB levels tapered off in the siliques at around 8 days after flowering and were barely detectable in the siliques at 15 days after flowering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The absolute level of PDH E1&bgr; subunit mRNA accumulation (per total RNA) was greater than that of ACS mRNA in siliques at all stages of development.

<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Arabidopsis siliques (1 to 13 days after flowering) and flower buds were harvested and cut into 3-4 mm long pieces.

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-labeled probes were transcribed from vectors containing the ACL-A, ACL-B, E1 &bgr; pPDH or ACS cDNA (cloned in pBluescript SK).

<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> After hybridization, the tissue sections were coated with Kodak NTB2 emulsion, exposed for 2 to 4 days, and developed.

<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In situ hybridizations were repeated three times, using two sets of plant materials that had been independently processed, all with similar results. Control slides containing sections of siliques were hybridized with sense RNA probes transcribed from the vectors indicated above, and virtually no signal was detected in these slides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Using in situ hybridization to RNA, the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of pPDH, ACS, ACL-A and ACL-B were determined and were found to be heterogeneous. Accumulation of PDH mRNA was very high in torpedo-staged and walking-staged embryos, the stages in which oil accumulation is also highest. The pattern was almost identical to that of heteromeric acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). These results implicate pPDH as the source of the plastidic pool of acetyl CoA. In contrast to the pPDH E1&bgr; subunit mRNA, the mRNA coding for ACS accumulated to only very low levels in embryos of Arabidopsis, with maximal accumulation occurring in heart stage embryos, after which accumulation decreases. Instead, the ACS mRNA accumulated to the highest levels in the root tips of radicles of embryos in seeds from 1-4 days after imbibition, in anther filaments (especially near the junction of the filament and anther), and in the funiculus throughout seed development. Very high expression of ACS in filaments is consistent with some role of plastidic acetyl CoA in this organ. While ACS does not appear to be important in providing acetyl CoA for fatty acid synthesis for oils, the spatial and temporal expression of pPDH is consistent with this enzyme being associated with the production of acetyl CoA for oil biogenesis in developing seeds. The spatial and temporal patterns of ACL-A and ACL-B mRNAs were identical at the level of resolution afforded by these techniques. ACL-A and ACL-B mRNAs accumulated to high levels in the inner integuments of ovules the day preceding testal (seed coat) deposition; in epidermal cells of growing organs; in tapetal cells of anthers; and in epidermis and trichomes of young leaves. The co-accumulation of ACL-A and ACL-B with the cytosolic ACC indicates that ACL generates the cytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA. The higher level of accumulation of mRNAs in the epidermis may be associated with cuticular wax formation. The co-accumulation of the ACL-A, ACL-B and ACC mRNAs in the inner integument a day preceding deposition of the testa may be associated with deposition of the flavonoid polymers phlobaphens (Stafford, &ldquo;Metabolism and regulation of phenolics: gaps in our knowledge,&rdquo; in <highlight><italic>Phytochemicals and Health</italic></highlight>, D.

The mutagenized acetyl CoA-producing gene codes for an acetyl CoA-producing enzyme that is either more or less efficient in catalysis than the one encoded by the endogenous, replaced gene. The acetyl CoA-producing gene is mutagenized by one or more nucleotide deletions, insertions, duplications or replacements. The mutagenized gene is fused to a selectable marker gene and introduced into a cell.

Transformants are selected on the basis of the marker gene. Transformants are confirmed by Southern blot analysis of the DNA from putative transformants. Most of the transgenic organisms that will be derived from such experimentations will express the transgene. However, in a few cases, the transgene will co-suppress the expression of the endogenous acetyl-CoA producing gene.

For this selection, seeds were surface-sterilized by incubating them for 7 min in 50% (v/v) regular bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) and 0.02% Triton X-100 followed by rinsing them three times were sterile water. Seeds were sown in Petri plates containing MS selection medium (50 &mgr;g/ml kanamycin, 1&times; Murashige and Skoog&apos;s salts (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), 1% sucrose, 1&times; Gamborg&apos;s vitamin (Sigma), 0.5 g/l MES, pH 5.7, and 0.8% purified agar (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.)). Approximately 10-14 days after sowing, kanamycin-resistant seedlings were transferred into sterile soil (Sunshine Mix, Sun Gro Horticulture, Bellevue, Wash.). Plants were grown at 23&deg; C. either under continuous light or under a photoperiod of 16 hrs illumination followed by 8 hrs of darkness. Plants were watered once a week with Nutriculture soluble fertilizer special blend 21-8-18 (Plant Marvel Laboratory, Chicago Heights, Ill.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Each transgenic line from an individual transformed plant was considered to be an independent transformation event. In the following generations, seeds were harvested from transgenic lines individually and were further grown on MS selection medium to investigate the segregation of the kanamycin resistance trait. For each test of the segregation of kanamycin resistance, more than 30 seeds were used. A transgenic line was considered to be homozygous when there was only one copy of the transgene incorporated into its genome and all of the tested progeny seedlings (more than 50) were kanamycin resistant. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An apparatus for determining elasticity characteristics of a thin-film layer. The apparatus comprises a sensor element having a base magnetostrictive element at least one surface of which is at least partially coated with the thin-film layer. The thin-film layer may be of a variety of materials (having a synthetic and/or bio-component) in a state or form capable of being deposited, manually or otherwise, on the base element surface, such as by way of eye-dropper, melting, dripping, brushing, sputtering, spraying, etching, evaporation, dip-coating, laminating, etc. Among suitable thin-film layers for the sensor element of the invention are fluent bio-substances, thin-film deposits used in manufacturing processes, polymeric coatings, paint, an adhesive, and so on. A receiver, preferably remotely located, is used to measure a plurality of values for magneto-elastic emission intensity of the sensor element in either characterization: (a) the measure of the plurality of values is used to identify a magneto-elastic resonant frequency value for the sensor element; and (b) the measure of the plurality of successive values is done at a preselected magneto-elastic frequency. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention relates to telemetry techniques for direct measurement of, as well as measuring changes in, material characteristics such as mass, thickness, density, and elasticity. More particularly, the invention is directed to a new apparatus and method for remotely measuring or monitoring changes in characteristics relating to the elastic nature of a material at least partially coating a surface of a magnetostrictive element, including determining the material&apos;s modulus of elasticity (Young&apos;s modulus), bulk modulus, monitoring or measuring bioactive reaction responses of the material, such as coagulation reactions, blood clotting time, and so on. The sensor element is preferably remotely located (no hardwire interconnection) from an associated pick-up/receiver(s) and data processing unit(s). The thin-film/coating layer in contact with a surface of a base element may be any of a variety of inert thin-film layers or chemically-, physically-, or biologically-responsive layers (such as blood, which experiences a change in viscosity as it coagulates) for which data or material property information about the layer is desired. Among the many suitable thin-film layers for the sensor element of the invention are fluent bio-substances (such as those comprising a biologic agent or blood), thin-film deposits used in a manufacturing process, a polymeric coating, a coating of paint, and a coating of an adhesive, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, the focus is on an apparatus and technique for direct quantitative measurement of elasticity characteristic values of an unknown thin-film/coating layer (which relate to a change in mass of a bare magetoelastic element and one with any unknown coating/film in contact with a surface of the base magnetoelastic element). In another aspect of the invention, the focus is on an apparatus and technique for determining elasticity characteristics where the thin-film layer is a fluent bio-substance. The bio-substance can comprise a bio-component such as a biologic agent or blood, a non-Newtonian liquid (often making direct quantitative measurement of its characteristics using standard models and testing procedures, inaccurate). Biologic agents of interest include an antibody, a biochemical catalyst (or biocatalyst) such as an enzyme, a disease-producing agent (or pathogen) a DNA component, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Although magnetoelastic materials are currently used in connection with position sensors, identification markers, and in the commercial retail arena as anti-theft or, electronic article surveillance (EAS) tags, according to the unique technique of the invention, by examining the shift in the resonant frequency of a magnetoelastic sensor element of the invention to which a given mass load (coating/film/layer) has been applied, the elastic modulus Y if the mass load can be determined where density p of the coating/film/layer is known. One important aspect of the invention relates more-particularly to techniques for measuring the viscoelastic properties of blood, including blood coagulability tests and other techniques that measure bioactive coagulation reactions. This aspect of the invention relates specifically to a new remote-query technique for measuring coagulation/clotting time of blood, or other such bioactive coagulation reaction, whereby a drop/coating of the responsive-material (e.g., blood) is placed in contact with a surface of the magnetoelastic sensor element/substrate to which a magnetic field (having an alternating magnetic field component and a DC magnetic biasing field component) is then applied. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Anti-theft markers/tags (electronic article surveillance, EAS, markers) generally operate by &ldquo;listening&rdquo; for acoustic energy emitted in response to an interrogating AC magnetic field, to sense the presence of an EAS marker. Sensormatic, Inc. distributes an EAS tag (dimensions 3.8 cm&times;1.25 cm&times;0.04 mm) designed to operate at a fixed frequency of 58 kHz (well beyond the audible range of human hearing). These EAS tags are embedded/incorporated into articles for retail sale. Upon exiting a store, a customer walks through a pair of field coils emitting a 58 kHz magnetic field. If a tag is still in an article being carried by the customer, the tag will likewise emit a 58 kHz electromagnetic signal that can be detected using a pickup coil, which in turn may set off an audible or visual alarm. More-recently, these tags are being placed in a box-resonator, sized slightly larger than the tag, such as the tags placed within a cavity 20 of a housing (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of Winkler et al.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Winkler et al. describes an electronic article surveillance (EAS) anti-theft system that operates by detecting mechanical resonances of magnetostrictive elements made of amorphous metallic glass METGLAS&reg; 2826 MB, to prevent or deter theft of merchandise from retail establishments. In response to an interrogation signal generated by energizing circuit 201, the interrogating coil 206 generates an interrogating magnetic field, which in turn excites the integrated marker portion 12 of the article of merchandise 10 into mechanical resonance. During the period that the circuit 202 is activated, and if an active marker is present in the interrogating magnetic field, such marker will generate in the receiver coil 207 a signal at the frequency of mechanical resonance of the marker. This signal is sensed by a receiver which responds to the sensed signal by generating a signal to an indicator to generate an alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Anderson, III et al. discloses a marker 16 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) formed of a strip 18 of a magnetostrictive, ferromagnetic material adapted, when armed in its activated mode, to resonate mechanically at a frequency within the range of the incident magnetic field. A hard ferromagnetic element 44 disposed adjacent to the strip 18 is adapted, upon being magnetized, to magnetically bias the strip 18 and thereby arm it to resonate at that frequency. An oscillator provides an AC magnetic field within interrogation zone 12 to mechanically resonate a magnetostrictive strip 18, which has first been armed by a magnetized hard ferromagnetic element 44, upon exposure to this AC magnetic field. The sole object of Anderson, III et al. EAS marker is to detect the presence between coil units 22 and 24 (interrogation zone 12) of an &ldquo;armed/activated&rdquo; marker 16. In the event an activated marker 16 secured to a retail article is detected within zone 12, an alarm will sound. A deactivator system 38, electrically connected to a cash register, can be used to deactivate the marker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Humphrey and, another reference, Humphrey et al. disclose harmonic type electronic article surveillance (EAS) markers which include a thin strip or wire of magnetic material that responds to an alternativing interrogation signal by generating a signal pulse that is rich in high harmonics of the interrogation signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Schrott, et al. describes a multibit bimorph magnetic ID tag for attachment to, and identification of, an object. The tag has one or more bimorphs comprised of a thin strip of a magnetostrictive material attached to a thicker bar 21 of hard magnetic material. A shipping pallet, package, or product is tagged with the bimorph for later product identification. Schrott et al. indicates that a multibit tag could be programmed to generate a binary or other suitable code. In the binary code case, a certain frequency of an array of cantilevers can be assigned a value of &ldquo;zero&rdquo; or &ldquo;one&rdquo; and, if absent, it can take the opposite value. The Schrott, et al. ID tag is limited to coded (zeros and ones) identification of the object. If, in operation, a Schrott, et al. ID tag&apos;s resonant frequency (predetermined by size/materials) is not &ldquo;hit&rdquo; during interrogation due to some unexpected event/external factor (such as, its resonant frequency is changed due to a temperature swing, or due to reaction of the ID tag with a surrounding fluid), no response will be detected and an incorrect output code will result, thus, destroying the Schrott, et al. ID tag&apos;s function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Rather than working at a fixed interrogation frequency and simply checking for amplitude like the anti-theft EAS markers do to sense presence or absence of an active EAS tag on an article for purchase, the novel sensing apparatus and method of the invention looks to the frequency response of the sensor for information about the elasticity characteristics of a thin-film layer atop a magnetoelastic base element. Operating as a telemeter, elasticity characteristics of the thin-film layer can be obtained through remote query according to the invention, without direct hard-wire connection and without the need to ensure the sensor element&apos;s orientation in order to provide such information. In effect, the interrogation field to which the sensor element is exposed acts as a power source for the &lsquo;passive&rsquo; sensing elements of the invention which, in turn, transmits or emits information magnetically, acoustically, and optically. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">GENERAL TECHNICAL BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Knowledge of the elastic properties and characteristics of materials, including stress-strain relationships, visco-elastic behavior over time (whether or not exposed to an external agent such as air or other gas), brittleness, bioactive reaction response, and so on, often factors heavily into engineering product and manufacturing process design and analysis. Elastic moduli are closely linked to the internal structure of solids at their atomic and microstructural levels, thus offering valuable information for materials research and development. Measurements of the elastic moduli and their dependency on ambient conditions, for example temperature and pressure, help to evaluate material properties, material composition, and the utility for an intended application such as thin film deposition, or deposition of specific alloy composition in microcircuit device fabrication, and layering or lamination in a medical device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In general, coagulation is the separation or precipitation from a dispersed state of suspensoid particles resulting from their growth-the separation or precipitation resulting from prolonged heating, the addition of an electrolyte, a condensation reaction between solute and solvent, and so on (an example of which is the setting of a gel). Blood, a fluent connective tissue consisting of plasma and cells, is an example of a bio-substance that coagulates. The unique nature of blood, has caused it to be characterized as a non-Newtonian fluid; thus posing a challenge for those needing to measure bioactive reactions, as well as determine clotting and coagulation time. It is important to reliably ascertain specific information about blood and other bio-components in order to perform coagulation monitoring for surgical procedures and to monitor anticoagulant therapy delivered to patients in connection with cardiac monitoring. The coagulation process of blood relies on a well known protein cascade and its interaction with blood cells and local tissue factors (see APPENDIX A, for reference). Consequently the bleeding time at a surface wound will significantly differ from blood coagulation time in-vivo. Current methodologies for determining blood coagulation time rely on isolation of specific factors, thus requiring the removal of red blood cells to determine a plasma/fibrinogen isolated clotting time. Blood coagulability tests currently in use, clinically test the ability of blood to coagulate, such as to determine clot retraction time and quantification, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet enumeration. The apparatus and method of the invention provides a novel testing technique that can be used to determine elasticity characteristics of blood and other fluent bio-substances, as a stand-alone test or used to supplement any of the testing modalities currently available to characterize blood. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is a primary object of the invention to provide apparatus and technique for obtaining quantitative direct measurement of, as well as measuring or monitoring changes in, characteristics relating to the elastic nature of a material layer at least partially coating a surface of a base magnetostrictive element. Elasticity characteristics of interest include a modulus of elasticity (Young&apos;s modulus) value for the material, a bulk modulus value for the material, and monitoring or measuring bioactive reaction responses of the material, such as coagulation reactions, blood clotting time, and so on. No direct hard-wire connection to an interrogation field generating coil or to a magneto-elastic emission receiving coil, is needed; but rather the receiver unit is remotely located for the sensing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As can be appreciated, the innovative compact apparatus and method use a base magnetostrictive element to which a thin-film layer has been added/deposited/layered as contemplated and described herein, accommodate a variety of measurement and monitoring techniques and structural alternatives, including but not limited to the following identified features&mdash;all within the spirit and scope of design goals contemplated hereby. Advantages of providing the new elasticity sensing apparatus and associated method, include without limitation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (a) The invention can be used for one-time disposable operation (e.g., in the form of a kit) or continuous monitoring of a particular thin-film/coating/layer to observe characteristics of the thin-film as it reacts to some agent over time (e.g., observing blood as it coagulates to create a coagulation response curve or determine a blood clotting time); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (b) Versatility&mdash;The invention can be used to measure physical properties of a wide range of thin-films/coatings in connection with biomedical applications (such as within medical test samples), manufacturing operations, material science research tool applications, and so on. In the context of a disposable kit or tool for monitoring a bio-substance having a component such as a biologic agent (biocatalyst, pathogen, DNA component, etc.) or blood, the apparatus provides a portable point-of-care diagnostic tool for real-time, immediate as well as ongoing monitoring of an anticoagulation, or other medicine, therapy-such as might be needed during, prior to, or post-surgery or treatment. By offering nearly-instantaneous results, one eliminates the need for long-term storage of blood and anticoagulant treatment prior to performing the characterization of the blood (esp. since storage and such treatment may cause erroneous results). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> (c) Simplicity of use&mdash;The new sensing apparatus can produce measurement results with relative ease. Monitoring and measurement of a variety of elasticity characteristics may be performed without requiring sophisticated equipment and complicated procedures. For example, real-time monitoring of the deposit of a layer(s) in a wafer or microchip fabrication process can take place by positioning sensor elements within a vacuum chamber/clean room and remotely measuring emissions from outside the chamber, while the manufacturing process is taking place. Further, the simplicity of design allows for ready incorporation of a sensing element of the invention into self-diagnostic kits (such as is presently available for glucose monitoring of diabetic patients). The relatively small amount of blood necessary for characterization utilizing the sensing system of the invention makes collection from an unsedated, conscious patient less troublesome. Present monitoring practices require the removal of relatively large blood samples (2-10 ml) and extensive sample preparation prior to titration analysis resulting in a prolonged testing regime, which can require several hours for result generation. Use of a sensing kit incorporating a sensing element of the invention significantly reduces testing time, blood volume removed (patient distress) while still providing comparative results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> (d) Speed of results&mdash;The speed with which blood, or other sample-fluent bio-substance, may be characterized using the sensing element of the invention allows it to be used in connection with surgical procedures where constant, real-time monitoring (sampling and ready results) of blood coagulation is critical. Certain medication therapy requires, at times, nearly instantaneous evaluation/results. For example, use of anticoagulation therapy is extensive during certain cardiac surgical procedures; and whether done as an in-patient, or out-patient basis, speedy results are often imperative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (e) Structural design&mdash;The thin-film layer of interest adhered to the magnetostrictive base may be shaped or applied in a manner that optimizes the speed at which an activity, reaction, or response occurs over time to an external agent (e.g., air or humidity), allowing the sensor apparatus to provide useful information at a faster rate. The sensor elements can be formed into many different shapes of various sizes; for example, the sensor elements may be fabricated on a micro-circuit scale for use where space is extremely limited such as within small-sized sealed packaging or medical test samples (e.g., a test tube), or on a larger scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> (f) Several sensor elements may be incorporated into an array to provide a &lsquo;package&rsquo; of various information relating to elasticity characteristics of the thin-film layer by sampling simultaneously or sequentially, each of several different base elements having various different thin-film layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> (g) Receiving unit design flexibility-One unit may be built with the capacity to receive acoustic emissions (elastic waves with a frequency up into the gigahertz, GHz, range) as well as electromagnetic emissions emanating from the sensor element, or separate acoustic wave and electromagnetic wave receiving units may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> (h) Apparatus design simplicity&mdash;Reducing the number and size of components required to accomplish measurements/monitoring of elasticity characteristics reduces overall fabrication costs, making kits economically feasible, and adds to ease of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Briefly described, once again, the invention includes an apparatus for determining elasticity characteristics of a thin-film layer. The apparatus comprises a sensor element having a base magnetostrictive element at least one surface of which is at least partially coated with the thin-film layer. The thin-film layer may be of a wide variety of materials (having a synthetic and/or bio-component) in a state or form capable of being deposited, whether manually or otherwise layered, on the base element surface, such as by way of eye-dropper, melting, dripping, brushing, sputtering, spraying, etching, evaporation, dip-coating, laminating, and so on. Among the many suitable thin-film layers for the sensor element of the invention are fluent bio-substances (such as those comprising a biologic agent or blood), thin-film deposits used in a manufacturing process, a polymeric coating, a coating of paint, and a coating of an adhesive, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> There are many further distinguishing features of the apparatus and method of the invention. A receiver, preferably remotely located from the sensor element, is used to measure a plurality of values for magneto-elastic emission intensity of the sensor element: (a) in one characterization, the measure of the plurality of values is used to identify a magneto-elastic resonant frequency value for the sensor element; and (b) in another characterization, the measure of the plurality of successive values is done at a preselected magneto-elastic frequency, f<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>(the magneto-elastic resonant frequency, f<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, of the sensor element may be preselected as f<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, or some other selected frequency may be selected). In characterization (a), using a value for density of the thin-film layer and a value for mass of the base magnetostrictive element and the magneto-elastic resonant frequency value so identified, at least one of the elasticity characteristics for the thin-film layer can be determined. In characterization (b), an elasticity response profile for the thin-film layer (here, a bio-substance) can be produced by using the values for emission intensity measured. Elasticity characteristics that may be determined according to the invention include any modulus/value, as well as any elasticity response profile, that provides information as to the elasticity or general elastic nature of the thin-film layer material, including among other things: the modulus of elasticity, or Young&apos;s modulus, Y<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, or bulk modulus; any bioactive reaction response curve, such as a coagulation reaction curve for the bio-substance; and in the case of blood, a blood clotting (or coagulation) time. For example, a coagulation reaction curve (or other bioactive reaction response curve) may be produced according to the invention by plotting, over a selected response-time interval, a plurality of successive voltage values respectively associated with the plurality of successive values for magneto-elastic emission intensity measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A value for the modulus of elasticity, Y<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, of the thin-film layer can be directly obtained using an apparatus and method of the invention according to the expression:

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Eqn. 1 represents the general case where several thin-film layers from 1, 2, . . . N are applied consecutively (i&equals;1, 2, . . . N) to a base magnetostrictive element. As is readily apparent, Eqn. 1 is simplified where only one thin-film layer is deposited, thus, i&equals;1 and no summation is necessary. Here, m<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is the initial mass of the base element (without a thin-film layer) and f<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is the base element&apos;s resonant frequency measured with no thin-film layer. Once the base element is at least partially coated with one or more thin-film layers, a new mass m<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&prime;</superscript></highlight> and resonant frequency f<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&prime;</superscript></highlight> of the sensor element measured after each coating/layer is applied, are used in the summation of Eqn. 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The biologic agent and other components in the thin-film layer are preferably compatible so that any reaction or activity of the thin-film layer intended for monitoring according to the invention, will take place within the time interval during which values for magneto-elastic emission intensity of the sensor element are measured. The biologic agent can include is antibody, a biochemical catalyst, or biocatalyst, such as an enzyme, a disease-producing agent, or pathogen, a DNA component, and so on, included at as a component of the thin-film layer and for which information and/or monitoring of identified elasticity characteristics is desired. The base magnetostrictive element may be made of an alloy of an element selected from many elements known to have mangetostrictive properties such as iron, cobalt, samarium, yttrium, gadolinium, terbium, and dysprosium. The base element may take on a wide variety of shapes having at least one surface on which the thin-film layer can be deposited or layered, including elongated ribbon shapes, rectangular-elongated (whereby a length, l, of the sensor element is at least twice its width, w), circular, oval, polygonal, etc.; those shapes that allow sufficient vibration of the sensor element and remote receipt of its emissions, are preferred. Depending upon the means of depositing employed, the thin-film layer can readily be applied so that its thickness, t<highlight><subscript>tf</subscript></highlight>, is less than a thickness, t<highlight><subscript>mag</subscript></highlight>, of the base magnetoelastic element (such as could be the case if the thin-film layer is sputtered onto the base element according to microcircuit fabrication techniques). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A sensor element of the invention can emit different types (generally EM waves are lumped by frequency ranges over the EM Frequency Spectrum) of measurable emissions when exposed to a time-varying interrogation magnetic field. The interrogation field may be generated continuously over time (such as over a selected time interval) or the interrogation field may be generated in the form of a pulse, after which the measurement of emission intensity is made. Depending upon the receiver, the emissions measured may be acoustic, electromagnetic, or optical in nature. Electromagnetic emissions are received by an EM pick-up coil. If acoustic emissions from a sensor element are targeted, an electroacoustic receiving device containing a transducer for operation over a range of frequencies from 1 KHz to 1 GHz may be used. Optical waves are received by an optical receiving device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Associated with the apparatus disclosed hereby, the invention also covers a method for determining elasticity characteristics of a thin-film layer at least partially coating a surface of a base magnetostrictive element. In a first characterization of the method of the invention, steps include: applying a time-varying interrogation magnetic field to a sensor element comprising the base magnetostrictive element and thin-film layer, operatively arranged to vibrate in response to the interrogation magnetic field; remotely measuring a plurality of values for magneto-elastic emission intensity of the sensor element to identify a magneto-elastic resonant frequency value therefor; and using a value for density of the thin-film layer and a value for mass of the base magnetostrictive element and and magneto-elastic resonant frequency value, determining at least one of the elasticity characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a second characterization of the method of the invention, once a time-varying interrogation magnetic field is applied to a sensor element comprising the base magnetostrictive element and thin-film layer of a fluent bio-substance, a plurality of successive values for magneto-elastic emission intensity of the sensor element at a preselected magneto-elastic frequency are remotely measured. Using the values for emission intensity measured over a selected response-time interval, an elasticity response profile for the bio-substance can be produced. The elasticity response profile can comprise a coagulation reaction curve, or other bioactive reaction response curve, for the bio-substance. Other information relating to elasticity characteristics of the thin-film fluent bio-substance layer can be obtained according to the invention, including clotting/coagulation time, enzyme reaction time, pathogen growth, and so on.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> schematically depicts components of an apparatus and method of the invention for remote query of a thin-film layer or coating <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> atop a base magnetostrictive element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A time-varying magnetic field <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is applied to sensor element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with a layer/coating <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of interest having been deposited onto a surface of the base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, by way of a suitable drive coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such that emissions <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> from the sensor element can be picked-up by a suitable pick-up coil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Two useful ways to measure the frequency spectrum include: frequency domain measurement and the time domain measurement. In the frequency domain measurement, the sensing element&apos;s vibration is excited by an alternating magnetic field of a monochromatic frequency. The amplitude of the sensor response is then registered while sweeping (&lsquo;listening&rsquo;) over a range of frequencies that includes the resonance frequency of the sensor element. Finding the maximum amplitude of the sensor response leads to the characteristic resonant frequency. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> graphically depicts interrogation field transmissions from a drive coil (SEND) in both the frequency domain <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and in the time-domain <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (an impulse of, say, 200 A/m and 8 &mgr;s in duration). The transient response (emissions) captured <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is converted to frequency domain <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> using a FFT to identify a resonant frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As it is well known, electric and magnetic fields are fundamentally fields of force that originate from electric charges. Whether a force field may be termed electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic hinges on the motional state of the electric charges relative to the point at which field observations are made. Electric charges at rest relative to an observation point give rise to an electrostatic (time-independent) field there. The relative motion of the charges provides an additional force field called magnetic. That added field is magnetostatic if the charges are moving at constant velocities relative to the observation point. Accelerated motions, on the other hand, produce both time-varying electric and magnetic fields termed electromagnetic fields. For general reference see the textbook, <highlight><italic>Engineering Electromagnetic Fields and Waves, </italic></highlight>Carl T. A. Johnk, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Edition (1988). One well known wide use of these principles of electromagnetism is the transformer: An assembly having a ferromagnetic core around which a primary coil carrying a time-varying current is wound and a secondary coil is wound&mdash;see attached APPENDIX B for reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Magnetic material/substances exhibit magnetic and elastic phenomena. Magnetic interaction depend of the distance of the interacting particles and consequently magnetic and mechanic effected interact. In ferromagnetic materials, magnetostriction is observed: The dimensions and elastic properties of magnetic materials often depend on the state of magnetization (direct magnetoelastic effect). Materials that possess both effects, especially magnetically soft ferromagnetic materials (i.e. materials having a low coercive forces), are commonly referred to as magnetoelastic materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Simply stated, &ldquo;magnetostriction&rdquo; is the phenomena whereby a material will change shape (dimensions) in the presence of an external magnetic field. This effect is brought about by the reordering of the magnetic dipoles within the material. Since the atoms in a magnetostrictive material are not, for all practical purposes, perfectly spherical (they&apos;re shaped more like tiny ellipsoids) the reordering of the dipoles causes an elongation (or contraction depending on the mode of reorientation) of the lattice which leads to a macroscopic shape change in the material. Note that there is a &ldquo;reverse magnetostrictive effect&rdquo;, also known as the Villari effect: When an external stress is applied to a magnetostrictive material, a strain develops within the material which induces a surrounding magnetic field. Known magnetostrictive materials include alloys of iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), samarium (Sm), yttrium (Y), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (TB), and dysprosium (Dy). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Magnetostrictive magnetoelastic materials efficiently convert magnetic energy to mechanical elastic energy, and vice versa. Amorphous metallic glassy ribbons or wires posses a low magnetocrystalline anisotropy field and low intrinsic stress, allowing efficient magnetoelastic energy conversion; these alloys are manufactured in a melt quenching process. There are many magnetostrictive materials currently available that may be used to construct a sensing element of the invention. Two suitable amorphous metallic (glassy) alloys are commercially available under the brand names of METGLAS&reg; (a registered trademark of Honeywell International, Inc.) and SENSORVAC&reg; (a registered trademark of Vaccumschmelze (VAC) Corporation) alloys. The amorphous cobalt based alloy known commercially as METGLAS&reg; 2826 MB (distributed by Allied Signal, Inc. in New Jersey) is vacuum annealed in the presence of a DC magnetic field to enhance magnetostriction. Another available magnetostrictive amorphous Co-based magnetically soft alloy is known commercially as ATALANTE&reg; film, distributed by Innovative Sputtering Technology N.V. of Karreweg, Belgium (this film is used throughout Europe in anti-theft retail item markers). The composition, and any tempering done, of the material chosen for construction of the magnetostrictive sensing element will affect operating characteristics of a sensor structure built therewith. It is preferable to choose a magnetostrictive material that remains relatively stable (i.e., its material properties do not change a significant amount) over the expected range of operating temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> When a sample of magnetoelastic material is exposed to an alternating magnetic field, it starts to vibrate. This external time-varying magnetic field can be a time-harmonic signal or a non-uniform field pulse (or several such pulses transmitted randomly or periodically). If furthermore a steady DC magnetic field is superimposed to the comparatively small AC magnetic field, these vibrations occur in a harmonic fashion, leading to the excitation of harmonic acoustic waves inside the sample. The mechanical oscillations cause a magnetic flux change in the material due to the inverse magnetoelastic effect. These flux changes, in unison with the mechanical vibrations, can be detected in a set of EM emission pick-up coils. The vibrations of the sample are largest if the frequency of the exciting field coincides with the characteristic acoustic resonant frequency of the sample. Thus, the magnetoelastic resonance frequency detectable by an EM pick-up coil coincides with the frequency of the acoustic resonance. And, sensor element emissions can be detected acoustically, for example by a remote microphone/hydrophone or a piezoelectric crystal, by detecting the acoustic wave generated from the mechanical vibrations of the sensor. A relative-maximum response of the emissions remotely measured is identified to determine the sensing element&apos;s characteristic resonant frequency. The emissions from a sensing element of the invention can also be monitored optically whereby amplitude modulation of a laser beam reflected from the sensor surface is detected. Signal processing of the sensor elements can take place in the frequency-domain or in the time-domain using a field-pulse excitation. </paragraph>

In addition to labeling cross-sectional area of the base element, A<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>, and cross-sectional area for the coating/layer, A<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, total thickness of the sensor element is T<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> schematically depicts geometry of an infinitesimal section &Dgr;L and &Dgr;L&prime; (for purposes of derivations made, below) of the sensor element of the invention represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> comprising the base element with coating/thin-film layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> collectively: The element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a surface <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on which the thin-film layer/coating has been deposited in a mamier corresponding and compatible with the type of material/substance of the layer and the type of information desired from the test/monitoring or measurement. The thin-film layer may be of a wide variety of materials (having a synthetic and/or bio-component) in a state or form capable of being deposited, whether manually or otherwise layered, on the base element surface, such as by way of an eye-dropper, melting, dripping, brushing, sputtering, spraying, etching, evaporation, dip-coating, laminating, and so on. Among the many suitable thin-film layers for the sensor element of the invention are fluent bio-substances (such as those comprising a biologic agent or blood), thin-film deposits used in a manufacturing process, a polymeric coating, a coating of paint, and a coating of an adhesive, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the magneto-elastic emission from a sensor element of the invention may be an acoustic emission, an electromagnetic emission, or other detectable wave type emitted by the sensor. The type of receiver used (such as an electroacoustic device containing a transducer or an electromagnetic pick-up coil) will depend upon the type of magneto-elastic emission intended for measurment. If EMV emission intensity is to be measured by the receiver, one may choose to perform such measurement after the time-varying magnetic interrogation field has been turned off (e.g., a magnetic field pulse). Ferromagnetic materials which are inherently magnetostrictive. Suitable alloys for use as the base element <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, known for their magnetostrictive properties include: iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), samarium (Sm), yttrium (Y), gadoliniumn (Gd), terbium (TB), and dysprosium (Dy). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A piece of ferromagnetic material exposed to a time-varying (sinusoidal) magnetic field will in turn emit acoustic and thermal energy due to the changes in size and viscous flexing of the material. An acoustic wave is defined as an elastic wave with a frequency that may extend into the gigahertz (GHz) range. Acoustic transmission is that transfer of energy in the form of regular mechanical vibration through a gaseous, liquid, or solid medium. Acoustic emission is the phenomenon of transient elastic-wave generation due to a rapid release of strain energy caused by a structural alteration in a solid material (stress-wave emission). An ultrasonic wave is one that has a frequency above about 20 KHz Oust above human hearing). Additionally, exposure of a time-varying magnetic field will induce a time-varying current in a ferromagnetic sample such that it will emit EM energy. A magnetostrictive base element placed within an environment generally reacts to temperature variations as follows: A large swing or change in temperature of the environment will change the Young&apos;s modulus of elasticity of an element, resulting in a corresponding change in the resonant frequency of the base element. It is preferred that an alloy be chosen for the invention having material properties that remain generally unchanged over a selected range of operating temperatures. </paragraph>

Higher harmonic frequencies can be determined by multiplying the right-hand side of Eqn. 2 by successive integer values, i.e. n&equals;1, 2, 3, 4, . . . . As noted, Young&apos;s modulus E of a magnetostrictive piece of material is dependent upon temperature T and applied static magnetic field H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The frequency of the magnetoelastic resonance coincides with the resonance of the acoustic vibration. Thus, the resonance of the sensor ribbon can be modeled as the mechanical resonance of a thin longitudinally vibrating bar. According to the fundamentals of acoustic theory, a bar fixed in its center and vibrating longitudinally with free ends has resonant frequencies:

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Looking at Eqn. 10 one can see that the sensitivity (i.e., the change of the resonant frequency due to an applied coating) depends upon the ratio &bgr; of the sound velocity in the coating to that in the sensor. If the ratio &bgr; were close to one, the resonant frequency would not change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Many factors, such as anisotropy, residual stress, temperature, pressure of the environment, and demagnetizing factor have an influence on the actual state of magnetization of the sensor material. Due to the &Dgr;E-effect, this directly affects the resonant frequency. Since the sound velocity of the sensor material can be derived from the resonance frequency, the same state of magnetization has to be restored in order to get reproducible measurements. It has been identified that to achieve this, one can sweep the DC biasing field and measuring the minimal resonant frequency with respect to the bias field before and after deposition of the coating. Suppose a bare sensor element, of which the initial mass m<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and initial resonant frequency f<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>are known or measured, is coated with one or more consecutive layers (i&equals;1,2 . . . N) of an elastic material while the new masses m<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&prime;</superscript></highlight> and resonant frequencies f<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&prime;</superscript></highlight> after each coated layer are measured. Then the elasticity of the coating/layer can be calculated by curve-fitting the measurement data according to Eqn. 1 identified above. Thus, once more, a value for the modulus of elasticity, Y<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, of the thin-film layer can be directly obtained using an apparatus and method of the invention according to the expression:

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Eqn. 1 represents the general case where several thin-film layers from 1, 2, . . . N are applied consecutively (i&equals;1,2 . . . N) to a base magnetostrictive element. Eqn. 1 is simplified where only one thin-film layer is deposited, thus, i&equals;1 and no summation is necessary. Here, m<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is the initial mass of the base element (without a thin-film layer) and f<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is the base element&apos;s resonant frequency measured with no thin-film layer. Once the base element is at least partially coated with one or more thin-film layers, a new mass m<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&prime;</superscript></highlight> and resonant frequency f<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&prime;</superscript></highlight> of the sensor element measured after each coating/layer is applied, are used in the summation of Eqn. 1. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a schematic representing further details of an apparatus of the invention, here using a system of Helmholtz coils <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B paired to generate (signal generator labeled, for reference, at <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as well as lock in amp <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and reference in <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) an interrogation field by way of electrical communication pathways <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>B to cause the sensor element to vibrate and emit energy for receipt by the pick-up coil <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. For simplicity in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the sensor element (such as that at <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) is not shown and labeled here, but is positioned between coils <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B for exposure to the interrogation field generated thereby. In the setup of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> probe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has been positioned for measuring/monitoring the interrogation field generated (especially for purposes of experimentation). A processor incorporated into the unit labeled computer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> can be used to process the sensor information received by the pick-up coil <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for output in suitable form, by way of screen display, printout, or other visual display device capable of communicating the elasticity characteristics information to a user. Well known graphic user interface devices may be employed here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates an end view looking into the round of the Helmholtz coil pair of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> at the pick-up coil (here, encased in a rectangular configuration also labeled <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) and the Hall probe <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. As can be seen better in the close-up view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> labeled <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and pick-up coil <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are collectively supported by a shelf/support-member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The receptacle is shown holding the sensor element. The sensor element <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is comprised of a drop of a bio-substance (such as blood) at <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> deposited on a surface of base element <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, for purposes of controlling the environment around the sensor element <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when elasticity characteristics measurements are taken according to the invention (for example, to produce a bioactive response curve illustrating coagulation), the receptacle <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> has a hinged cover <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The cover can be positioned over the element <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> graphically depicts the shift in resonant frequency from f<highlight><subscript>01 </subscript></highlight>for a base magetostrictive element (curve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>) to f<highlight><subscript>02 </subscript></highlight>for a sensor element (base element with layer, here by way of example, 4 &mgr;L of blood, labeled curve <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>)&mdash;resonant frequency shifts to left due to addition of mass. As shown, selection of a frequency, here identified as f<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, along the steep downward sloping portion of curve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (where voltage is changing rapidly for a given frequency) is done (Point X). At the selected frequency, f<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, the reaction kinetics of the loaded sensing element unit is observed. By monitoring at the selected frequency, f<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, the voltage change over time at that frequency can be tracked. As surface viscosity changes (e.g., blood coagulates) the voltage response profile gives valuable information concerning the coagulation process. In producing a bioactive reaction curve (such as a coagulation response curve) according to the invention, one might select f<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, f<highlight><subscript>02</subscript></highlight>, or f<highlight><subscript>01 </subscript></highlight>for monitoring emissions from the sensor element (base element with thin-film layer) over a time interval, At, such that emission measurements are obtained and plotted for at least from time t&equals;0 to t&equals;z. For example, if f<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is selected, one could observe the change in voltage from V<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>(t&equals;0) to V<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>(t&equals;z) to produce curves such as the various profiles illustrated by way of example in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, wherein the change in voltage measured by sensing emissions of the sensor element over time is plotted to visually track the coagulation process of a thin-film layer (which, in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is blood of various mammals). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, bioactive response curves for four samples of blood (here, by way of example, taken from a rat) are illustrated. One can see that comparisons may be made of blood from different animals according to the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> graphically depicts bioactive response curves for two samples of human blood, one taken from a subject that does not smoke (curve labeled <highlight><bold>655</bold></highlight>) and another for a subject that does (curve labeled <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> graphically depicts bioactive response curves for four samples of blood (here, by way of example, taken from different fingers from a human subject-the curves labeled consecutively as <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> for reference) to illustrate comparison and repeatability of the technique of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> graphically depicts bioactive response curves for four samples of blood (here, by way of example, taken from several different horses) to illustrate that comparisons may be made of blood from different animals according to the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> graphically depicts several curves illustrating the change in frequency response as human blood (taken from one subject) coagulates. As the blood bio-layer starts coagulating (whereby its viscosity changes with time) the resonant frequency peak continues to shift downwardly and to the left as illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> illustrates, in flow diagram format, details of the further distinguishing features of a method <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for determining elasticity characteristics of a thin-film layer at least partially coating a surface of a base magnetostrictive element. This diagram aids in understanding operation of the apparatus as well as in appreciating the novel features of a method of the invention and is readily understood by following the detailed explanation in each box shown in flow-diagram format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> From a frequency response curve produced for a sensing element with blood, one might select a frequency at which voltage is changing rapidly: For example, one might choose a point on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> at f<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>in the steep downwardly sloping portion of curve <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, to the left of the point at which a relative maximum voltage reading occurs&mdash;this relative max. corresponding with the characteristic resonant frequency of the sensor structure. At the preselected frequency, the magnetoelastic emissions from a sensor element to which a drop of blood has been placed (sometimes &lsquo;loaded&rsquo; sensing element) are measured over a selected period of time, &Dgr;t (ranging from several seconds to several minutes), while the blood coagulates. In this manner, data collected over &Dgr;t may be used to create a response profile to characterize the blood sample: For example, emission intensity measured over &Dgr;t as voltage readings using a suitable pick-up coil system, allows one to construct rresponse profiles such as those shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (V vs. time). Alternatively, by measuring magnetoelastic emissions from a sensing element (base element plus coating/layer) over &Dgr;t, and tracking the change in characteristic resonant frequency f<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>(or a harmonic, f<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, thereof) by, for example, converting relative maximum emission values measured by the pick-up coil into resonant frequency values, a frequency-response profile can be created (f<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>vs. time) for the sensing element against which later blood-samples taken and measured can be compared, for clinical purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the method described above to characterize using resonant frequency data of an unknown coating/layer atop a magnetoelastic sensing element, one can use the apparatus of the invention to measure coagulation of blood/bioactive coagulation reactions in the following manner. First, the characteristic resonant frequency for a loaded sensing element of selected material and dimensions (for example, in a strip/ribbon shape of METGLAS&reg; amorphous alloy) is identified, f<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>in the curve above. As the blood/solution coagulates at the strip surface the resultant change in surface characteristics/viscosity will result in a change in the sensing unit&apos;s resonant frequency. This can be shown graphically, later-in-time, as a shift along the X-axis to the left of the frequency response curve (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> graphically representing the shift to the left of the base magetostrictive element to which a thin-film layer has been added). By way of further example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> graphically illustrates the shift to the left in frequency response over time of a sensing element to which blood has been added; as one can see, the resonant frequency peak decreases and shifts go the left as the blood coagulates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> By way of example only: For 500 nm thick films, the measured Young&apos;s modulus of elasticity for Al and Ag was found according to the invention, to be within 1.6% of standard data; and the elasticity of coatings approximately 30 nm thick were handily measured. In the event a &ldquo;package&rdquo; of different types of sensing information about one environment is sought, more than one sensor may be maintained in an ordered array, for example, by being organized to extend along or contained within chambers of a support member. Each sensor within the array may have a distinct operating range, allowing the receiver to distinguish emissions received from each separate sensor. Thus, the separate types of sensing information can be obtained, tracked and computed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Selected isotopes are useful in a variety of applications. For example, it is often desired to have an isotopic marker present in a molecule to trace such molecule in biologic processes. Radioactive isotopes are used for curative purposes in cancer and for medical radiology. Isotopic enrichment is used by industry to control physical properties of materials such as thermal conductivity. Separation of isotopes is conventionally accomplished by a variety of means relying on difference in mass of isotopes. One example of this utilizes a gaseous diffusion process to separate heavier components of an isotopic mixture from the lighter components by reason of their differing mass. Physical separation by fractionation to isolate a particular desired isotope is also known. Conventionally, the most popular procedure for isotope enrichment is the gaseous-diffusion method, which depends on the relative rates of gaseous diffusion through molecular barriers by different isotopes of a given element. Such processes typically operate at reduced pressure and elevated temperature. Often the difference between the mass of the isotopes is very small and although the lighter weight isotope diffuses more rapidly through porous barriers, the separation by each barrier is very, very small, therefore, many or a cascade of barriers are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More recently, there has been an interest in attempting to cause isotope separation by multiple photon absorption and photoionization. These processes are labor intensive and difficult to accomplish. Typically, several iterations are required to achieve the high concentration of the desired isotopic component in the separated product. An example of separation by multiple photon absorption can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,655,890 where a mixture of molecules is irradiated with infrared laser radiation having a first wavelength which lies in close coincidence with the transition from the ground rotation-vibration level of the molecules which contain the isotopic variant of the element which is to be separated, and the next highest rotation-vibration level having vibrational excitation. This radiation selectively induces multiple photon absorption by those molecules. Then it is possible to cause the selectively excited molecules to undergo chemical reaction while other isotopic variance of the element remains substantially in their lower rotation-vibration levels and consequently unreactive, thereby causing a product of the chemical reaction of the selectively excited molecules to be produced and separable from the unreacted molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the parent of the present application, a novel process and system apparatus were described for separating isotopes of an element and causing enrichment of a desired isotope of an element in a material. In one aspect, a laser was used to modify or fabricate a material so as to produce a desired isotopic content in the material, which differs from that which naturally occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Isotope enrichment in laser ablation plumes is predominantly an ionic process. Such a process involves the interaction of energetic ions produced in the ablation plasma with self generated magnetic fields in the same plasma. Details about the theory of this self generated magnetic field process and its effects on the motion of isotopic ions in an ablation plasma continue to be studied and worked out. However, it is recognized that by maximizing the ionic component of the plasma, the number density of isotopes that undergo the enrichment process can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the ratio of ions to neutrals in a single ablation plasma plume is relatively small. Typically that ratio is on the order of 1% or less. To achieve a practical method for using this phenomenon as a way to harvest enriched isotopes, it would be desired to increase this ionic component to much greater levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A single laser ablation plume is the result of a number of relatively complex processes occurring during the absorption of a laser pulse by a material and subsequent expansion of the gaseous/plasma plume. One part of this process involves the initial production of a very large percentage of ions if not complete ion content in the vapor phase plasma. In other words, the system starts out as a fully ionized electron-ion plasma. Because of the high initial density and ensuing collisions in at the early vapor/plasma stage, however, a great deal of electronic neutralization occurs as the plasma expands away from the surface of the ablating material. This highly neutralized plasma then moves through the region of the self-generated magnetic field and the ionic component undergoes the isotope enrichment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A plasma having a density which exceeds a certain level, known as the &ldquo;critical density&rdquo;, begins to reflect optical radiation rather than absorb it. The absorption properties of a plasma normally increase with the density of free electrons in it. However, when the density reaches the critical density the plasma becomes nearly totally reflective. This limits the amount of internal energy that can be added to a plasma by a laser pulse. In most cases where an ablation plasma is formed by a laser this critical density is achieved in the early part of the laser pulse impinging on the surface of the material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a novel process and system apparatus for separating isotopes of an element and causing enrichment of a desired isotope of an element in a material. In one aspect, the invention utilizes lasers to modify or fabricate a material so as to produce a desired isotopic content in the material, which differs from that which naturally occurs. The reference to a condition different from that which naturally occurs refers to both enhancement and depletion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relies upon laser induced formation of a plasma by means of a pulsed laser beam. The material containing the isotopes desired to be separated is placed in the beam path and is called a target. A plasma is formed from the target material by focusing an intense, short duration optical pulse from the laser onto the target. The concentrated energy contained in the focused and/or concentrated laser beam ionizes the target material, energizing its electrons and raising it to a temperature or otherwise exciting it to a condition whereby ions are produced, thereby generating a plasma. The plasma contains ions having varying isotopes, ion energy and charge state distributions. In one aspect, the ions are contained in a plasma plume generated when laser pulses are directed to a target. The process and system of the invention produce an unusual isotopic enhancement effect in the observed ion spectra. This effect is manifested as an enrichment of the lighter isotope in zones of the ablation plume, as observed normal to the surface of the target material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the method comprises directing the laser beam to the target at an intensity and wavelength sufficient to generate the plasma comprising ionized isotopic species and to generate an internal electromagnetic scattering field within the plasma causing spatial separation of the ionized isotopic species. In another aspect, the ions are collected on a substrate in a manner which provides zones having isotopic distribution different from that which naturally occurs for a given element contained in the target. It is preferred that the pulses which generate the plume be produced by an ultrafast laser (femtosecond or picosecond). It is preferred that the laser generates the plume by ablation or laser induced breakdown (LIB) of the target material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the method comprises directing an initial pulse of the laser beam to the target at an intensity and wavelength sufficient to generate the plasma comprising ionized isotopic species and to generate an internal electromagnetic scattering field within the plasma causing spatial separation of the ionized isotopic species. The dense plasma is then allowed to expand so that its volume increases and its electron density decreases. This brings the density of the plasma equal to or less than the critical density. During the expansion process a certain degree of neutralization occurs in the plasma which additionally reduces the free electron concentration. After allowing the expansion to occur, a time delayed second pulse of the laser beam is directed to the plasma to further spatially separate the ionized isotopic species. By correctly delaying the time of the second pulse, additional energy is absorbed by the plasma and the ionic component increases. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The invention provides new methods for separating isotopes of an element and causing enrichment of a desired isotope of an element utilizing lasers to modify or fabricate a material containing such isotopes. This invention may be used for a wide variety of materials which contain elements having different isotopes. Before further describing the invention, it is useful to understand the problem to which the invention is directed. In nature, elements such as boron, gallium, magnesium, carbon and many others, occur in stable isotopic form. For example, boron has two isotopes; boron 10, B(10), and boron 11, B(11). Nuclei with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons are called isotopes of each other. Therefore, isotopes of a given element have the same nuclear charge (protons), but the differing number of neutrons results in a differing atomic mass. For a given element, the amount of an isotope in its naturally occurring mixture of isotopes, is represented by a term designated as percent natural abundance. These natural abundance values are reported in a variety of Standard Chemistry and Physics Handbooks and other sources. Using boron as an example, it is known that boron 10 has a natural abundance on the order of 19.78% and boron 11 is about 80.22%. It is often desired to obtain a material enriched with one of the isotopes relative to the condition found in the natural state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention utilizes laser heating and other forms of laser induced breakdown of a material to cause ablation and formation of a plasma by means of a pulsed laser beam. Pulsed rather than continuous beams may be more effective for many procedures, including the formation of an ablation plume from a material containing isotopes desired to be separated. A pulsed laser beam comprises bursts or pulses of light which are of very short duration, for example, on the order of nanoseconds in duration or less. Typically, these pulses are separated by periods of quiescence. The peak power of each pulse is relatively high, capable of intensity on the order of 10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>watts/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The present invention utilizes one or more laser pulses having selected pulse width, repetition rate, wavelength and intensity of the laser beam at the plasma-forming material, to form a plasma of the material. Under certain circumstances, continuous laser beams are also thought to be useful for the above purposes. Such continuous wave (CW) lasers are preferably operated in a range of 10 microns to 200 nanometer wavelength and average energy in the range of joules to hundreds of joules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The material containing the isotopes desired to be separated is placed in the beam path and is called a target. A plasma is formed from the target material by focusing or otherwise delivering an intense, optical pulse from the laser onto the target. The concentrated energy contained in the focused laser beam is absorbed by the target material, energizing its electrons and raising it to a temperature or other form of excited state whereby ions are produced thereby generating a plasma. The extent of material affected by the laser pulse is dependent upon a number of factors including pulse duration, energy, and wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a method and system apparatus, including laser, for producing ions having varying isotopic, ion energy and charge state distributions. In one aspect, the ions are contained in a plasma plume generated when one or more laser pulses are directed to a target. In another aspect, the ions are collected on a substrate in a manner which provides zones having isotopic distribution different from that which naturally occurs for a given element contained in the target. It is preferred that the pulses which generate the plume be produced by an ultrafast laser (femtosecond or picosecond) which generates the plume by ablation or laser induced breakdown (LIB) of the target material. Such ultrafast pulses, however, are not thought to be the only way to optimize the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Thus, the process and system of the invention produce an unusual isotopic enhancement effect in the observed ion spectra. This effect is manifested as an enrichment of the lighter isotope in zones of the ablation plume, as observed normal to the surface of the target material. The relative intensity of this effect was observed to vary with the charge-state and energy of the ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Generation and Analysis of the Plume </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The process of the invention has been utilized to produce boron and gallium isotopes in respective ablation plumes coming from boron nitride and gallium nitride solid target. The plume was generated in a system as schematically shown in the diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> laser beam was supplied to the deposition chamber which contained the target. In the experiments described herein, the laser beam was generated by one of two types of laser systems. One was an ultrafast Ti:Sapphire-based laser system developed at the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (CUOS) for the femtosecond and picosecond data sets. The other one was a commercial Nd:YAG Laser for the nanosecond data set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Nominally, the ultrafast laser system produces 100 femtosecond amplified laser pulses at 10 Hertz and a wavelength of 780 nanometers. The pulse energy can be as high as 100 millijoules and with a peak-to-background contrast as high as 10<highlight><superscript>8</superscript></highlight>. The laser system consists of a number of components and utilizes chirped-pulse amplification (CPA). CPA avoids damage in amplifier media by reducing the peak intensity during amplification. The ultrashort pulse is stretched in time by chirping the pulse, that is, giving the pulse a time-varying wavelength. The stretched pulse is amplified and then recompressed to give an amplified, ultrashort pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The oscillator is a commercial Ti:Sapphire system from Clark-MXR, Inc. which is pumped by a CW (continuous-wave) Argon laser, also commercial. The mode-locked oscillator produces 50-femtosecond pulses at 100 MegaHertz with a pulse energy of 2 nanojoules. The bandwidth and center wavelength are tunable and are nominally 15 nanometers and 780 nanometers, respectively. A Pockels cell is used to reduce the repetition rate to 10 Hertz which is the (nominal) maximum rate this particular system can handle due to thermal effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The oscillator pulse is stretched in time to 230 picoseconds by a grating-based stretcher. The efficiency of the stretcher is 50% and its output is a 1-nanojoule, 230-picosecond pulse. The amplification chain consists of three amplifiers. (1) The regenerative amplifier is a Ti:Sapphire laser cavity pumped by 5 millijoules of the doubled frequency of a Nd:YAG laser (532 nanometers). It can amplify the pulse nominally from 1 nanojoule to 1 millijoule. (2) The two-pass amplifier is a Ti:Sapphire crystal pumped by 120 millijoules of the same Nd:YAG laser used for the regenerative amplifier. Two passes in this crystal amplifies the pulse from 1 millijoule to 20 millijoules. (3) The four-pass amplifier is a Ti:Sapphire crystal pumped by two high-power Nd:YAG lasers (at a doubled frequency of 532 nanometers). The total pump energy is 1.2 joules and can amplify the pulse from 20 millijoules to 200 millijoules. The pulse is then recompressed by a grating pair to a nominal pulse width of 100 femtoseconds. The compressor is in a vacuum chamber to avoid self-phase modulation and other nonlinear effects of the high-intensity pulse in air. The compressor has an efficiency of 50% and outputs 100-femtosecond, 100-millijoule pulses. Background concerning CPA laser systems and lasing using short optical pulse can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,235,606 and 5,656,186, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the experiments described here, two outputs of the above-described laser system were used: (1) the ultrashort pulse which is 780 nanometers and has a duration of 150 or 200 femtoseconds; and (2) the stretched, amplified pulse which is 780 nanometers and has a duration of 230 picoseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The nanosecond laser used in this research is a Continuum Surelite I Nd:YAG laser which has a nominal pulse width of 6 nanoseconds at a wavelength of 1.06 microns and a pulse energy of 450 millijoules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For the experiments, the beam had pulse widths in the nanosecond (ns) to femtosecond (fs) range, repetition rate on the order of 10 Hz, intensity in the range of 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>watts per square centimeter (w/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), and wavelength on the order of one micron. The laser beam was focused and directed to the target through a lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The laser pulse was directed at the target at an angle to the target of approximately 45 degrees. The laser beam ablated the target material and generated a plume. The specific angle of laser impingement on the target is not thought to be critical. However, it is important to note that the ablation plume leaves the surface of the material in a direction that is essentially normal to the surface, that is, at a 90 degree angle to the surface. The target could be any material including amorphous or crystalline solids, liquids or gases including high density plasma/gas state. The examples described herein were solids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The center of the plume was directed toward a set of apertures that acted as collimating devices and introduced the ions into the ion energy analyzer. This analyzer was a conventional curved (spherical) sector plate electrostatic energy analyzer. When it was operated in a time of flight mode, through synchronization with the laser pulse, the analyzer was also capable of uniquely separating ion charge states. Discrete energy distributions of the individual charge states for ions in the ablation plume were obtained by sweeping the analyzing voltage on the sector plates and using time of flight synchronization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Monitoring Ion Charge, Energy and Distribution of Charge and Energy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The energies and charge-states in the ablation plume reported herein were measured using a spherical-sector electrostatic energy analyzer. The ions entered the analyzer and passed between two curved spherical-sector plates. A voltage up to 5000 volts was placed on each of the plates. An ion passing between the plates is influenced by this voltage which curves the path of the ion. The magnitude of this force depends on the voltage on the plates and on the charge-state and energy of the ion. Specifically, for a certain voltage difference on the plates, only ions with a certain energy-to-charge ratio will follow the path and reach the detector (the MCPs). In the geometry of this analyzer, the energy-to-charge ratio (E/q) of the selected ions is equal to 2.254 times the voltage difference (V<highlight><subscript>diff</subscript></highlight>) between the spherical-sector plates which gives the equation: (E/q)selected&equals;2.254&times;V<highlight><subscript>diff </subscript></highlight>where E/q is in units of electron volts (eV), and V<highlight><subscript>diff </subscript></highlight>is in volts (V). For positive ions, a negative voltage was placed on the inner plate and a positive voltage on the outer plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A specific voltage difference between the plates gives ions with a particular energy-to-charge ratio. The detector will observe a charge state 1 ion with a specific energy E as determined by the sector plate voltage and will also observe a charge state 2 ion at an energy of 2E. However, ions with differing charge-states are detected at differing times after the laser pulse. This follows since an ion with twice the charge-state and twice the energy travels at a faster speed, that is, 1.414 times faster because energy is related to the square of the speed. Thus, the higher-energy ion arrives earlier. This technique which used the arrival time after the laser pulse, to analyze the detected signal, is called spectral time-of-flight analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In order to obtain the entire distribution of ions over energy and charge-state, the voltage difference on the sector plates was scanned from 0 to 10,000 volts. Each voltage difference gave a set of charge-states and energies as described above. A computer program is used to select the individual charge-states at each sector plate voltage difference and to assemble the ion energy and charge-state distributions. These distributions of ion energies and charge-states depend on the parameters of the laser pulses as defined herein. The isotope enrichment process was observed both in the ion distributions of the plume and in the spatial patterns, from the deposition and growth process, on the thin films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A typical spectrum is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> for boron nitride where the boron isotopes are shown along with the nitrogen ions. For the case of a boron nitride target, the two stable isotopes, boron 10 and boron 11, were easily observed. Their natural abundance is 19.78% and 80.22%, respectively. Relative isotopic ratios in the ablated plume are observable in these spectra as a function of ion charge state and ion energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows data obtained at a fixed voltage on the sector plates and using time of flight synchronization to build up discrete energy spectra of the individual charge states for ions in the ablation plume. Here, the signal from the MCP (micro channel plates) of the detector was plotted as the function of arrival time after the laser pulse shown in microseconds. This data was obtained under vacuum conditions. This data was obtained using pulse width of 200 femtoseconds, wavelength of 780 nanometers, repetition rate of 10 Hz, and 4 millijoules (mJ) energy per pulse using the Ti:Sapphire laser. The data of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> was captured in a vacuum by the experimental apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The intensity of the laser beam incident on the target was about 2.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>watts per square centimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and bearing in mind that the natural abundance ratio of boron 10 to 11 is on the order of 20:80, it can be seen that enrichment of a specific isotopic species within a zone of the plume is achieved. More specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows boron 10 B(10) and boron 11 B(11) at the &plus;4 charge condition captured approximately 4 microseconds after the laser pulse. Here, the occurrence of B(10) and B(11) is about the same. In other words, at the &plus;4 charge condition corresponding to 4 keV, the number of B(10) isotopes, as shown by the B(10) peak, is approximately the same as the number of B(11) isotopes. This distribution of B(10) and B(11) at the &plus;4 charge state shows an occurrence of B(10) that is 4 times more than its naturally occurring abundance with respect to B(11). Therefore, there was clearly a zone within the plume that contained an enriched fraction of B(10) with respect to B(11) as compared to the naturally occurring amount. The distribution captured for B(10) and B(11) in the &plus;1 charge state at about 1 keV, is shown in the vicinity of 8-9 microseconds after arrival of the laser pulse. In the graph at close to 9 microseconds, there is shown a peak for B(11) and close to 8 microseconds, there is shown a peak for B(10). The relative proportion of B(10) to B(11) at this segment shows that there is more B(10) relative to B(11) than the naturally occurring amount. This is even more clearly seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, where the ratio of B(11):B(10) is always less than 4:1 and often at about 1.5:1. The naturally occurring amount of B(11) to B(10) is 4 to 1(80:20). This enrichment at essentially all charge states &plus;1 to &plus;5 occurred because the aperture permitted passage of the rich B(10) part of the plume to the detector. Correspondingly, B(10) lean parts of the plume did not reach the detector. Since isotopic species were not created or destroyed in the process, it follows that there are probably zones within the plume or remaining target material which are relatively deficient in B(10) and relatively enriched in B(11). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The data of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> was obtained by sweeping the voltage on the analyzed sector plates, the charge and energy distribution data for boron as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> was integrated to produce <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also shows data for equivalent experimental conditions where a deposition chamber included nitrogen gas backfill of 0.8 m Torr (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). There are 3 sets of data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, respectively, showing B(11), B(10) and N (nitrogen). The nitrogen curves are significantly smaller in amplitude than the boron curves due to the depletion of N in the BN target from heating and ablation over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows the ion energy distributions resulting from successive spectra as obtained per <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> the peak of the &plus;1 ion energy distribution is to the extreme left followed by &plus;2, &plus;3, &plus;4, and &plus;5. B(11) is the top plot and B(10) the middle plot. Peaks from nitrogen are also given as the bottom plot of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, but are not being used to demonstrate the effect in this figure. It is anticipated that the very small concentrations of nitrogen isotopes, not desirable here, are likewise undergoing enrichment. These nitrogen peaks exist because the starting material is boron nitride and nitrogen ions were generated as well as boron ions. More specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows a plot of transverse ion density expressed in ions/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>versus ion energy expressed in keV. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> was obtained by sweeping the sector voltages on the analyzer plates resulting in the energy distributions as a function of the charge state. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the geometry of the experiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, caused capture and detection of the zone within the laser ablation plumes where the relative ratio of these isotopes (B(10) and B(11)) are drastically altered from their naturally occurring abundance, when measured as a function of charge state and energy. That is, in all cases, the ratio of B(10):B(11) was greater than that which naturally occurs, and often close to 50:50. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The results demonstrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>A were also obtained when generating a plume in the deposition chamber in the presence of a background gas of nitrogen. When the chamber contained nitrogen gas, there was a charge exchange which occurred as the boron ions gathered electrons from the nitrogen. Here, the boron ions were reduced from the higher charge states such as &plus;3, &plus;4 and &plus;5 and to the lower charge states, namely, &plus;1 and &plus;2. This is evident from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. Here, enhancement was also clearly obtainable since the ratio of B(10) to B(11) was on the order of 50:50. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> It is thought that the presence of the background gas facilitates formation of a product film containing constituents derived from the background gas and this may be desirable in forming isotope enriched zones having a particular chemical composition. It is clearly advantageous that the presence of a background constituent does not affect the process of enrichment yet permits inclusion of background gas species in a product. Therefore, by this means, materials of desired composition may be formed having the isotope enriched feature. This is demonstrated later with respect to formation of a film from the plume. It is anticipated that isotopically enriched particulates, precipitated from the plume or background gas, could also be formed. This would provide a mechanism for creating isotopically enriched nano-particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> contains results obtained from the experimental apparatus of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> but with a different laser beam. Here, laser wavelength of 1.06 microns was used; repetition rate of 10 Hz was used; and a pulse width of 6 nanoseconds was used. The pulse energy was 60 millijoules (mJ) energy per pulse corresponding to a fluence of 760 J/cm and an intensity of 1.3&times;10<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>w/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Here, the main difference in the method was the use of significantly different pulse width, namely, 6 nanoseconds as compared to the prior 200 femtoseconds. The experiment was conducted both in a vacuum and in the presence of nitrogen background gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The experimental set up used to obtain data of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> included the directing of the plume through an aperture as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Therefore, the data of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> also shows capture and detection of the B(10) enriched central portion (cone) of the plume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows transverse ion density of the plume captured in the enriched zone as a function of energy level. The results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are both for the case of the vacuum and the case where nitrogen background gas is contained in the deposition chamber. It is observed that generally the transverse boron ion density in the 6 nanosecond case is less than the 200 femtosecond case. In other words, there is less dense plasma plume generated under the laser operating parameters defined here at 6 nanoseconds pulse width. Relative enrichment is still obtainable. In other words, there is enrichment of B(10) with respect to B(11) as compared to that which is naturally occurring. The overwhelming conclusion to be drawn from the data is that enrichment has clearly occurred. The effect of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>background gas in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> was similar to that observed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. Therefore, the overall conclusion to be drawn from the data presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is that the relative ratio of the isotopes, in these ablation plumes, are drastically different from that observed for the naturally occurring species as reported in standard references. More specifically, the experimental set-up shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> contains the apertures having four millimeter (mm) holes. The aperture guided the plume into the detector and also acted as a way of isolating the high pressure zone of the chamber from the low pressure (vacuum) zone. Since the plume was generated in a vacuum chamber, apertures help in maintaining the relative vacuum. As a consequence of this set-up, the aperture essentially permitted passage through of that portion of the plume which contained the relatively high proportion of B(10) as compared to B(11). Therefore, all of the data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> show a relatively enriched B(10) portion of the plume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show the isotope enhancement effect for a picosecond laser pulse. The energy and charge state distribution of the ions are shown from a BN plume. The plume was generated with a 780 nanometer, 230 picosecond laser pulse with an intensity of 2.8&times;10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>Watts/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is for a plume in vacuum, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> is for the same plume in a background of 0.8 milliTorr of N2 gas. Charge state &plus;3 in the vacuum case and charge state &plus;1 in the N2 case show a very strong enhancement of B(10) over B(11). This demonstrates the dependence of the isotope effect on ion charge state and ion energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The dependence of the isotope enhancement on ion charge state, ion energy and laser pulse duration is summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The calculation of the B(10) to B(11) ratio for the data from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, 5A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-C, respectively. The naturally occurring ratio is 0.25 and is shown as the dotted line in each graph. The femtosecond case in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows a strong enhancement of B(10) over B(11) for charge states &plus;1 to &plus;5, particularly for &plus;3, &plus;4, and &plus;5. The enhancement is present for nearly the entire range of the ion energies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The isotope enhancement was also measured for gallium which has naturally-occurring isotopes with masses of 69 and 71 amu with an abundance of 60.4% Ga69 and 39.6% Ga71. Enrichment of the lighter isotope was also observed for this material using the experimental set-up of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in the same manner as for boron nitride. The time-of-flight spectrum from a GaN (gallium nitride) ablation plume in vacuum is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The laser pulse was 150 femtoseconds, 780 nanometers, and 2.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>13 </superscript></highlight>Watts/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In charge states &plus;1 to &plus;3, Ga69 and Ga71 are present, with ratios clearly greater than the naturally-occurring ratio of 1.53. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The time-of-flight spectra are compiled in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> for the same laser pulse described for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> shows the ion charge state and energy distribution in vacuum and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows the case in 0.8 milliTorr N2 background gas. Once again, the enhancement of the lighter isotope, Ga69, over the heavier, Ga71, above the naturally-occurring abundance is clear for the different charge states and energies. </paragraph>

The naturally occurring ratio 1.53 is shown as dotted lines in the figures. The enhancement of the lighter isotope, Ga69, over the heavier one, Ga71, follows the same trend as the boron case for B(10) and B(11). The effect is generally stronger here for gallium than that shown for boron in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The effect observed in the time of flight ablation plume coming from the ablated target is useful for preparing film products. This is accomplished by directing the plume toward a substrate in an experimental arrangement as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. As shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the plume condenses to form a thin film on the surface of the substrate. The film was enriched in the preferential isotope ratios as observed earlier and as demonstrated by FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The following film experiments were designed to capture essentially the entire cross section of the plume. By this means, zones rich and lean in B(10) as compared to the natural abundance were clearly observed and verified. More specifically, it is believed that isotopes are neither created nor destroyed in the process, therefore, it is assumed that the composition of the plume or remaining affected target material, in total, represent natural occurrence of the B(10) and B(11) isotopes. This is further illustrated by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a schematic showing the plume coming off of the target. The plume has a relatively B(10) enriched conical section (zone) and a relatively lesser B(10) zone on either side of the concentrated zone. These lesser concentration zones maybe B(11) depleted. In order to further understand and verify the relative proportions of the isotopes in the entirety of the plume, films were formed in the deposition chamber in a manner which captured essentially the entire cross-section of the plume. This entire cross-section encompassed a relatively B(10)-rich central conical section as well as surrounding zones having relatively less B(10) or being B(10) depleted. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows an experimental set-up very much similar to the experimental set-up of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> except that the plume generated from the target is directed to a substrate to form a film thereon. No apertures are used to screen out any portion of the plume or film. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the laser generates a pulse of 150-200 femtoseconds, 780 nanometers, and 10 Hz with an energy per pulse of 4 mJ-100 mJ. The laser beams are directed through a focusing device onto the target. In this example, the target is boron nitride. A plume of laser plasma is generated containing ionized particles of boron, nitrogen, and also electrons, some neutrals, and likely some excited atoms and molecules. The plume is directed onto a 2-inch diameter silicon substrate where the film is formed. Optionally, the substrate holder may be cooled by liquid nitrogen to a temperature on the order of 77&deg; K. if desired to affect the condensation and morphology of the formed film. Substrate temperatures elevated above room temperature are also possible up to 1000&deg; C. The electrostatic analyzer (charge state and energy analyzer) is also shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The silicon substrate had a thickness on the order of 400 microns and boron nitride films were deposited thereon having a thickness of approximately 0.1 microns. Once the system had been set-up, aligned and calibrated, films were produced from the plasma in a relatively short time frame on the order of about 15 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The results of the deposition process are shown in Table I and corresponding graphs of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference>. Table I contains as a first entry, a listing of the relative abundance in nature of B(11) and B(10). The natural occurring ratio of B(11):B(10) is about 4:1. The data entry designated as BN3169906 (&minus;906) was taken from a relatively thin zone of the film. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the film thickness decreases from the center toward the outer edge of the substrate. An analysis of this thin part of the film, based on Rutherford ion beam analysis, shows the counts for B(10) and B(11). The ratio of B(11) to B(10) at the &minus;906 data point is relatively rich in B(11) (i.e., depleted in B(10)). Here, the amount of B(10) is on the order of 17% whereas its naturally occurring amount is close to 20%. The amount of B(11) in the &minus;906 sample is close to 82%, whereas its naturally occurring amount is about 80%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Samples 3169907 (&minus;907) and 3169908 (&minus;908) were taken from portions of the film designated as thick and near the center of the substrate. This is also schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. In the &minus;907 sample, B(10) was on the order of 30% and B(11) on the order of 70%. Here it is clearly seen that the amount of B(10) isotope present in this zone of the film is very much greater than the naturally occurring amount which is about 20%. Sample &minus;908 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) confirms the results found in sample &minus;907. In sample &minus;908, isotope B(10) was present in an amount close to 35% based on the sample count of B(10) by the Rutherford scattering method, and B(11) count was on the order of 65%. Here it can be seen that the amount of B(10) is very highly enriched as compared to its naturally occurring amount with respect to B(11). Referring back to curve 6 of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, (sample &minus;906 taken from the thin portion of the film) it is possible to subtract out the effect of the silicon substrate by virtue of the line, and look above the line for the peak in the vicinity of channel 200 which shows B(10) in a relatively small proportion for curve 6. The proportion of B(10) in the thick portion of the film is the upper curve labeled curve 7. Here the proportion of B(10) is greater than that which naturally occurs. B(11) peak is shown closer to the channel 300 on the curves. Overall, it can be seen that the proportion of B(11) to B(10) in curve <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is higher than the proportion of B(11) to B(10) in curve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> contains results corresponding to sample &minus;908. Sample &minus;908 was taken near the relatively thick center of the film. B(10) is shown as a peak in the vicinity of channel 200 and B(11) is shown in the vicinity of channel 300. Here the proportion of B(10) is higher than either of the samples &minus;907 or &minus;906. It should be noted that the peak near the channel 400 of the X axis of all the curves corresponds to nitrogen. In all cases, the baseline represents the silicon substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The BN film was analyzed by Rutherford backscattering (RBS) at 5 spots of 3 mm size over a range of 1&Prime;, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>. The RBS spectrum was fit using the commercially-available computer program RUMP. The silicon background was subtracted out and the B(10) to B(11) ratio was fit as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14B and 14C</cross-reference> for different spots on the film. The thickest region of the film was sampled at spot (1) which corresponds to the deposition from the central part of the plume. The thinnest region of the film was sampled at spot (5) which corresponds to the outer part of the plume. The B(10)/B(11) ratio is maximum for the film captured from the plume center and decreases toward the naturally-occurring ratio away from the center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The experimental set-up of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> was used in further experiments, using the method applied to boron and gallium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The method applied to boron and gallium produced measured factors greater than 2 for isotopic enrichment in the multiple-charge-state ions from ultrafast laser ablation plasmas. Such methods applied to the elements Zn, Ti, and Cu produced results which confirm the enrichment of the lighter isotope on the target-normal axis of the expanding ablation plume (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). Angular scans of these plumes for boron demonstrated the persistence of the enrichment effect to wide angle, being present as far out as 45 degrees from the normal direction (central axis). Systematic variations in the dominant ion species and their energy distributions, as a function of charge state, are observed in these angular scans (see for example <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Deposition of isotopically-enriched thin films appear to be strongly influenced by the ratio of ionic to neutral-atom species in the plasma. The data here demonstrate a relationship between the ion to neutral atom ratios in the plumes and the laser operating parameters. A variety of techniques were employed to show such ratios as a function of laser operating parameters, including deflected versus non-deflected neutral species in the ion energy analyzer, laser probe deflection in the refractive portion of the ablation plasma, emission spectroscopy, and Langmuir probe measurements. In general, the neutral species were observed to have several factors of 10 lower energies than the ions. Likewise, the data indicates that laser operating parameters are used and adjusted to maximize or minimize the ionic to neutral specie ratios in the plume. It is thought that secondary laser pulses which act as plasma pumping pulses could significantly change the ion to neutron ratio and thereby provide greater enrichment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the isotopic ratios of several elements from the periodic table, as a function of charge state, as observed in ultrafast laser ablation plasmas. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> are the results of an angular scan showing the variation in energy distribution, as a function of angle from normal for moderate-intensity ablation (5&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). These results are consistent with the model of a plasma centrifuge for separation of ions according to kinetic energy. This plasma centrifuge is thought to be controlled by the longitudinal magnetic field of the laser ablation plasma. It is thought that the expanding plasma produces a strong magnetic field that provides a rotational component to the ions as they explode (expand) away from the ablating surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> These results demonstrate a kinetic energy separation for the ion energy distributions as a function of observation angle relative to the target normal. Such kinetic energies are proportional to the first power of the mass and second power in velocity (K.E.&equals;&frac12; mv<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), thus confirming the presence of lower mass ions (with lower velocity) near the zero (or central) axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> for the various elements are consistent with the results obtained for boron. Returning to the data for boron, Table II shows the integrated areas under each of the charge-state curves presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The ratios of these areas are also presented which provides a measure of the total isotope enrichment associated with each charge state of boron. An interesting pattern is seen in the case of vacuum ablation where charge state &plus;3 has the largest (nearly 1:1) ratio of the light to heavy isotope. This is followed by charge state &plus;4 which has the next most highly-enriched condition. It is also observed that the highest total yield of ions is for the &plus;4 charge state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In summary, the invention provides an isotopic enrichment process in laser ablation plumes. This effect was demonstrated in the ion energy spectra of laser ablated boron nitride and gallium nitride materials. The effect was first observed using 150-200 femtosecond pulses and has also been seen using 200 picosecond and 6 nanosecond pulses. It appears to be more pronounced in the short pulse case (fs) but is also clearly observable in the longer pulse case (ns). The manifestation of this effect occurs in the yields obtained for the boron 10 compared to boron 11, as well as for gallium 69 versus gallium 71. These isotopes are present in the ionically charged species of the laser ablation plume. The naturally occurring abundance of boron 10 to boron 11 is 19.78% to 80.22%, nominally 20/80 ratio. In the ion energy spectra reported for the enriched zone of the plume, as a function of ion-charge state and ion energy, there are ratios that are greater than 50/50 and in most circumstances always greater than the naturally occurring 20/80 ratio. These differences seem to vary with ion charge state, ion energy and laser pulse duration. In addition, the isotope enrichment is generally larger for gallium, which suggests an important dependence on the target mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the systems described herein, the laser pulse was focused to the surface of the ablation target and the ablation plume left the surface of the target approximately in a normal direction expanding into the region surrounding it. This region constituted a high vacuum or an enclosure containing a dilute background gas. The particles in the plume consisted of electrons, ions, and neutral atoms or molecules. These neutrals may or may not be in excited states. The plume was captured so as to provide zones containing isotope distribution different from the natural abundance. The results, as presented above, are unusual and unexpected. This is because isotope separation, as a process, is normally done by taking advantage of known features such as mass diffusion or difference in atomic vibrational modes. The process described herein is completely different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> While not wishing to be held to any particular theory, one possible explanation for the effect could be found in the nature of atomic collisions for large backward angles in the present case. The laser ablation process is produced when the laser beam is absorbed by the material at its surface resulting in an intensely ionized and very dense plasma. This plasma expands outward away from the surface and inward at the same time. The inward going portion is reflected by the solid surface beneath it and is scattered back in a rearward direction reinforcing the original outward moving plasma front. For ultrafast pulses (fs and ps) the plasma at the surface will be very thin (a few hundred angstroms) and the collisions producing the backward directed motion will consist of predominantly ions that scatter at approximately 180 degrees. The observation angle for the detector is at exactly 180 degrees with, in addition, a very small acceptance angle, on the order of 0.1 degree. In reviewing the above results, several possible phenomena and properties are to be considered. They are summarized here. The effect is restricted to the first few hundred angstroms below the surface of the material. Screened coulomb collision mechanisms and other possible screened potentials seem to pertain. Mass differences play an important role in the process. Shallow angle collisions just prior to the main ultra-low impact parameter backscattering event seem to be relevant to the process. Recoil of the target nucleus seem to be a factor in the enhancement. The angular width of the effect varies with ion energy, charge state and target mass. The effective depth over which the process occurs is a function of ion mass and energy and the target mass. In addition, variations in the plasma distribution can produce a type of electromagnetic lens which selects and focuses ions according to charge state and energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a filtering effect can be based upon collisional filtering or electromagnetic filtering. It is clear that the plasma plume has an angular distribution pattern with the central cone preferential with the lighter isotope. This is thought to be because when the plume comes off the target, there is an angular distribution pattern for the isotopic species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> All of these parameters seem to be important when comparing light and heavy isotopes that are involved in a wide angle 180 degree scattering event. By using scaling, it is expected that the angular width of the effect observed here will be on the order of 8 to 10 degrees from the surface normal. This will result in an isotopically enriched circular zone of about 1 centimeter radius near the center of the deposited film, if that film is deposited at a typical 7.5 centimeters away from the ablation source. At one meter from the ablation source the angular width will produce a circular zone of enrichment that is on the order of 14 centimeters in radius. It is evident that this process is adaptable to commercial scale-up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As stated above, data was collected for the 6 nanosecond pulse duration, 150 to 200 femtosecond pulse duration, and also for an intermediate pulse duration of 230 picoseconds. With gallium, the effect at 230 picoseconds appears to be diminished relative to the 150 femtosecond case. With boron, there is no clear trend in B(10)/B(11) ratios from 200 femtoseconds to 230 picoseconds to 6 nanoseconds. In particular, there is a charge state dependent isotope enhancement for certain conditions, shown most strongly in the &plus;3 charge state of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. However, the total yield is decreased in the nanosecond case, relative to the picosecond and femtosecond cases. The gallium and boron data suggests that there is a relative optimum pulse duration for obtaining the ablation effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As a result there is a very thin layer on the order of 200 angstroms where the process occurs, the correlated collisions occur within a very shallow depth. This enhancement or optimization of the backscattering mode seems to be dependent on the mass, energy and charge. It appears that the cone in which the effect occurs is dependent on the mass of the scattering atoms. The heavier the mass of the scattering atoms, the bigger the cone. Conversely, the lighter the mass of the scattering atoms, the smaller the cone. From the data obtained in the B(10) and B(11) relationship, it appears to show that the mass effect is there and the charge effect is there. The screen charge appears to be related to why the different charge states provide different isotopic ratios. Therefore, the data clearly suggests there is a mass dependence in the scattering and a charge dependence in the scattering and the width of the cone is controlled by that. Both of these dependencies namely charge and mass are observed in this work. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Backscattering as used herein designates traveling of particles in a direction opposite to that of the path of the energy. In this case, backscattering is not related to the angle of incidence of the laser. In contrast, backscattering as defined herein is the reaction of the particles to the movement of the plasma in a direction into the material. This effect is the result of the formation of the plasma after the laser pulse has delivered its energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> It is thought that pulse width on the order of hundreds of picoseconds or less, which cause ablation in plasma formation while minimizing thermal effects, are preferred. This generates a relatively dense plasma from which the ions expand. There may be a slight material dependence with respect to the preferred pulse duration or pulse width. Methods for generating short pulses such as 200 ps or less or 10 ps or less are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,186. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> It is not fully known from the present experiments if the process is significantly wavelength dependent. Preliminary experiments suggest the effect is very small, or may not be present, for 353 nm (i.e., near UV). The work was done in the near IR at about 1 micron. There could be useful results for the near UV wavelength range since it is known that such laser pulses, even when relatively long and in the nanosecond range, are absorbed over a very thin layer of only a few hundred angstroms. It is therefore thought that the process of the invention is workable in the ultraviolet wavelength range with longer (nanosecond) pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Therefore, wavelength on the order of 198 nanometers (nm) to 2.5 microns is thought to be useful along with pulse widths on the order of nanosecond to femtosecond with energy fluences in the range of millijoules/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to hundreds of joules/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>or more, and intensities on the order of 10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>watts/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Extreme relativistic electron effects become significant above 10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>watts/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and could provide new processes relating to the herein observed isotope enrichments. It is thought that the preferred range is 0.8 micron wavelength with 100 femtosecond pulses at 10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>watts/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>laser intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the case of femtosecond short pulses, the absorption depth of the energy is relatively shallow. In the case of a relatively long wavelength, there may be a trade-off between a relatively deep absorption depth and the length of the pulse. For example, a longer pulse at a longer wavelength is thought to affect a greater depth of material and the isotope enrichment effect may be less as per the data in the 6 nanosecond case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The process does not have to be done in a vacuum, however that is the cleanest way to get a film. It could be done in a background gas (as shown earlier) and even conceivably in air. Doing this in air (or other gas at atmosphere, or above) could, in fact, be an interesting way to make isotopically enriched particulates. The size of these could be controlled by the gas pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> It is not thought that repetition rate of the laser plays an important role except that the growth rate of the film will be affected thereby. The energy level of the laser is important and it is desired to ablate material and form the plume without residual thermal effects into a substantial bulk of the ablated material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Energetic ions have a very wide range of initial energies and charge states in the laser ablation plasma. As such, they represent a very rich source of diagnostic probe particles. Appropriate detectors can examine spatial and energy distributions of various charge states in order to understand phenomena taking place within the ablation plasma. Experimental results herein show how such swift ionic charge states are affected by passage out of the ablation plume and what effect occurs as a function of observation angle about the normal to the ablating surface. These experiments make it clear that observing energetic ions as a function of energy, mass, and spatial (angular) distribution represents a rich source of information. Such data provides valuable information on the force fields affecting these ions beyond conventional fluid dynamic forces and hydrodynamic processes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows an example of such measurement where the effects of laser wavelength and pulse duration are examined relative to isotopic mass ratio analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Interesting variations of isotopic ratios are seen as a function of laser wavelength and particle charge-state. It is thought that these variations are directly related to the time development, strength, and orientation of the magnetic fields in the ablation plasma through which the swift ions pass. Ions of different charge state travel at different velocities relative to the beginning of the ablation pulse. These ions then pass through the plasma magnetic fields at different times relative to the build up and decay of the magnetic fields. Thus, such ions serve as a probe for determining the growth rate and duration of such fields. It is noteworthy that the isotopic separation of ions seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a minimum for experiments done in the UV (353 nm) compared to the IR (1.06 micron) and near IR (780 nm). This implies a wavelength dependence of the magnetic-field-generating mechanisms. The angular distribution of ejected ions as a function of charge state, energy, and mass were examined. These experiments suggest strongly that there are pronounced kinetic energy dependencies to such angular distributions. Again, this is thought to be due to the presence of magnetic fields within the plasma through which the ions penetrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows a multi-stage arrangement of laser beams and enrichment targets. The system is operable with all laser beams and targets run simultaneously or sequentially. In one embodiment, all targets are the same material, and as time goes on each target is enriched in a selected ionic species. The last target down the chain will have the greatest enrichment, due to the multiplication effect that occurs. If it is desired to achieve enrichment of the lighter isotope, then the laser is directed to the inner conical region of the deposit formed by ablation of the upstream target in the cascade arrangement. It if is desired to achieve enrichment of a heavier isotope, then the laser is directed to the annular region outside the inner conical region of the deposit formed by ablation of the upstream target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the lasers and targets are nominally the same and operation of the laser is the same, a dynamic equilibrium condition arises. Here, the rate of material added, for example, at target 2 is equal to the rate of material removed from target 1. After some desired period of operation, the last target in the chain is the most enriched with respect to a selected isotope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the irradiation of targets is conducted sequentially to provide progressively enriched films in the cascade arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Thus, an initial spatial separation of isotopes occurs by irradiating (ablating) target 1 whereby a deposit is formed having a relatively enriched region and lean region for a selected isotope. Such deposit forms the second target and one of the regions thereof is irradiated to provide further isotope separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Significantly, the isotopic enrichment is clearly observed in the ablation ion spectra and in the deposited films. The commercial implications are evident. Products having desired isotope distribution are able to be produced from the process. Multiple iterations of film formation may be used to increase the isotope concentration. The film formed in a prior iteration becomes the subsequent target to produce a desired result. Multiple deposition steps are also useable to form multi-layer films. The process and system apparatus are adaptable to commercial use and automated production. Therefore, isotope enriched products are obtainable by the methods and system of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Although not wishing to be held to a particular theory, the enrichment effects observed in this work most probably involve interaction of charged ion species in the laser plasma with intense magnetic fields formed by the laser just ahead of the plume expansion process. It is less likely that the observed effects are associated with isotope production through laser-induced nuclear reaction processes. The laser intensities used in this work (10<highlight><superscript>13 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) seem too low for such events to occur. Intensities 4 to 5 orders of magnitude greater are thought to be necessary for photo-induced (n,&ggr;) reactions to occur via optically-energized electrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> It is thought that both toroidal and axial magnetic fields are generated within laser-induced plasmas and that these fields, near the surface of the ablation target, are on the order of 0.6 MG for laser intensities around 10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The time development of the toroidal field precedes that of the axial field and in so doing provides a trans-radial impulse to the ion velocities. The presence of an axial field provides the conditions for a plasma centrifuge mechanism to operate in producing the isotope separation we observe. The intensity of both fields decreases monotonically away from the surface of the ablating target. Data demonstrates that an inverse power law decrease in the axial field occurs over distances of about 150 &mgr;m from the ablation surface. By extrapolating an initial 0.5 MG field to large distances, one can estimate the axial field strength along the path toward a deposition substrate on which the isotopically-enriched films are grown. Using a &minus;0.33 power law dependence for the axial field strength as a function of distance for a laser intensity of 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, there is obtained a spatially-averaged field strength of 44 kG across the 7 cm distance from our ablation target to the deposition substrate. Since the axial field is considered to be produced by a dynamo action within the plasma itself, one might expect that the field is retained within the plasma plume as it moves toward the deposition site. This would provide the necessary geometry for a plasma centrifuge-like condition to be established. Such a process provides a mechanism by which enrichment of the light isotope occurs on the zero radial spot of the plume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> A basic plasma centrifuge equation yields a separated enrichment ratio in terms of the radial distance from the center of an axial magnetic field: R(r)/R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;exp(&Dgr;m&ohgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>r<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/2kT), where R(r) is the ratio of the heavier to lighter ion species at radius r normalized to the ratio on axis, Ro. The enrichment depends on the isotope mass difference &Dgr;m, the angular plasma rotation rate &ohgr;, Boltzmann&apos;s constant k, and the plasma temperature T. Based on the data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, for a factor of 2 enrichment and a radial separation of enriched isotopes of 2.5 cm, there is a rotation rate of 3.3&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>rad/sec. The value of the equilibrium plasma temperature is taken as 0.5 eV and is based on typical electron temperatures measured for similar pulses in titanium using optical emission line ratios from spectroscopic emission data. Comparing the present results with the operating parameters of conventional plasma centrifuges allows for an estimate of the magnetic fields involved in the present experiments. Using this approach, the present minimum plasma rotation rate corresponds to a uniform axial magnetic field distributed over the space between the ablation target and film substrate of 4 kG. As stated above, the extrapolated spatially-averaged field across this region is 44 kG. Thus, the predicted average axial field is more than sufficient to cause the isotope separation observed in the present experiments. Accordingly, a plasma centrifuge mechanism is consistent with the results presented here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a method for measuring internal magnetic fields of laser ablation plasmas. This is a uniquely valuable scientific result, in addition to the use of the inventive technique as a simple and direct means to obtain isotopically-enriched materials. It is also useable to obtain other fundamental information about laser plasmas derivable from such observations. This includes information about ion and electron densities, internal atomic and ionic collisions, ion and electron temperatures, ion accelerating fields, and other internal electromagnetic field conditions. From a practical standpoint, the direct deposition of engineered isotopically-enriched thin films is an important advantage provided by the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> contains two graphs showing ionic (n<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>) and neutral (n<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) concentrations in a laser ablation plume formed by 100 fs pulses in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A and </cross-reference>10 ns pulses in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>B, at intensities shown in the data box. As stated in the background section of this application, it can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> that the ratio of ions to neutrals in a single ablation plasma plume is relatively small. Typically that ratio is on the order of 1% or less. To achieve a practical method for using this phenomenon as a way to harvest enriched isotopes, it would be desired to increase this ionic component to much greater levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> A single laser ablation plume is the result of a number of relatively complex processes occurring during the absorption of a laser pulse by a material and subsequent expansion of the gaseous/plasma plume. One part of this process involves the initial production of a very large percentage of ions if not complete ion content in the vapor phase plasma. In other words, the system starts out as a fully ionized electron-ion plasma. Because of the high initial density and ensuing collisions in at the early vapor/plasma stage, however, a great deal of electronic neutralization occurs as the plasma expands away from the surface of the ablating material. This highly neutralized plasma then moves through the region of the self-generated magnetic field and the ionic component undergoes the isotope enrichment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> A plasma having a density which exceeds a certain level, known as the &ldquo;critical density&rdquo;, begins to reflect optical radiation rather than absorb it. The absorption properties of a plasma normally increase with the density of free electrons in it. However, when the density reaches the critical density the plasma becomes nearly totally reflective. This limits the amount of internal energy that can be added to a plasma by a laser pulse. In most cases where an ablation plasma is formed by a laser this critical density is achieved in the early part of the laser pulse impinging on the surface of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. In this embodiment, the ionic fraction is increased by first forming the plasma by striking the target with an initial laser pulse and then allowing the dense plasma to expand. The laser pulse is selected to have an intensity and wavelength sufficient to generate a plasma comprising ionized isotopic species and to generate an internal electromagnetic accelerating field within the plasma causing spatial separation of the ionized isotopic species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The expanding plasma increases its volume thereby decreasing the plasma electron density. This allows the density of the plasma to reduce and to become equal to or less than the critical density. During the expansion process a certain degree of neutralization occurs in the plasma. This additionally reduces the free electron concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> After a pre-selected period of time elapses from the time of the initial laser pulse, that is, after the plasma is allowed to expand a desired amount, a second laser pulse is directed to strike the plasma. The time delay of the second pulse is measured relative to the initial laser pulse but is coordinated with the state of the expanding plasma. By striking the plasma with a correctly delayed second pulse, the plasma increases its absorption of additional energy and its ionic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The correct time separation between the initial pulse and the second pulse is a very important aspect of the present method. If the plasma expansion is allowed to progress too long, the plasma density becomes too low to efficiently absorb energy. If the plasma expansion is not allowed to progress long enough, the plasma density does not reduce sufficiently relative to the critical density to allow efficient absorption of energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The present method also includes a technique for identifying the time delay desired to maximize the absorption of the second pulse and to thereby improve the isotopic enrichment effect. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, plasmas of silicon are studied and the yield and average energy of the ionic component in the ablation plume as a function of time delay between the initial or originating laser pulse and the second or pumping laser pulse is shown. The energy and associated flux density in the ablation plasma are a function of the percentage of energy extracted from the incoming laser pulse at the target. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the central axis of the expanding plume is being examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows the results of measuring total ion yield and average energy in a pre-formed ablation plume generated by a 120 femtosecond (780 nm) laser pulse followed by an identical time delayed pulse. The single pulse at zero delay has an energy fluence of 2.2 kJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>on a beam spot diameter of 42 microns. The two double pulses have an energy fluence of 1.1 kJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>each. The expansion distance is based on a measured average ion velocity of 1.9&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cm/s. Time delays between 0 and 40 picoseconds are illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> It is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> that for the conditions of this particular experiment, the maximum enhancement above the single laser pulse result occurs at a time delay of between 1 and 10 picoseconds, and more particularly between 3.5 and 6.5 picoseconds, and even more particularly, at approximately 5 picoseconds. This increases the ionic yield by a factor of about 2.4 over a single pulse with twice the energy of each of the double pulses. In this example it is assumed that the plasma has expanded from a density greater than the critical density (an overdense stage) to the critical density in the intervening 5 picoseconds. At this density or below, the plasma again becomes an efficient optical absorber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it can be concluded that the onset of expansion in the plasma occurs at less than 0.50 &plus;or &minus;0.15 ps. This is because the incident laser pulse produces a dense electron-hole solid-state plasma in the time interval during the first laser pulse delivery. As a result of the high energy density in this system, a very strong, temperature dependent, electron-lattice shock coupling dominates and drives the process of converting the solid to a vapor plasma in sub-picosecond time intervals. Subsequent expansion of this plasma takes the plasma from an overdense state to a critically dense state and then to an underdense state. Critical density occurs when the laser frequency and the plasma frequency are equal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows an experiment similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> except the experiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> is for boron isotope enrichment in a pre-formed plasma. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the isotope enrichment on axis for BN ablation was initiated by a single 120-fs pulse (780 nm at 10 Hz) having an energy fluence of 2.2 kJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and compared to those initiated and pumped by two pulses of half that energy fluence (1.1 kJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) each and separated by 10 ps. The total laser intensity was 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>16 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and the natural abundance is normalized to 1. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> the normalized ratio of B<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>to B<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>is shown for the two cases, as a function of charge state. While the stated energy fluences were employed, energy fluences in a range of 10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>are preferred depending on the material selected for the target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> It can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> that the time delayed, double laser pulse method shows an enhancement of enrichment for all charge states. A time delay, in this case 10 picoseconds, results in an increase of the total ionic isotope enrichment by about 28% over that obtained with a single pulse. For a charge state of &plus;2, the improvement in enrichment is about 60%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The data illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference> confirm the concepts as stated above relating to the use of time delayed laser pulses for pumping the ionic component of a laser plasma to increase isotopic enrichment on the central axis of the plume and further to use laser pumping to increase the efficiency of isotope separation on the central axis of an ablation plume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23, a</cross-reference> second embodiment method for increasing the ionic yield even further and achieving even higher isotopic enrichment is described. In this embodiment, a plurality of sequentially time delayed laser pulses are directed at the plasma after the initial laser pulse. That is, instead of using one time delayed second or pumping laser pulse as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, multiple time delayed pumping laser pulses are employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment method of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is preferred when the second laser pulse which pumps the original plasma causes the plasma to again achieve or exceed critical density. A third pulse is then directed at the plasma, appropriately time delayed, to once again pump the plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> If the ionic yield is increased by a factor of 2 with each pump pulse and the single pulse produces a 1% ionic yield, then a 100% ionic plasma can be realized by pumping it n times where: n&equals;Ln100/Ln2&equals;6.64. Thus, by pumping the plasma between 6 and 7 times a 100% ionized condition could be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> If each time delay is on the order of 5 picoseconds, a 100% ionized condition can be accomplished in less than 40 picoseconds. With the plasma velocities being typically 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cm/sec, the total expansion distance over the 40 picosecond process time amounts to 1.4 microns. This distance is much less than the hundreds of microns over which the plasma magnetic field extends. As such, abundant time and distance exists for the magnetic separation process and associated isotopic enrichment to occur. Even if the plasma velocities became as high as 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cm/sec, the total expansion distance will not exceed 14 microns, thus continuing to be well within the distance needed to interact with the magnetic fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> It should also be appreciated that in a multiple pulse operation, the time delay between sequential pulses may be varied to yield enhanced results. In other words, it may be beneficial to delay each pulse differently. It is also possible that varying each pulse duration during the multiple pulse operation could yield enhanced results. As such, the skilled practitioner should recognized that by varying individual pulse separation delays and individual pulse durations, enhanced control over the operation may be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Chemical Separation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The above discussion concerns spatially separating isotopes by mass. An extension of this principal is chemical separation. That is, different chemicals may be separated by mass as well. However, differences in chemistry between the unlike particles may alter the separation character efficiency. Isotopes are less complex to separate in that they have identical chemical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24, a</cross-reference> graph is provided illustrating elemental enrichment of nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) as a function of angle in the ablation plume. The total enrichment ratio is shown first for each angle, followed by each of the ten charge states. The circles and solid line indicate the total enrichment ratio. The actual yield of each charge state and angle is not shown in the graph. It should be noted that the sample ratio of 45% Ni to 55% Cu was normalized to 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Nickel and copper are both metals which are next to each other on the periodic table. Nickel and copper in that regard are both metals with similar chemical properties, and thus separate in a similar way to that of isotopes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows that the lighter element (nickel) is more abundant at 0 degrees, just like the case in isotope separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating elemental enrichment of strontium (Sr) and titanium (Ti). Strontium&apos;s atomic mass is 88. Titanium&apos;s atomic mass is 48. The chemistry of strontium and titanium is quite different in the sense that they have very different electronic structure leading to very different ionic yields and velocity distributions. Thus, they do not separate in the same way as isotopes. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the heavier element (strontium) is actually more abundant at 0 degrees, in contrast to the isotope case (where the lighter isotope is more abundant at 0 degrees). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The method for conducting chemical separation is the same as for isotope separation. That is, the chemicals are separated based on mass separation in a laser ablation plume presumably by self-generated electric and magnetic fields. The only difference is the target. For Nickel/Copper, a Ni:Cu alloy target was used (45% Ni, 55% Cu). For Strontium/Titanium, a SrTiO3 target was used (strontium titanate). Even though the method is the same, because the two particles in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> have very different chemical structures, the separation character efficiency is different. In the case illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> (Sr/Ti), the efficiency is inverted compared to that of isotopes. Other chemical pairs will have varied efficiencies and may differ from that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> As stated above, the method and system apparatus used for chemical separation is essentially the same as the method and system apparatus used for isotope separation. As such, the method includes directing a laser beam onto a surface of a target. The laser beam has an intensity and wavelength sufficient to generate a plasma comprising chemical elements and to generate an internal electromagnetic scattering field within the plasma. This causes spatial separation of the chemical elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> If desired, the spatially separated chemical may be deposited on a substrate. The deposit would be formed with a first region which is relatively rich in a selected chemical element. A second region would be relatively lean in the selected chemical element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In the above method, the intensity may be in a range of about 10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>watts/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>watts/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The wavelength may be in a range of about 200 nanometers to about 10 micrometers. Further, the laser beam may comprise one or more pulses each having a duration in a range of nanoseconds to femtoseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Also if desired, an additional laser beam may be directed onto a selected one of the first and second regions at an intensity and wavelength sufficient to generate a second plasma comprising chemical elements and to generate an internal magnetic field within the second plasma. This causes spatial separation of the chemical elements of the selected region. Thereafter, the spatially separated chemical elements may be deposited on a substrate, whereby a second deposit is formed having a third region with a chemical distribution different from the selected region. This process may be repeated indefinitely to produce a highly enriched separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Enhanced Ionic Characteristics </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Femtosecond laser-pulse absorption above and below the critical density regime in ablation plasmas by means of a pair of identical collinear laser pulses separated by a few picoseconds is now discussed. The second laser-pulse modifies the ionic characteristics of the pre-formed plasma, such as ion yield, ion energy and average charge state. Maximum effects occur when the density of the initial plasma drops to just below critical density. The enhancement of ion yield is significant compared with that produced by a single pulse with twice the energy of each individual double pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Application of ultrafast lasers to materials synthesis and processing offers interesting new opportunities as compact ultrafast laser systems become more affordable and reliable. Particularly, ultrafast, micromachining, optical emission spectroscopy and pulsed-laser-deposition (PLD) are examples of potential benefits and interests since one can take advantage of the adjustable properties of ablation plumes. These plumes, and the associated plasmas, can be pre-tuned by varying laser pulse parameters such as pulse width, intensity and contrast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Interacting the initial plasma with a time-delayed second laser pulse can further modify the characteristics of an ablation plume. For example, an experimental investigation was conducted into the enhancement of ionic properties in the plasma portion of ablation plumes from a silicon target resulting from two identical 110 fs laser pulses separated by a few picoseconds. Time-resolved measurements were made of ion flux, ion energy and average charge state to verify that the ionization level and electron density condition of a plasma, initially formed by a single pulse, can be subsequently modified by the pumping action of a secondary time-delayed pulse and that critical density effects could be usefully manipulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The laser source used in this experiment was a Ti:Sapphire CPA laser system operated at 10 Hz. The laser provided 110 fs, 36 mJ laser pulses at a wavelength of 780 nm. For this experiment a single laser pulse was split into two identical pulses with a variable time delay using a Michelson interferometer. Resolution of time delay was 0.2 ps. Both pulses were p-polarized and focused collinearly on a silicon target using a 750 mm focal length lens. The incident angle was 45 degrees. The ablation target was mounted inside a vacuum chamber with starting pressure of 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>Torr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In this experimental setup, time-of-flight (TOF) ion signals can be measured using a curved sector electrostatic energy analyzer (with multi-channel plate, MCP, detector) to obtain energy distributions as a function of charge state. Alternatively, the ion flux can be allowed to proceed undeflected into a similar MCP on a straight through port of the analyzer. In the later case an undifferentiated ion flux density is obtained. The entrance of this detector system is normally located at a distance of 150 cm from the ablation target in a separate, differentially pumped, vacuum chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Total ion flux densities, from the straight through port, were obtained by time integration of the TOF signals. Energy distributions, and average ion energy, were obtained from the straight through port by converting the TOF data to kinetic energy. Ion yields as a function of charge-state were obtained using the curved-sector portion of the energy analyzer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> shows the total area density of ions in the ablation plume produced by a pair of pulses, as a function of time delay between the pulses, and the laser pulse intensity. The data points at zero delay are the result of a single pulse with twice the energy as that contained in each of the individual double pulses. It also represents the result of delivering the double pulses with zero time delay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Two effects are observed in the data of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>when the second pulse maximally interacts with the plasma formed by the initial pulse. First, the ion yield is three times higher than that produced by a single pulse. This is a result of further ionization of the plasma by the second pulse. Second, ion average energy is increased as a result of the second pulse. Ion kinetic energy is 9 keV using the double pulses separated by 5 ps compared with 6 keV using a single pulse. It is probable that these results are a consequence of the bipolar electrostatic field, responsible for ion acceleration, being sustained and reinforced by additional electrons from the second laser pulse so that ions are experiencing a stronger field for a longer period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) the maximum enhancement occurs at a 5 ps delay between the initial and subsequent pulse. This implies that 5 picoseconds are desired to allow time for sufficient expansion of the initially over-dense plasma, produced by 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, to develop and drop below critical density. Once the plasma density reaches critical density, and goes slightly below, it can again become an efficient optical absorber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Critical density is defined here in the usual way as, n<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;m&ohgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/4&pgr;e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>where n<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>is the electron density, m the electron mass, &ohgr; the laser wavelength, and e the electronic charge. For the wavelength of our experiment (780 nm), the critical density is 1.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>electrons/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. The plasma functions as a highly reflective media above this density and is absorbing just below. At a sufficiently low density the plasma becomes essentially transmissive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The absorption properties below critical density increase with electron density up to the critical point whereupon the plasma becomes reflective and absorbs inefficiently in a shallow skin depth. Based on these arguments and a self-similar expansion model for the ablation plasma an estimate can be made of the initial plasma density prior to expansion. For the plasma of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to achieve critical density in 5 ps, with a known average velocity of 1.8&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cm/sec, the plasmas initial density would have to be 6&times;10<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. This is approximately 3.5 times higher than critical density, at the wavelength being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The onset of expansion is seen to occur in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> at less than 0.5 ps. This implies a very strong coupling of laser energy to the plasma in sub-picosecond time intervals. It can be inferred from this, that as a result of the extremely high energy-density in the electronic sub-component of the plasma, a strong electron temperature-dependent shock coupling to the lattice occurs. This process results in the conversion of the solid material to a vapor-state plasma in sub-picosecond time intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Ion yields as a function of pulse separation are plotted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) using 75%, 48% and 19% of maximum laser intensity respectively. In comparing these data, the ion yield and average energy enhancement factors systematically decrease with laser intensity. This is presumably because the initial plasma densities for the higher intensities are significantly above critical density and, after sufficient expansion time, can be pumped back up to the higher ionic density and energy level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> However, those at the lower intensities are closer to the critical level and present a more tenuous plasma to the secondary pulse. In these cases, especially for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), which represents results produced by laser pulses with 19% of the maximum intensity, the initial plasma densities are probably close or below critical density. Under such circumstances, as the plasma expands the density decreases further below critical density and therefore the second laser pulse, in penetrating such a dilute plasma, has limited effects on both ion yield and ion kinetic energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> In further support of this argument, it is clearly seen, by the diagonal dashed line running from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), that less time delay is required to reach the maximum enhancement as laser intensity decreases. This peak shifting effect is considered to be a result of the initial density of the laser-produced plasmas being less at the lower laser intensities and ultimately being sufficiently low so as to approach the critical density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> If an approximately linear decrease of initial plasma density with laser intensity is assumed, the initial 6&times;10<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>density of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is reduced to 1.2&times;10 cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>at the 19% level in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. As pointed out above, this is slightly below the critical density of 1.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>21 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. The desired density therefore is between about 65% critical density to about 100% critical density. In the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the second pulse essentially penetrates the initially formed plasma at all delays and adds to the single plume density to provide a relatively constant ion flux density at all time delays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows the distribution of charge states for the single and double pulses at maximum laser intensity. The average ion charge in the plume for the case of a single pulse is 2.5 and it increases to 3.1 in the case of a double pulse with a 5 ps time delay, and 3.0 for a 10 ps delay. The inset in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows the general single mode shape of the energy distribution for the higher intensities used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> It can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> that absorption of the second pulse results in a significant increase of the higher charge state ions (&plus;5 to &plus;7) while having modest or no effect on the number of low charge state ions. The collisional-radiative equilibrium (CRE) plasma model can be used to describe such plasma ionization dynamics. This model normally shows an increase in the number of higher charge-state ions at the expense of lower charge states as the plasma temperature increases. This is not the case for the data of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The increase of average ionic charge does not occur at the expense of the low charge state ions but rather by only generating a larger number of high charge state ions. These additional contributions to the high charge states may be associated with the absorption of the second pulse predominantly in the leading edge of the expanding plasma, which is where the high-velocity high-charge state ions normally reside. One can expect resonance absorption to be in effect with p-polarized light, which is incident at a 45-degree angle, resulting in preferential absorption near the front critical surface of the expanding plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> If the laser intensity is further reduced below that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27 a</cross-reference> new and more subtle effect emerges. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> shows ion energy and ion yield in an ablation plume produced by laser pulses with 6% of maximum intensity (6&times;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>as a function of time delay. A characteristic ion energy distribution is shown in the inset of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> and consists of two components rather than the single large component shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. As shown before, the low energy component, centered at 100 eV, is relevant to the hydrodynamic expansion, while the high-energy component, centered at 1 keV, is driven by the internal bi-polar plasma electrostatic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> As shown in both FIGS. 27(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the overall (total) ion energy and yield are essentially unchanged when using single pulse or double pulse. However, when the two components (high energy and low energy) are considered separately, a significant time delayed signal enhancement is found for the lower-yield low energy component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> These results suggest that the density of the hydrodynamic component in the plasma produced with the 6% laser intensity is closer to (or above) critical density compared to that of the high-energy component. The time-delayed second laser pulses are therefore able to more effectively modify characteristics of the low energy ions. Furthermore, since the low energy component expands relatively slow, the range of time delay giving ion yield enhancement is wider than that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Since high-energy ions are dominant in the yield for the overall (total) ion distribution in terms of percentage, the total ion response does not reflect the enhancement associated only with the low energy component. The broad energy distribution of the high-energy component in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> suggests that it is more tenuous than the low energy component, which has a narrower energy distribution. In these expanding plasmas the high velocity ions spread out ahead of the low energy ones to produce a spatially distributed concentration distribution. The single mode spatial distribution of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> results from the merging of the two component bi-modal distribution for plumes generated at those higher laser intensities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In summary, double pulses separated by picoseconds effectively increase ion yield, ion kinetic energy and average charge in the plasma compared with those produced by a single pulse with twice the energy of each individual pulse. The maximum enhancement occurs whenever the plasma reaches a level close to or slightly below critical density so that it can effectively absorb the second laser pulse. The time-resolved enhancement is therefore an interesting method for performing plasma expansion processes. Furthermore, since the internal electromagnetic field can be sustained or reinforced by the second pulse, effects such as isotope separation can be enhanced using the double pulse technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> An operational approach can be envisioned where multiply sequenced pulses are used to maximize the ionic component of the plume, where the number of pulses may be on the order of 5 to 10, each one taking the plasma back to critical density in a nominal 5 ps time interval. A highly ionized plume could then be achieved in a time interval of 30 to 50 ps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Angular Distribution of Mass Enrichment for Heavy Ions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The following concerns spatial mass enrichment of chemical and isotopic ions in laser plasmas generated in ablation plumes and particularly from an alloy of Ni/Cu using ultrafast laser pulses. It is shown that ions of chemicals with neighboring masses can be enriched in these plasma plumes similar to the way in which isotopes are enriched. Comparison of angular distributions for the ratios of the elements nickel (m<highlight><subscript>Ni</subscript></highlight>&equals;58.71) and copper (m<highlight><subscript>Cu</subscript></highlight>&equals;63.54) are made with those found for similar alloy plasmas subjected to conventional plasma centrifuge processes. The results for both chemical species and nickel isotopes support a plasma centrifuge mechanism for the spatial enrichment of these heavy ions in the ablation plasma plumes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> As described above, spatial isotope enrichment for boron can be achieved on the central axis zone of an ultrafast laser ablation plume. Similar results have been demonstrated by the present inventors for a wide range of heavy ions using a variety of laser pulse durations and wavelengths. Although some preliminary data on angular distributions for boron enrichment in ablation plasmas was previously collected, its support for a plasma centrifuge mechanism was somewhat inconclusive. The following shows that such a centrifuge mechanism is rather strongly supported by direct comparison of chemical and isotopic enrichment as a function of angle about the normal to the ablation surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The chemical separation is based on examining plasmas generated from alloys of nickel and copper (Ni 45%, Cu 55%) where the average alloy mass is 61.37 mass units and the species mass difference is 4.85 mass units. In this case 6 m/m is 4.85/61.37&equals;7.9&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>. For the case of boron isotope enrichment the 6 m/m was 1/10.81&equals;9.9&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>. Since these numbers are similar, it might be expected that the alloy system would show a similar behavior to that of the boron isotopes, where now however two different chemical species are studied rather than two different isotopes of the same chemical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Going beyond the similarity in differential mass ratio, it is instructive to examine the isotopes of nickel (<highlight><superscript>58</superscript></highlight>Ni and <highlight><superscript>60</superscript></highlight>Ni), which are representative of a relatively heavy element. In this case 6 m/m is 2/58.98&equals;3.4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>which is about a factor of 3 smaller than for boron isotopes. It is instructive to examine this case since if a plasma centrifuge process is in effect, the relative spatial mass separation for nickel isotopes should be similar to that of boron, since a centrifuge mechanism is inherently independent of &dgr;m/m ratios. Most other mass separation mechanisms, and especially hydrodynamic mechanisms, tend to rapidly become ineffective as this ratio decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The angular distribution of enrichment about the normal to the ablating surface is an important physical property to be examined. If a centrifuge process is in effect, this distribution should follow the centrifuge equation in relation to angle and be conformally related to the results obtained from a conventional cylindrical centrifuge in relation to radius. The transformation between these two coordinate systems is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> where the model of the present invention is depicted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> As described above, the generation of a laser-plasma by an ultrafast laser pulse involves the absorption of laser energy by the electrons in the solid and the transfer of that energy to the atoms and ions in the material structure. This happens on a very short time scale on the order of a picosecond or so. The expansion of the ablation plasma occurs initially as a one-dimensional expansion process moving along the z-axis normal to the surface of the ablating material. The plasma converts to a three dimensional expansion process after a distance that is on the order of the laser beam spot dimension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> The isotopic and/or chemical mass separation effects are expected to take place in this one-dimensional zone. This is where the magnetic fields are the strongest and where centrifugal action can occur as a result of high-velocity ionic interaction with the magnetic fields. In fact, it can be shown that the plasma ions are able, in principle, to rotate at the cyclotron frequency in the magnetic fields of the ablation plasma where these field strengths are on the order of 100 K-gauss to 1 M-gauss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The equilibrium distribution of the ions in the one-dimensional cylindrical zone are similar to that achieved in a conventional plasma centrifuge. When the ions move into the three-dimensional expansion zone they move out of cylindrical symmetry and into angular symmetry which is characteristic of a pulsed laser plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> illustrates a coordinate transformation showing the relationship between the one-dimensional cylindrical zone of the plasma centrifuge and the three-dimensional expansion zone with the angular distribution associated with the ablation plasma. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> shows an idealized behavior for how these ions would undergo this geometric transformation process. Those ions on the central axis of the one-dimensional cylindrical zone remain on the central axis of the three-dimensional conical expansion zone, whereas the ions nearer the radial perimeter of the one-dimensional cylindrical zone expand out to the largest angles of the three-dimensional conical expansion zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The generalized centrifuge equation, valid for isotopic separation in mechanical gas centrifuges or plasma rotating devices, is given as R(r)/R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;exp(&minus;&Dgr;m&ohgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>r<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/2kT) where R(r) is the ratio of the lighter to heavier ion species at radius r normalized to the ratio on axis, R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>. The other terms in the equation are &Dgr;m, the mass difference of the species being separated; &ohgr;, the angular rotation rate of the centrifuge process; r the radius of the cylindrical zone where enrichment is being observed; k, Boltzmann&apos;s constant, and T the absolute temperature of the rotating gas or plasma. In the case of a magnetically driven plasma centrifuge, the rotation rate can be one of two distinct angular frequencies, one at the cyclotron frequency and one at a specific lower rate, proportional to the E&times;B drift rotation. Derivation and discussion of these two rigid-rotor rates is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> It is instructive to note that the enrichment process is independent of the actual mass involved and depends only on the difference in mass of the species to be separated. In the experimental arrangement used herein, the mass separation is expected to occur in the one-dimension cylindrical expansion zone. These effects are carried forward into the three-dimensional conical expansion zone. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> shows a schematic representation of this process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Mass separation, by the centrifuge process, results in an ordering/distribution of the high and low mass species along the radius of the one-dimensional cylindrical expansion zone. This ordering of rotational energy is balanced by the randomizing thermal energy kT to result in a steady state distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> In an ordinary mechanical or plasma centrifuge device, the radial ordering is observed directly at the end of the cylinder. In the illustrated embodiment, the plasma transitions from the one-dimensional cylindrical expansion zone to the three dimensional conical expansion zone a short distance from the ablation target. It is therefore necessary to map the one-dimensional radial ordering in r to a three dimensional angular distribution in </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> For this purpose, an elementary conformal mapping function is used to convert the coordinate r to the angular dimension r<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>(&THgr;/&THgr;<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>) where r<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is the maximum radius in the one dimensional zone, and is equal to the radius of the laser beam spot, and &THgr;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is the maximum angle to which r<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>maps. This maximum angle is determined from experimental observations. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> demonstrates how this transformation is effected. The angular expression for the centrifuge equation is discussed further below. Experimental angular distribution data for the Ni/Cu system, based on these concepts, are presented below. In addition, a discussion of the parameters in the angular form of the centrifuge equation is also presented as support for the magnetic centrifuge model operating in the one-dimensional expansion zone and manifesting itself in the three dimensional expansion data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> shows an ion energy density distribution for <highlight><superscript>58</superscript></highlight>Ni ions as a function of charge state. These results are similar to those found with boron as described above. The pattern in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is very characteristic of energy distributions in plasmas formed by ultrafast laser ablation plumes. The lowest charge state ions have the highest yield and lowest energies, whereas the highest charge state ions have the highest energy and lowest yields. These data are obtained from an ion energy analyzer operated in a time of flight mode. By collecting data in this fashion it is possible to extract isotopic or mass ratios as a function of ionic charge state. Examining the data in that fashion helps to understand details of the model and provides additional insight to the enrichment process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> As described above, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> illustrates the angular distribution of the ionic ratios representing the chemical mass enrichment in the ablation plasma from the alloy of Ni/Cu. The alloy ratio of 45% Ni and 55% Cu is normalized to unity and the angular scan represents either enrichment or depletion of the Ni ions relative to that of Cu. It is seen that at zero angle the ratio is increased by about a factor of 2.5 above the alloy composition and at 60 degrees the plasma is depleted by an approximately equivalent amount. The behavior illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is consistent with what would be expected from a centrifuge process as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> A direct comparison can be made between <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> and similar experiments done with a conventional plasma centrifuge. In so doing, it is observed that the enrichment using ultrafast ablation is about 2&frac14; times greater than that observed with a conventional magnetic centrifuge. This presumably is a consequence of the much higher magnetic fields available in these laser plasmas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> illustrates the angular distribution for the isotope ratio of 58Ni to 60Ni as a function of ionic charge state. The general pattern of light isotope enrichment on axis is seen in this data as well as the decrease of this enrichment with increasing angle. The solid circles and solid black line in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> shows the weighted average over all charge states for the enrichment at each of the angles measured, which were 0, 15, 30, and 60 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The isotopic ratio is seen to come back to slightly less than natural abundance at 60 degrees. The depleted <highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>8Ni ratios are presumably at the higher angles and compensate for the higher values at zero degrees in a fashion similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> An unusually high enrichment of the charge state 8 and 9 ions are seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. These ions represent a small amount of the total ionic yield and therefore do not contribute heavily to the total ionic enrichment. However, the presence of these ions suggests that some interesting physics is occurring to provide enhanced enrichment for these particular species. A similar effect was seen with boron, where charge states 3 and 4 had the highest light isotope enrichment but a low yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> illustrates the angular distribution of ionic yield as a function of charge state for the combined 58Ni and 60Ni ions. It is seen that the highest yield results from charge states 1 through 3 with a maximum near the central axis and a minimum at 60 degrees. The remainder of the higher charge state species exhibit much lower total yield at all angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 31</cross-reference> provide a set of data that can be used to evaluate the magnetic centrifuge model in relation to the model diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. It is shown here that a highly self consistent set of numerical values concerning rotation rates, magnetic field strength, and ion velocities emerge from the model and the data presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Starting with the centrifuge equation, as transformed for angular expansion, R(&THgr;)/R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;exp(&minus;&dgr;m&ohgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>r<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&THgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/&THgr;<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>kT) where all terms are defined as stated above. Inverting the centrifuge equation and solving for the rotation frequency gives: &ohgr;&equals;&lsqb;&minus;Ln&lcub;R(&THgr;)/R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&rcub;&THgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>2kT/&dgr;mr<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&THgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight>. Using values from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>; R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;2.2, R(30<highlight><superscript>0</superscript></highlight>)&equals;0.80, &THgr;<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>&equals;60<highlight><superscript>0</superscript></highlight>, and &THgr;&equals;30<highlight><superscript>0</superscript></highlight>. Taking &dgr;m&equals;4.85 mass units for the Ni/Cu system and r<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>&equals;150 microns (beam spot radius), the angular rotation rate becomes &ohgr;&equals;7.86&times;10<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>T<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight> where T is the plasma temperature in absolute degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> For the centrifuge mechanism to produce an ordering in the rotational energies of the plasma ions and therefore to achieve an appropriate spatial separation, the angular rotation rate must be large enough to balance against the randomizing motion induced by the mean temperature of the plasma. The angular rotation rate scales as the square root of the plasma temperature and must, if the separation is to continue, be driven higher by an appropriate magnetic field as the temperature of the plasma increases. This is an important concept in determining details of the plasma mechanism involved in producing the desired results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The initial temperature of a plasma, formed by pulses such as those described herein for metallic samples is on the order of 200 ev. After about 20 ns of expansion time this temperature drops to about 1 ev. In the early stages of plasma formation then, the temperature is on the order of 2.3&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>K requiring a plasma rotation rate of 1.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>rad/sec to achieve the results of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. After 20 ns of expansion this rate can be as low as 7.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>rad/sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> It is recognized here that the centrifuge equation represents a steady state plasma that executes its rotation in a rigid-rotor motion. However, for the sake of discussion, and to establish some order of magnitude sense of the physics involved, single particle motion is examined for clues as to how the process works. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> Using the basic equation for the cyclotron rotation rate <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> <highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>of a charged particle q with mass m, moving orthogonal to a magnetic field B, &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;2&pgr;qB/m, one finds, for an ion of charge state 1, a rotation rate of 9.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>rad/sec per megagauss (Mgauss) of magnetic field strength. Comparing this to the required rotation rate at the beginning of plasma formation implies the presence of a longitudinal magnetic field on the order of 1.2 Mgauss to initially drive the centrifuge mechanism. Field strengths of this magnitude are known to exist in ultrafast laser plasmas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> As the plasma expands forward, the temperature drops and the corresponding field strength drops. Public data suggest that the longitudinal magnetic field drops in an exponential like fashion with a 1/e decrease to 0.44 Mgauss occurring over an approximately 100 micron expansion distance. After 20 ns the required rotation rate implies the presence of a magnetic field on the order of 70 Kgauss. The plasma will have begun to move into the three-dimensional expansion zone by this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> To further explore the concepts of single particle motion, Larmor orbital radii for cyclotron motion are given as r<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;v/&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>where v is the orthogonal linear velocity of the charged ion. If the rotational motion is confined to occur within the laser beam diameter, corresponding to the one-dimensional expansion zone, then the linear orthogonal velocity associated with the experimental rotation rates of 1.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>rad/sec is 2.9&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cm/sec, corresponding to an average ion kinetic energy of 0.25 Kev for th elements shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. It is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> that this is approximately the mean kinetic energy measured for the charge-state one ions, which are the most abundant species, observed in the plasma. It should be mentioned however, that the data of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> are for the longitudinal velocities and are therefore only representative of the actual orthogonal velocities in the plasma. There is nonetheless good order of magnitude agreement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> It needs to be emphasized that care should be exercised concerning too great a use of the single particle model to describe the collective plasma motions discussed herein. However, a further point of interest is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference> where the isotopes of nickel appear to reveal a higher enrichment for the higher charge states, implying higher single particle rotation rates for the high charge state ions, as prescribed by the cyclotron equation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> In summary, these experiments provide data that support a magnetic centrifuge model for the ionic enrichment of light isotopes on the central axis of an ultrafast laser ablation plume. The results are similar in relation to the chemical enrichment of nickel over copper from a Ni/Cu alloy as well as for the ratios of the isotopes of 58Ni/60Ni from the nickel component of the plasma plume. The work further confirms earlier results on boron isotopes and on axis data for other heavy ions. The support for a magnetic centrifuge model is found in directly comparing ablation plasma results with the spatial enrichment data published for conventional wire wound magnetic centrifuge devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Clusters and Aggregates </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Often, small clusters or aggregates form in a laser ablation plume as the plasma expands and cools. These aggregates are not always beneficial and may be a detriment to the process. For example, such an aggregate can interfere with the isotope enrichment process by extracting atoms or ions from the plasma and not letting them participate in the enrichment process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> To prevent such aggregates from forming or to vaporize them once they form, a second laser pulse similar in nature to those described above, that is appropriately timed, can be used. The time delay required can be determined based on testing of particular target material and laser pulse interactions. The second laser pulse may be provided by a second laser but is preferably split off from the main laser pulse and delayed in time with, for example, a Michaelson interferometer. In addition, multiple sequential pulses may also be employed. In the case of aggregates, by maximizing the ionized fraction, the aggregates should automatically be minimized or eliminated with the secondary pulses.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to flow cytometry and, more specifically, to devices and methods for aligning a flow cytometry detection system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Flow cytometry is a valuable method for the analysis and isolation of biological particles such as cells and constituent molecules. As such it has a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The method utilizes a fluid stream to linearly segregate particles such that they can pass, single file, through a detection apparatus. Individual cells can be distinguished according to their location in the fluid stream and the presence of detectable markers. Thus, a flow cytometer can be used to produce a diagnostic profile of a population of biological particles. For example, flow cytometry has been used to measure the decline or maintenance of immune cells during the course of treatment for HIV infection and to determine the presence or absence of tumor cells for prognosis and diagnosis of cancer patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Isolation of biological particles has been achieved by adding a sorting or collection capability to flow cytometers. Particles in a segregated stream, detected as having one or more desired characteristics, are individually isolated from the sample stream by mechanical or electrical removal. This method of flow sorting has been used to separate sperm bearing X and Y chromosomes for animal breeding, to sort chromosomes for genetic analysis, to isolate cells bearing specific antigens and to identify new organisms from complex biological populations. Although sorting capability can slow down the rate of sample analysis by a cytometer, cell sorters can be operated at rates allowing sorting of greater than 100,000 events per second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although an operating flow cytometer can detect and sort hundreds of thousands of cells per second, a true estimate of the throughput and efficiency of the instrument must include the time and effort required to prepare the instrument before and between sample runs. Specifically, any down time experienced by the instrument must be factored into an evaluation of the instruments performance and throughput across a typical workday. For example, time spent adjusting a clinical instrument between analyses of patient samples will reduce the number of patients that can be diagnosed in a typical work day and increase the amount of time the patients and their medical practitioners must wait for a diagnosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For an instrument having the precision to detect or sort through over 100,00 events in a second, alignment of the detector must be diligently attended to. Currently, the flow cytometers used in laboratory and clinical settings require manual monitoring and alignment procedures to maintain the needed precision. Realigning a detector between sample runs can require significant time and effort even for a highly trained technician. This is time that can be costly for those operating the instrument and those relying upon its diagnosis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, there exists a need for a device which allows efficient monitoring and aligning of detector systems used in flow cytometry. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a device for determining alignment of a radiation beam in a sample detection device such as a sample detection device of a flow cytometer. The device consists of a radiation screen having a mirrored surface and one or more pin holes. The screen can be placed between a radiation source and detector to pass a properly aligned radiation beam through the pin holes while blocking stray light from contacting the detector. An advantage of the invention is that the mirrored surface can provide accurate identification of a misaligned radiation beam and its location relative to the pin hole while simultaneously providing observation of the sample and the point at which the sample is contacted by a radiation beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides an apparatus containing a detector placed to determine alignment of a radiation beam relative to the position of the sample and the position of a radiation beam directed from the sample. The accuracy with which the mirrored surface reflects the position of a radiation beam and position of the sample provides for automatation of alignment and focusing procedures. Therefore, the invention provides an automated system for aligning and focusing a radiation beam. In a particularly useful embodiment, the apparatus and automated system of the invention can be used in a flow cytometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The radiation screen having a mirrored surface and one or more pin holes can additionally contain a radiation directing device juxtaposed with one or more of the pin holes and placed to change the direction of radiation passing through the one or more pin holes. The radiation directing device being juxtaposed with a pin hole produces a fixed orientation of the redirected radiation beam relative to the location of the pin hole. An advantage of the invention is that juxtaposition of the pin hole and radiation directing device restricts the components from becoming disoriented with respect to each other so that a radiation beam entering the pin hole in proper alignment will additionally be properly aligned to the pin hole upon exit and redirection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An apparatus containing a detector placed to determine a position of a radiation beam relative to a position of a pin hole on a mirrored surface can be used in an automated system for aligning a radiation beam. An advantage of an automated system of the invention is that a feedback loop is provided for rapid and efficient beam alignment thereby providing an alternative to manual inspection and adjustment procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;radiation beam&rdquo; is intended to refer to a collection of electromagnetic waves or particles propagated in a uniform direction of propagation. The term is intended to include detectable collections of waves or particles having any energy in the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples of detectable collections of waves or particles include ultra violet (UV) radiation in the range of about 200 to 390 nm, visible (VIS) radiation in the range of about 390 to 770 nm, and infrared (IR) radiation in the range of 0.77 to 25 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;direction,&rdquo; when used in reference to a radiation beam, is intended to refer to the axis along which the radiation beam is propagated. Accordingly, the terms &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;directing,&rdquo; when used in reference to a radiation beam, refer to setting the axis along which a radiation beam is propagated. The axis along which a radiation beam is propagated can be set, for example, by aiming a radiation source, altering the angle of the axis along which a radiation beam propagates relative to a reference coordinate system such as by reflection, or collimating radiation to form a beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;alignment,&rdquo; when used in reference to a radiation beam, is intended to refer to the direction of the radiation beam relative to one or more component involved in producing, directing, or detecting radiation of the radiation beam. A relative direction of a radiation beam can be identified, for example, as a location irradiated by the beam, or a location through which the beam passes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;juxtaposed&rdquo; is intended to mean directly adjacent. The term can include direct contact by attachment mediated, for example, by adhesion or fastening. The term includes, for example, a prism directly adjacent to a pin hole due to attachment of the prism, with an adhesive compound, to a surface through which the pin hole passes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;screen&rdquo; is intended to mean any material that prohibits the passage of a photon or radiation. The material can prohibit passage of radiation based on one or more properties of the radiation including, for example, wavelength, frequency, energy, polarization, intensity, beam width or incident direction. Thus, a screen can selectively pass a portion of the radiation contacting its surface. For example, a material can prohibit passage of radiation of a specific wavelength or range of wavelengths including, for example, radiation in the visible (VIS), ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) regions of the spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;mirrored,&rdquo; when used in reference to a surface, is intended to mean a surface that is sufficiently smooth to produce an image by specular reflection of radiation in the UV, VIS or IR regions of the spectrum. Specular reflection occurs when parallel rays of incident radiation, reflected according to the laws of reflection, are reflected parallel to each other at a surface. The laws of reflection hold that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection and the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal to the rays are coplanar. Diffuse reflection occurs when parallel incident rays are not parallel when reflected at a surface according to the laws of reflection, for example, due to irregularity in the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;pin hole&rdquo; is intended to mean a cavity that extends through a screen, is surrounded on all sides by screen material and has a width, diameter or major axis of about 2 mm or less. The term includes a cavity having, for example, a width, diameter or major axis of about 1.5 mm or less, 1.2 mm or less, 1.0 mm or less, 0.8 mm or less, 0.6 mm or less, 0.4 mm or less, 0.2 mm or less, or 0.1 mm or less. The term is intended to include a cavity containing any material transparent to irradiation in the UV, VIS or IR regions of the spectrum including, for example, air, glass, or quartz. A cavity can contain a material that is selectively transparent to irradiation of a particular wavelength or wavelengths such as a filter material. A cavity included in the term can have any cross sectional shape including, for example, circular, elliptical, or square and can have uniform or non-uniform cross sectional dimensions along the axis that runs through the center of the cavity from the front to the back of the screen material. An example, of a cavity with uniform cross sectional dimensions along the axis that runs through the center of the cavity is a cylindrical pin hole. Alternatively, a cavity can have non-uniform cross sectional dimensions along the axis that runs through the cavity such as that of a conical cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;flow chamber&rdquo; is intended to mean a device that can produce or contain a sample stream such that movement of the device produces a change in the trajectory of the sample stream. A sample stream can include any mobile phase that passes particles in single file including, for example, a fluid stream or fluid jet. The term is intended to include any particle including one or more molecules. A particle including one molecule can be, for example, a fluorophore or a macromolecule such as a polynucleotide, polypeptide, or other organic or biological polymer. A particle including more than one molecule can be, for example, a cell, molecular complex or bead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;flow cytometer&rdquo; is intended to mean a device or apparatus having particles aligned in a sample stream such that the particles individually enter a zone of detection. A sample stream can include any mobile phase that passes particles in single file including, for example, a fluid stream or fluid jet. The term is intended to include any particle including one or more molecules. A particle including one molecule can be, for example, a fluorophore or a macromolecule such as a polynucleotide, polypeptide, or other organic or biological polymer. A particle including more than one molecule can be, for example, a cell, molecular complex or bead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;substantially non-orthogonal,&rdquo; when used in reference to a pin hole in a screen with a planar surface, is intended to mean an angle that would produce, a significant reflective surface at the wall of the pin hole compared to the area of the pin hole for radiation passage when the planar surface through which the pin hole passes is viewed from an orthogonal vantage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;attached,&rdquo; when used in reference to a positioning device, is intended to mean a connection of the positioning device with a second device or apparatus that allows the positioning device to alter the position of the second device or apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a radiation directing device, consisting of a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes that pass through the screen, the pin holes having an elliptical shape. An exemplary radiation directing device of the invention is represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The device shown is a pin hole mirror <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a reflective surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a pin hole through which radiation can pass <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The mirror <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, measures 18 mm by 18 mm and its reflective surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>consists of a metal layer contacting a quartz substrate. The pin hole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>passing through the mirror is elliptical shaped, the longest dimension being about 0.8 mm and the aspect ratio being about 0.75. As will be described further below, the shape, dimensions, and orientation of the pin hole and the mirrored surface can be altered for use with a variety of applications and devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes that pass through the screen provides a means to selectively pass a properly aligned radiation beam while blocking stray radiation or a misaligned radiation beam. The mirrored surface provides a second capability for the screen which is to indicate the location of a misaligned radiation beam relative to the pin hole. Therefore, the invention provides an apparatus for determining radiation beam alignment, including (a) a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes passing through the screen; and (b) a means for detecting radiation reflected by the mirrored surface, wherein the detecting means determines a position of a radiation beam relative to the pin hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An apparatus for determining radiation beam alignment is represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A radiation beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> contacts a pin hole mirror <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and either passes through the pin hole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as a beam <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or is redirected as a reflection <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from the reflective surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a direction toward an imaging device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown in the figure the apparatus can optionally contain a lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that collimates radiation <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> emitted from an optional sample <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and directs the radiation as a beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> toward the pin hole mirror, Additionally, the apparatus can optionally contain a spectrum selective filter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>&prime; that filters radiation <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> reflected by the reflective surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A side view of the optical layout is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, in which an optional collimating lens <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> collects emitted radiation <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from a sample <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to produce a collimated radiation beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which contacts the hole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the pin hole mirror <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> such that the radiation passes through the plane of the pin hole mirror as a beam <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A screen of the invention can consist of any material that is capable of substantially blocking passage of a photon and that can be coated with or otherwise attached to a reflective surface. Depending upon the material used, the screen can block photons in a particular region of the spectrum including, for example, visible, ultraviolet, or infrared regions. One skilled in the art will be able to determine an appropriate screen material for use in the invention according to the range of radiation that is desired to be blocked. Examples of materials that can block a photon include glass, metal, quartz or plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A mirrored surface of the screen can consist of any material that efficiently reflects undiffused radiation. Radiation reflected by the mirrored surface can include all or a portion of the wavelengths in a radiation beam that contact the surface. For example, a screen can reflect radiation in one region of the spectrum and absorb radiation in another region. Accordingly, the mirrored surface of a screen can selectively reflect radiation in a particular region of the spectrum that is different from the range of radiation blocked by the screen material. Examples of mirrored surfaces that can efficiently reflect undiffused radiation include, for example, polished metals, metal coated glass, metal coated quartz or plastic. Examples of metals that can form a mirror when coated on glass or quartz include aluminum, silver, platinum and gold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A mirrored surface can have any shape or orientation with respect to the direction of propagation of a radiation beam so long as a location of a radiation beam&apos;s reflection on the surface can be accurately detected and correlated with the direction of propagation for the radiation beam. Both the shape and the orientation of the mirrored surface can influence the correlation between the change in the radiation beam direction and the change in location of the reflection. For example, the distance a radiation beam reflection moves on a planar mirrored surface in response to a change in the direction of the radiation beam will depend upon the angle of the surface with respect to the direction of propagation of the radiation beam. In addition, a change in location of a reflection on a non-planar surface, such as a convex or concave surface, will have a different dependence on changes in beam direction compared to each other and compared to a planar mirrored surface when placed at similar orientations. Using well known geometric principles, one skilled in the art can select an orientation or shape for a mirrored surface that produces a desired correlation between a reflected image and the direction of a radiation beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A pin hole of the invention can have a variety of shapes including, for example, circular or elliptical. The shape of the pin hole can be such that efficient passage of an aligned beam is provided for a particular orientation of the mirrored surface with respect to the direction of beam propagation. For example, a pin hole can have an elliptical shape with dimensions that provide a circular area when the ellipse is rotated at a specified angle. An advantage of a screen with a mirrored surface and elliptical shaped hole is that the mirrored surface can be placed at an angle to reflect misaligned radiation to a detector as exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> while providing a circular area of passage for an aligned radiation beam. The resulting circular area of passage is advantageous because it provides a uniform radius within which an aligned radiation beam is confined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The orientation at which a pin hole passes through a screen can be one of a variety of angles with respect to the reflective surface. For example, a screen with a planar mirrored surface can have a pin hole oriented at a substantially non-orthogonal angle with respect to the planar surface. Accordingly, the mirrored surface can be placed at a non-orthogonal angle relative to the direction of propagation of a radiation beam such that the pin hole is oriented parallel to the direction of the beam. A parallel orientation of the pin hole can be advantageous in reducing reflection or scatter of a radiation beam at the wall of the pin hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A detector used in the invention to detect radiation reflected from a mirrored surface can be any device that converts the energy of reflected radiation into a signal in a location dependent manner. In one embodiment, a detector of the invention can be an image detection device. An image detection device of the intention includes any device that can be used to determine the location of a reflected image including for example a charged coupled device camera, video camera or a photographic camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A spectrum selective filter can be placed in the light path between the detector and mirrored surface to allow selective detection of an irradiated sample. For example, a spectrum selective filter can be placed over the lens of a detector to allow selective detection of fluorescence of a particle or Raman scatter of a carrier fluid in a flow cytometer. A spectrum selective filter used in the invention can suppress scattered irradiation for selective observation of emitted radiation. Specifically, a wavelength cut off filter which blocks radiation having a wavelength of the excitatory irradiation while allowing passage of radiation at a higher wavelength can be used to selectively block scattered radiation because scattered radiation will have the same wavelength as the excitatory radiation while emitted radiation will have a higher wavelength. One skilled in the art will be able to choose an appropriate filter according to the wavelength of the excitatory radiation, known emission wavelength, or spectrum, for a particular fluorescent molecule to be detected, and properties of the filter. Filters and their properties are known in the art and can be obtained from commercial sources including, for example, Melles Groit (Irvine, Calif.), or Oriel Corp. (Stratford, Conn.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a radiation directing device, consisting of (a) a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes passing through the screen; and (b) a means for changing the direction of propagation for radiation beams passing through the one or more pin holes, the direction changing means and the one or more pin hole being juxtaposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An exemplary radiation directing device having a juxtaposed direction changing means is represented in of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>.

The prisms are rotated at an angle &bgr; with respect to a line intersecting the three pin holes. As will be described further below, the pin holes can have a variety of separations and orientations depending upon a property of a device directing a radiation beam to contact the pin holes, the mirrored surface or the radiation beam itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The invention provides an apparatus for determining radiation beam alignment, including (a) a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes passing through the screen; (b) a means for changing the direction of propagation for radiation beams passing through the one or more pin holes, the direction changing means and the one or more pin hole being juxtaposed and (c) a means for detecting radiation reflected by the mirrored surface, wherein the detecting means determines a position of a radiation beam relative to the pin hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> represents an exemplary apparatus for determining radiation beam alignment using the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A radiation beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> contacts a pin hole mirror <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and either passes through the pin hole <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as a beam <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or is redirected as a reflection <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> from the reflective surface <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in a direction toward an optional help mirror <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The pin hole mirror is positioned at an angle &bgr; from a plane orthogonal to the propagation direction for the radiation beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> contacting the pin hole mirror.

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A radiation direction changing device of the invention can be any device that can efficiently reflect a beam of radiation. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> the device can include 2 prisms placed to redirect 2 radiation beams. In a case where 2 radiation beams pass through pin holes of a screen a single prism can be used to direct one beam or two prisms can be used to redirect both beams. Other radiation direction changing devices that can be used include, for example, one or more mirrored surface such as one of the mirrored surfaces described herein previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The angle &bgr; can be any angle that reflects a radiation beam to a detector including, for example, an angle in the range of 0&deg; to 45&deg;. An advantage of the invention is that orienting both the radiation direction changing device and mirrored surface at an angle &bgr; according to the geometric relationships described above, provides for efficient detection of a misaligned beam and maximal separation of 3 aligned radiation beams by redirecting the beams in orthogonal directions. Efficient detection and redirection of the radiation beams can occur at an angle &bgr; that produces a relatively wide angle of reflection such as an angle &bgr; greater than 20&deg;, greater than 25&deg;, greater than 30&deg;, greater than 35&deg; or greater than 40&deg;. A wide angle of reflection can be used to provide for sufficient separation of optical components. For example, in the apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, replacement of camera <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a larger device that would block beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in the orientation shown can be accommodated by tilting the pin hole mirror to increase the angle between beams <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and swinging the position of the camera out of the path of beam <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a more compact configuration can be achieved by using a more narrow &bgr; angle including, for example less than 20&deg;, less than 15&deg;, less than 10&deg;, or less than 5&deg;. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, shows incorporation of a help mirror to change the optical path such that optical components can be placed in a more compact configuration than would be possible without the help mirror. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A radiation direction changing device of the invention can be juxtaposed with a pin hole by being attached to the screen through which the pin hole passes. The radiation direction changing device can be attached by any means including, for example, a glue, adhesive, weld, solder or a fastener such as a pin, nail, or screw. Alternatively, a radiation direction changing device can be separated from a screen so as to be detached or indirectly attached by an intermediary device. As with a juxtaposed device, a radiation direction changing device that is separated from a screen can be oriented to redirect beams passing through 2 or more pin holes of a screen in orthogonal directions. Accordingly, the radiation direction changing device can be oriented at an angle &bgr; with respect to a line intersecting the pin holes as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As described above and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2 a</cross-reference> mirror containing 3 pin holes can be used for alignment of 3 radiation beams. According to the invention, a screen having a mirrored surface can be interrupted by multiple pin holes to provide alignment of multiple radiation beams. Therefore, a screen having a mirrored surface can be interrupted by 2 or more pin holes passing through the screen, 3 or more pin holes passing through the screen, 5 or more pin holes passing through the screen or 10 or more pin holes passing through the screen. Each pin hole can be aligned with a separate beam or multiple pin holes can be placed such that a relatively wide beam contacting the pin holes is partitioned into multiple beams of narrower width. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Pin holes in a screen of the invention can be separated by a distance sufficient to allow unique passage of an individual radiation beam through each hole when multiple radiation beams are directed to the screen. The distance can be determined according to the width or cross sectional diameter of a radiation beam directed to the screen such that the distance between the holes is larger than the diameter or radius of the beam cross section. Thus, pin holes can be separated by distances in the range of 0.1 to 5 mm. When radiation beams with large diameters are directed to a screen it can be advantageous to have a separation between pin holes in the screen that is in the higher end of this range or even larger including, for example, at least 1 mm, at least 2 mm, at least 4 mm or larger. Alternatively, for radiation beams having smaller diameters pin holes can be separated by at least about 0.2 mm, or at least about 0.5 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides a radiation beam aligning apparatus, including (a) a flow chamber; (b) a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes passing through the screen; (c) a means for directing radiation from the flow chamber to the screen; and (d) a means for detecting radiation reflected by the mirrored surface, wherein the detecting means determines a position of a radiation beam relative to the pin hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> An apparatus of the invention can be used to determine alignment of a radiation beam emitted from a flow chamber. A flow chamber can contain a sample stream in which emission from molecules or particles is observed when they pass a point of observation. The point of observation can be placed, for example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference> as location <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As shown in the Figures, radiation emitted at the point of observation, for example, from fluorescent particles that have been contacted with radiation of an excitatory wavelength, can be collated into a beam. The beam can be directed toward a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes such that alignment of the beam can be determined from the location of the beam reflection on the mirrored surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An apparatus of the invention can be used with a variety of flow chambers so long as radiation emitted from the flow chamber can be directed as a beam toward a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes. For example, an apparatus of the invention can be used to align a beam emitted from a flow chamber in a flow cytometer. Specifically, an apparatus of the invention can be placed in the optical path between a sample stream and detector of flow cytometer so that alignment of a radiation beam emitted from the sample stream can be determined relative to the detection device. Radiation emitted from a variety of flow chambers known in the art of flow cytometry can be aligned with an apparatus of the invention including, for example, those that contain a liquid stream in a capillary or a stream in air system as described in Shapiro, <highlight><italic>Practical flow cytometry, </italic></highlight>3<highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>Ed. Wiley-Liss, New York (1995), which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes or an apparatus of the invention incorporating the screen can be used to determine alignment of a radiation beam. The high resolution of image formation on the mirrored surface provides for accurate determination of alignment by monitoring properties of the image produced by a sample or radiation beam including, for example, focus, shape or location. Focus of a radiation beam can be determined according to the diameter, or cross sectional shape of its reflection on the mirror. Sharpness of an image reflected by the mirror can also be used to determine focus. For example, focus of a sample in a flow chamber can be determined according to the sharpness of edges in the sample as reflected on the mirrored surface. The location of a reflection of a radiation beam relative to a pin hole on the mirrored surface can be used to determine the direction at which the beam is propagated. Because the mirrored surface can reflect both the radiation beam and sample, the alignment of the beam relative to the sample can be directly observed. Thus, the alignment of the beam with the sample and with the pin hole can be determined simultaneously at a single point of observation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the invention provides a method for determining alignment of a radiation beam. The method includes the steps of: (a) directing radiation from a flow chamber to a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes passing through the screen; and (b) detecting a shape or location of the reflected radiation beam, wherein the shape or location of the reflected radiation beam indicates the intensity of radiation passing through the pin hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A location of a radiation beam reflection on a mirrored surface can be used to accurately determine the alignment of the radiation beam. For example, in a case where a radiation beam is considered aligned when it passes through a pin hole in a mirrored surface, a reflection of the beam on the mirrored surface can indicate that the beam is misaligned and the location of the reflection can be correlated with the direction of propagation for the radiation beam. In addition, the shape of a reflection for a radiation beam can indicate whether or not it is properly aligned. For example, misalignment of a radiation beam that results in the beam being out of focus can be identified as producing a reflection having a diameter that is larger than a predetermined value or having a shape that deviates from a desired shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides a method for improving alignment of a radiation beam. The method includes the steps of: (a) directing radiation from a flow chamber to a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes passing through the screen, wherein the radiation is directed by a means for directing radiation; (b) detecting a shape or location of the reflected radiation beam, wherein the shape or location of the reflected radiation beam indicates the intensity of radiation passing through the pin hole; (c) adjusting the radiation directing means from a first position to a second position, wherein radiation directed from the second position passes higher intensity radiation through the pin hole compared to radiation directed from the first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A radiation directing means can be adjusted by any movement that increases the intensity of radiation passing through a pin hole including, for example, rotation, transfer to a new position or both. Such adjustments can result in a changed direction of radiation beam propagation or a change in the focus of the radiation beam. The adjustment can be made manually or by an automated system as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The methods of the invention for improving alignment of a radiation beam can include a step of adjusting any apparatus or device that influences the direction of propagation of a radiation beam prior to passing through a pin hole in a mirrored surface. For example, a radiation beam can be aligned in the methods of the invention by adjusting the source of the radiation, a sample contacted by the radiation, a chamber that produces or contains a sample or sample stream such as a flow chamber, or any radiation directing device through which radiation passes prior to contacting the mirrored surface or pin hole. Accordingly, the invention provides a method for improving alignment of a radiation beam. The method includes the steps of: (a) directing radiation from a flow chamber to a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes passing through the screen; (b) detecting a shape or location of the reflected radiation beam, wherein the shape or location of the reflected radiation beam indicates the intensity of radiation passing through the pin hole; (c) adjusting the flow chamber from a first position to a second position, wherein radiation directed from the flow chamber in the second position passes higher intensity radiation through the pin hole compared to radiation directed from the first position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The high degree of accuracy with which alignment and focus can be determined by the apparatus of the invention allows automation of focusing and alignment methods with an automated system. Accordingly, the intention provides an automated system for aligning a radiation beam, consisting of (a) a screen having a mirrored surface interrupted by one or more pin holes passing through the screen; (b) a means for directing a radiation beam to the screen, the directing means optionally attached to a positioning device; (c) a means for detecting radiation reflected by the mirrored surface, wherein the detecting means determines a position of a radiation beam relative to the pin hole; and (d) a computer systems controlling movement of the positioning device by receiving a signal from said detection means and sending a processed output signal to said positioning device, wherein said output signal directs the movement of the positioning device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> An automated system for aligning a radiation beam can include an autocentering algorithm. Autocentering algorithms are known in the art and are commonly used in microscopes to determine the location of a specimen on a microscope stage and to move the stage such that the specimen is properly aligned with an objective lens for observation. Similarly, an autocentering algorithm can be used to detect the location of a radiation beam reflection on a mirrored surface and to move a device directing the radiation such that the beam is directed to a pin hole on the surface. As described above, alignment can also be determined from the focus of a radiation beam or sample image on a mirrored surface. Thus, an automated system can include an autofocus algorithm known in the art such as those used in microscopes and photographic cameras. Accordingly, sharpness of an edge or size or shape of a reflection from a radiation beam or sample stream can be detected and the position of a radiation beam directing device or flow chamber adjusted until the image is properly focused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Thus, an automated system for aligning a radiation beam can further include a flow chamber, the flow chamber being optionally attached to a positioning device. For example, a nozzle through which a sample stream is directed can be attached to a positioning device such that movement of the nozzle alters the trajectory of the sample stream. The trajectory of the sample stream can be monitored from its reflection on a mirrored surface and the nozzle position adjusted until the reflection of the sample stream is focused or aligned according to the criteria described above. An automated system for aligning a radiation beam can further include a means for directing radiation from a radiation source to a flow chamber, the radiation directing means optionally attached to a positioning device. For example, a lens can be used to focus a radiation beam on a sample. The position of the lens can be adjusted and the reflection of the radiation beam monitored to achieve a desired focus or alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described with reference to the examples provided above, it should be understood that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is limited only by the claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic systems are flow systems miniaturized to dimensions as small as a few, micrometers (&mgr;m). Such systems present challenges in both their design and manufacture. For example, at the level of miniaturization of typical microfluidic systems, normal fluid flow principles may be less significant than surface tension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Recent developments in microfluidic systems have been motivated in large part by the possibility of fabricating compact, integrated devices for analytical functions such as genomic analysis, diagnosis and sensing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a microfluidic system. &ldquo;Microfluidic system,&rdquo; as used herein, refers to a device, apparatus or system including at least one fluid path having a cross-sectional dimension of less than 1 millimeter (mm). &ldquo;Fluid path,&rdquo; as used herein, refers to any channel, tube, pipe or pathway through which a fluid, such as a liquid or a gas, may pass. &ldquo;Cross-sectional dimension,&rdquo; as used herein, refers to the shortest distance that may be measured between any two opposed sides of a fluid path. However, in certain preferred embodiments, the longest distance that may be measured between any two opposed sides of a fluid path is also less than the maximum cross-section for that embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the microfluidic system includes a fluid path, an inlet to the fluid path, an outlet to the fluid path and a first closing member disposed along the fluid path between the inlet and the outlet. As used herein, &ldquo;closing member&rdquo; refers to any structure specifically adapted to selectively inhibit or prevent the flow of fluid through a fluid path or between fluid paths, reservoirs, and the like. Such a closing member has an open position and a closed position and may move between these positions (either from open to closed or closed to open) at least once. This definition specifically excludes structures, such a relatively thin wall between fluid paths, that are not intended to have open and closed positions, but that may be opened or closed under some circumstances, such as the application of a relatively high pressure. The microfluidic system according to this embodiment may be constructed to function as a valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures, and, in particular, to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, an embodiment of a microfluidic system that may be constructed to be suitable for use as a valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be described. This embodiment of a microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed along fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Typically, in operation of valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a fluid is introduced, for example by pumping, into fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Following introduction, the fluid flows through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a first direction toward outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, passing closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. However, if fluid flow changes direction, for example due to a cessation of pumping, fluid is inhibited from flowing through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> due to the action of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which at least partially blocks its path. The action of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be better understood with reference to the construction of valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner and of any materials that allow a fluid to flow through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without adversely affecting or being affected by the fluid. For example, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may have any configuration or cross-sectional dimension that allows passage of a fluid or fluids to be used with microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at an acceptable pressure drop. Preferably, the cross-sectional dimension is as small as possible without inhibiting the flow of the fluid or fluids to be used with microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may have a cross-sectional dimension of less than 1 mm, preferably less than 500 &mgr;m, more preferably less than 300 &mgr;m, still more preferably less than 100 &mgr;m and, most preferably, less that 50 &mgr;cm. However, it should be recognized that the preferred cross-section dimension of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will vary with the fluid or fluids. For example, fluids, such as blood, including cells therein may suffer damage to the cells if the cross-sectional dimension is too small. As a further example, fluids having a relatively high viscosity may require excessive pumping pressure if the cross-sectional dimension is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The preferred configuration of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may vary with microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and fluid or fluids to be used therein. Generally, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferred to be as straight and direct as possible to minimize pressure drop and reduce damage to time sensitive or shear sensitive liquids. However, in some instances, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be preferred to be longer or more convoluted than necessary, such as where fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> serves as a reactor or mixer wherein a residence time is desired. Fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may have any cross-section suitable for use with the desired fluid or fluids. For example, the cross-section of fluid path <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be polygonal, ovoid or of odd or irregular shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner that allows fluid to be introduced into fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be a port, slit, funnel or other opening. Inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be adapted to mate with an additional fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, pump or other device to facilitate the introduction of fluid into fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Similarly, outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner that allows fluid to exit fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be a port, slit or other opening. Outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may also be adapted to mate with an additional fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, pump or other device to facilitate passage of fluid from microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the additional fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, pump or other device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed of any material or materials that will not adversely affect or be affected by fluid flowing through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed of a material that is chemically inert in the presence of fluids to be used within fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed of a single material that is cheap, durable and easy to work with, facilitating field use and cost effective disposability. For example, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed of a polymeric material. Where fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed of a polymer, the polymer may be selected based, for example, on its compatibility with the fluids to be used, its durability and shelf life, its cost and its ease of use. Preferably, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed from poly(dimethlsiloxane) (&ldquo;PDMS&rdquo;). PDMS is a relatively inexpensive, durable, elastomeric polymer. Because PDMS is stable, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and other portions of microfluidic systems constructed of PDMS may have a shelf life of 6 months or more. PDMS is also relatively easy to work with. It should be understood that while polymeric materials, and particularly PDMS, are preferred for the construction of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, other materials, including conventional silicon chip materials, may be used to construct some or all portions of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Other suitable materials include polymers described as suitable for use in fabricating a stamp in U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,131, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner and of any material or materials that allow it to selectively permit or inhibit fluid flow. One typical criteria for selecting whether to permit or inhibit fluid flow is fluid flow direction. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may permit fluid flow in a first direction and inhibit fluid flow in a second direction as described previously. This type of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is referred to as a check valve. Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> functions as a check valve, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner such that it is opened by fluid flow in a first direction, and/or closed by fluid flow in a second direction. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed such that it is pushed open by fluid flow in a first direction or pushed closed by fluid flow in a second direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Preferably, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> opens and closes without sliding against any portion of the microfluidic system as this may cause failure of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> due to mechanical damage or being caught in an open or closed position. Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is constructed such that it slides against any portion of the microfluidic system, some manner of reducing the friction between closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the portion of the microfluidic system may be employed. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16, 17</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the surfaces in contact with one another may be non-stick surfaces or may be treated with a suitable lubricant, such as petroleum jelly (illustrated by the shaded regions of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, such as those illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a flexible member. Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a flexible member, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner that allows closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be opened and closed as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in some embodiments, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a flap. By flap it is meant a generally planar structure attached to a base, such that the structure may move relative to the base. Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a flap it may be constructed in any manner that allows it to permit fluid to flow past closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a first direction, but inhibits fluid flow in a second direction. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed such that it covers fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when closed. Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> covers fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be constructed such that closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is allowed to move in a first direction so that it does not cover fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is inhibited from moving in a second direction by the shape of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may cover a relatively narrow portion of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as a seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and reside in a relatively large portion of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as illustrated by flow indicator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the lower portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, fluid moving through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a first direction may push closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the relatively large portion and into an open position. Conversely, as illustrated by flow indicator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the upper portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, fluid moving through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a second direction may not push closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> past seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and, thus, cannot open it, rather, fluid pressure in the second direction acts to seal closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a closed position, reducing the possibility of leakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Instead of being a single flap, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may consist of two or more flaps. In some embodiments, such flaps, rather than closing against seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, may close against one another. Such a closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are open on their upper side for purposes of illustration. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is modeled after a lymphatic valve, such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. When fluid flows in a first direction, as indicated by flow indicator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the flaps of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are pushed apart, opening closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Conversely, when fluid flows in a second direction, as indicated by flow indicator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the flaps of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are pushed against one another, closing and sealing closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In a valve having two closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that close against one another, such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be attached to fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in any manner allowing them to permit flow of fluid in a first direction and to inhibit flow of fluid in a second direction. For example, closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be connected to the sides, top and/or bottom of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> have sufficient freedom of movement to effectively come together to inhibit back flow, but not so much freedom that they are easily bent over, twisted, or pushed aside by fluid flow. In one embodiment, closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are connected to fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> only at the sides of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Where specific versions of this embodiment allow closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to twist or fall over with flow, another point of connection may be used, such as the top or bottom of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a flap, it may be constructed in a variety of shapes. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be rectangular, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, or may be constructed as another polygon, such as a hexagon, a circle or a portion of a circle, such as a semicircle, or with an odd or irregular shape. Preferably, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is roughly semicircular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The manner and material of construction of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be used to tailor the ease with which it is opened. For example, stiffer closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as those that are thicker or constructed of stiffer materials, will require more fluid pressure to open and may provide a better seal when closed, while more flexible closing members, such as those that are thinner or constructed of more flexible materials, may require less fluid pressure to open. It should also be appreciated that the degree of seal may also be dependant on the ability of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to conform to fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when in a closed position and, accordingly, if closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is too stiff to conform to fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it may inhibit the seal rather than improving it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in some embodiments, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a diaphragm. By diaphragm it is meant a generally planar structure attached at its edges to a base and having an opening therein. Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a diaphragm it may be constructed in any manner that permits fluid to flow past closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a first direction, but not in a second. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed such that it covers fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> but is allowed to move in a first direction, exposing an opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, through which fluid may flow. In this embodiment, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inhibited from moving in a second direction to expose opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by the shape of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may cover fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and be supported by a seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that covers opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as illustrated by flow indicators <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the lower portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, fluid moving through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a first direction pushes closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> away from seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and into an open position. Conversely, as illustrated by flow indicators <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the upper portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, fluid moving through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a second direction cannot push closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> past seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and, thus, cannot open it. In fact, fluid pressure in the second direction acts to seal closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a closed position, pushing it against seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and reducing the possibility of leakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a diaphragm including opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner that allows the passage of fluid through opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. For example, opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be constructed in a variety of shapes. For example, opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be square or rectangular, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, or may be constructed as another polygon, such as a hexagon, a circle or a portion of a circle, such as a semicircle, or with an odd or irregular shape. Seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner that supports closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> around at least the periphery of opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. For example, seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may also be constructed in a variety of shapes. Preferably, the shape of seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> corresponds to the shape of opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to ensure adequate support of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As is the case where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a flap, the manner and material of construction of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a diaphragm may be used to tailor the ease with which closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also be a free-floating member. Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a free-floating member it may be constructed in any manner and of any material or materials that allow closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to selectively permit or inhibit fluid flow past closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed such that it permits the flow of fluid in a first direction and inhibits the flow of fluid in a second direction. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is carried into and out of a narrow portion of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When fluid is flowing in a first direction, as illustrated by flow indicator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is carried into an open area, such that fluid can pass closing member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When fluid flows in a second direction, as illustrated by flow indicator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is carried by the fluid into seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, obstructing fluid flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a free-floating member, it may constructed to fit snugly within seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, inhibiting leakage when fluid flow is in the second direction. Preferably, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a spherical body and seat <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is circular in cross-section; while other shapes and arrangements are possible, this arrangement ensures a snug fit between closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, irrespective of the orientation of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed of any material or materials that allow it to selectively permit or inhibit fluid flow. Closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may also be made of a material that will not adversely affect or be affected by a fluid or fluids in microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as a material that is inert with respect to the fluid or fluids for use in microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The preferred material for closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> varies according to the nature of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a flexible member, such as flap or diaphragm, it is preferably constructed of an polymeric material, such as PDMS, as described previously with respect to fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Where closing member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a free-floating member, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed of a material that is easily moved by fluid flow and which may form a good seal with the material of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed of glass or other silicon-based material, a polymeric material, such as PDMS, or another relatively durable, lightweight material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be constructed as a one-use valve. By &ldquo;one-use valve&rdquo; it is meant a valve that, once opened, cannot be closed in the manner in which it was opened. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be a one-use valve opened by damage to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as a voltage difference across closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that results in breakdown and consequent formation of an opening in closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, modifying the temperature of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, or portions thereof, may be used to open a one-use valve. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, one embodiment of valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> configured as a one-use valve is illustrated. In the illustrated embodiment, a microfluidic system includes a first fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a second fluid path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and a first closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> disposed between the first and second fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> First and second fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be arranged in any manner that allows closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be formed between them. For example, first and second fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be arranged in a &ldquo;T&rdquo; shape, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. As an alternate example, fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be arranged end to end, effectively forming a single fluid path broken by closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, multiple fluid paths may be separated from one another by multiple closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the specific embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, ten fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are separated from a single, central fluid path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> by ten closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> may be part of a larger microfluidic system such as region <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. An arrangement such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> may be useful for adding materials in a particular order, as required in some analytical techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Where valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is constructed as a one-use valve, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed to be in a closed position such that fluid flow past or through closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inhibited or eliminated. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may include a substantially sealed barrier. Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is constructed to inhibit or eliminate fluid flow, the dimensions of closing member may vary with the application and the material from which closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is constructed. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be thick enough to remain closed until it is desired to open it, but not so thick that it can not be opened conveniently, for example, that excessive voltage is required to do so. For example, for some materials, closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between about 1 and about 100 micrometers thick maybe appropriate, for others, closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between about 5 and about 50 micrometers thick may be appropriate, for others, closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between about 15 and about 40 micrometers thick may be appropriate, and for still others, closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> about 20 micrometers thick may be desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> While embodiments of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for use with a one-use valve are illustrated herein as being generally planar and of uniform thickness, this disposition is not required, so long as closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be opened as desired in a convenient way, e.g. using an acceptable voltage. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be shaped as a hemisphere, other regular shape, or an odd or irregular shape. In some embodiments, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be shaped such that it opens in a desired manner or produces an opening having a desired shape. For example, some portions of closing members ember <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be thinner than other portions of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, making formation of an opening more likely in those portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Where closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is constructed to inhibit or eliminate fluid flow, it may be constructed of any material or materials described previously for formation of closing members as well as any other material or materials that are compatible with the fluids to be used, substantially fluid tight, and capable of being opened by an acceptable voltage. For example, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be constructed of a material having a breakdown voltage of less than about 250 volts per micrometer, a breakdown voltage of less than about 150 volts per micrometer, a breakdown voltage of less than about 75 volts per micrometer, or a breakdown voltage of less than about 25 volts per micrometer. Materials with these characteristics can be readily selected by those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, any polymer that is not soluble in the liquid(s) to be used in the microfluidic system may find utility in particular embodiments. In a preferred embodiment, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is constructed from a material previously disclosed for use in the formation of as fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In another preferred embodiment, closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are formed in a single piece of material, such as PDMS (PDMS has a breakdown voltage of 21 volts per micrometer). A material capable of being broken down by application of an acceptable voltage is referred to herein as a &ldquo;voltage degradable material.&rdquo; As described herein, an acceptable voltage may vary with the fluids to be used and other parameters of the specific microfluidic system. For example, where bubble formation may be undesired, an acceptable voltage would inhibit bubble formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a one way valve may be opened by providing a voltage to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such that an opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is formed therein. For example, a voltage greater than the breakdown voltage of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be provided such that opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is formed in closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Voltage applied to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be of either negative or positive polarity. Voltage may be applied in any manner so long as the voltage is directed to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, an electrical source may be used to provide the desired voltage. The electrical source may be any source of electricity capable of generating the desired voltage. For example, the electrical source may be a pizoelectrical source, a battery, or a device powered by household current. In one embodiment, a pizoelectrical discharge from a gas igniter was found to be sufficient to produce the desired voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Voltage may be supplied to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the use of electrodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. For example, electrodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be used to connect closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> directly or indirectly to an electrical source and/or to a ground <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, electrodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be placed directly in contact with closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, electrodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be placed in contact with fluid in fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, so long as the fluid is sufficiently conductive to provide voltage to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Where indirect supply of voltage to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is desired, the use of liquid fluids having sufficient ionic strength to be conductive is generally preferred, though any conductive fluid may be used. Fluids having an ionic strength of 10 mM (millimolar) and 166 mM were found to be suitable for transmitting the voltage, with the higher ionic strength fluid generating a larger opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Electrodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner that allows electricity to be transmitted directly or indirectly to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, electrodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include any conductive material compatible with the fluids and materials to be used in the microfluidic system. Higher conductivity materials that transmit voltage quickly to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, resulting in shorter voltage ramp times, and larger openings, as will be described below, are generally preferred. Examples of materials that may be form suitable electrodes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> include conductive metals such as steel, platinum, silver, gold and copper as well as other conductive materials, such a conductive polymeric materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In microfluidic systems having more than one closing member that may be opened, the fluid path on the opposite side of the closing member to be opened, and to which voltage is to be applied, may be grounded. For example, in microfluidic systems including multiple closing members connected to a single fluid path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, such as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, where voltage is to be applied to first fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, second fluid path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be grounded to inhibit opening of more than one closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> where this opening of more than one closing member is not desired. In a similarly configured embodiment where voltage is applied to second fluid path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> rather than first fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, first fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be grounded to promote opening of first fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and not other fluid paths connected by closing members to second fluid path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The voltage to open a particular closing member may vary depending on the construction of the closing member and its surroundings. For example, the thickness of the closing member and its breakdown voltage may affect the opening voltage. The ionic strength of fluid in fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may also affect the opening voltage. The theoretical minimum opening voltage required if delivered directly to the closing member is the product of the break down voltage of the material(s) forming the closing member and the thickness of the closing member. For, example, for PDMS closing members 20 micrometers thick and having a breakdown voltage of 21 volts per micrometer, the theoretical minimum pulse of voltage is 20 micrometers times 21 volts per micrometer or 420 V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Actual voltages may be applied to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that are greater than the theoretical minimum opening voltage. Applying voltages greater than the theoretical minimum may decrease the length of the voltage pulse required to create opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. For example, for 20 micrometer thick PDMS closing members, openings <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> were complete in less than 1 second for voltages above 1 kV, while a voltage of 2 kV created opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in 50 milliseconds and a voltage of 5 kV created opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in 20 milliseconds. The actual voltage at breakdown of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be less than the applied voltage because breakdown and the creation of opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may occur during the ramping period. For example, the above-described 2 kV and 5 kV pulses actually resulted in breakdown at 1.8 kV and 3.4 kV, respectively, because the breakdown occurred during the ramping period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The length of a voltage pulse may be any amount of time that produces the desired opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For some materials and conditions, the size of opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be independent of the length of the voltage pulse, so long as a minimum pulse length is used. For example, 50 millisecond, 60 millisecond and 1 second pulses of 2 kV across a PDMS closing member were found to produce openings <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of approximately the same size, as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may take any form that allows the desired amount of fluid to pass between fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. For example, opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be sized to allow the desired amount of fluid to pass between fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. For example, where a lower flow rate is preferred, opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be relatively small, while, where a higher flow rate is preferred, opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be larger. Depending on the embodiment, holes from about 2 micrometers in average diameter to about 50 micrometers in average diameter may be useful, and even smaller, or larger, openings <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be desired in particular embodiments. The size of opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be limited only by the size of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and may even exceed the size of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in some embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The voltage, voltage ramp rate and ionic strength of fluid within fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may affect the size of opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Specifically, higher voltages, faster ramp rates and higher ionic strength fluids typically result in larger openings. For example, constant voltage ramp rates, such as 500 V/50 ms, resulted in smaller openings than those when the ramp rate increased exponentially with time. In one particular embodiment where the voltage increased exponentially with time, the voltage as a function of time was roughly: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight>)&equals;5000*(1&minus;exp(&minus;<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight>/&tgr;) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> where t is time, V is voltage and &tgr; is resistance times capacitance (RC), which was 16 ms. Similarly, rate of distribution of charge from the electrode to the closing member is dependant on the resistivity of any fluid therebetween; increasing the ionic strength (decreasing the resistivity) of the fluid thus effectively shortens the ramp rate of the electrical source, resulting in a larger opening. Accordingly, a desired size of opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be provided by adjustment of these values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be any shape that allows the desired amount of fluid to pass between fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and need not be a single hole. For example, opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be of odd or irregular shape or may be of a particular shape dictated by the shape of closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As another example, opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may consist of a plurality of smaller holes in closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. With particular conditions and materials, such as PDMS, opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may generally be formed as a series of fissures or holes. Without wishing to be limited to any particular theory, it is believed that these fissures are caused by stresses occurring during breakdown, such as gas evolution and expansion, thermal stress, and chemical bond breaking. Suitable combinations of voltage and voltage pulse length to achieve an opening of a desired size/shape may be determined for a particular arrangement using routine experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Where a voltage pulse is applied to a closing member to open it, bubbles of gas may be formed in liquid-containing fluid paths adjacent the closing member after the connection is opened. The magnitude and length of a voltage pulse may affect the size of these bubbles. Lower magnitude, shorter voltage pulses may reduce bubble formation, while larger magnitude, longer voltage pulses may promote bubble formation. Without wishing to be limited to any particular theory, it is believed that high local temperatures accompanying the electrical breakdown of the closing member results in bubbles. Where bubbles are formed, such bubbles may dissipate. For example, bubbles formed from breakdown of 20 micrometer thick PDMS closing members may dissipate after about 30 seconds. Bubbles may also be moved out of the fluid paths, for example by pumping via applied pressure. Such pumping may be performed manually where the microfluidic system includes flexible fluid paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic systems incorporating one-use valves may be used in any application where it is desired to keep the fluid paths separated until a particular time. For example, fluids, such as reagents, analytes, and buffers may be stored in fluid paths. In microfluidic systems having multiple channels separated by one-use valves, opening the valves in a predetermined sequence may allow complex analyses and chemical reactions to be performed. For example, a microfluidic device for use in ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) experiments, which require several solutions be added separately and in a specific order, may be created using the one-use valves of the present invention; these solutions may include capture antibody, blocking agent, sample, antibody-enzyme conjugate, and enzyme substrate. Microfluidic fluid paths are especially suitable for ELISA because the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume reduces the effect of mass transport limitations. Furthermore, where PDMS is used to create some or all of the microfluidic system, some common capture antibodies for use with ELISA are readily adsorbed onto oxidized PDMS. Other potential uses for microfluidic systems incorporating one-use valves include chemical analysis, drug delivery, and chemical synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as thus far described is suitable for use as a valve. Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be expanded for use as a pump. In one embodiment of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use as a pump, microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a second closing member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> disposed along fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> disposed along fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between first closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and second closing member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As used herein, &ldquo;reservoir&rdquo; refers to any structure generally intended to hold a volume of fluid. Reservoirs may also function as fluid paths in that fluid may pass through them at times and fluid paths may sometimes function as reservoirs in that they may sometimes be used to hold fluid. Second closing member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner and of any material or materials previously described for closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. According to the embodiments of the invention illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> operate as check valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, check valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allow fluid to flow through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> only in the first direction, from inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be constructed in any manner and of any material or materials that do not adversely affect, and are not adversely affected by, fluid in reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and allow the pressure in reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be varied. Increasing the pressure in reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> beyond the pressure in fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may force fluid within reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> out of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. However, check valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allow fluid to flow only in the first direction (illustrated by flow indicators <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Accordingly, fluid will flow toward outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, but will not be permitted to flow toward inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Conversely, decreasing the pressure within reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to below the pressure within fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may draw fluid into reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Once again, check valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allow fluid to flow only in the first direction. Accordingly, fluid will be drawn from the direction of inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, but will not be permitted to flow in the second direction from outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> toward reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It will now be apparent that by alternately increasing and decreasing the pressure in reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> it is possible to pump fluid through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The speed of the pressure changes and the volume of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are generally directly proportional to the speed the fluid is pumped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is constructed such that the volume of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is variable, allowing the pressure within reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be varied by varying the volume of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Where the volume of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is variable, it may be variable due to the flexibility of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, pressure applied externally to reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may deflect reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, decreasing its volume and correspondingly increasing the pressure within it and pumping fluid toward outlet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. If reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is elastomeric, when the external pressure is removed from reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> it will return to its original shape, increasing its volume, decreasing the pressure within it, and drawing fluid from inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed from an elastomeric material, such as the polymers discussed previously. Reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be constructed according to the rapid prototyping technique described later herein. Where desired, this process may be modified to increase the volume of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For example, the portion of the master corresponding to the reservoir may be constructed to be thicker than the rest of the master, leading to a larger reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the portion of the master corresponding to the reservoir may have an additional material, such as an epoxy, added thereto to increase its thickness and, thus, the volume of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Such an arrangement may also allow the upper wall of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be made thinner, allowing its volume to be more easily adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 15</cross-reference>, microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use as a pump may include more than one check valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along flow path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> before and after reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For example, two, three or more check valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be included on either side of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to inhibit back-flow during actuation of the pump. In one embodiment, similar to that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> pressure of about 150 Pa (Pascals) was generated in the adjacent fluid paths by compression of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with a flow rate of about 0.66 microliters per stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Where microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use as a pump includes reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a variable volume, the volume may be varied in any manner that produces the desired pumping function. For example, where reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is constructed of an elastomeric material, the volume of reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be varied manually. Such a reservoir may be sized and shaped to complement a thumb or finger; for example, it may be roughly oval and about 2 square cm. In another example, microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be constructed with a second reservoir adjacent to reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a fluid, such as air, may be pumped into and out of the second reservoir such that it compresses or expands the second reservoir and correspondingly expands or compresses reservoir <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> due to its proximity in the elastomeric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention may be flexible. For example, where components of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are constructed of a flexible material some, or all, of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be flexible. Some embodiments of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention may be constructed entirely of elastomeric polymers, such as PDMS. Flexible microfluidic systems according to the present invention are resistant to breakage and may be bent or twisted. For example, microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be constructed for use as an assaying device for fieldwork, such as on-site environmental testing or medical diagnosis. In such a device a lengthy fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be desirable to promote a reaction or separation, but may interfere with portability. According to the present invention the microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be coiled, allowing a lengthy fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be contained within a relatively small space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In some instances where microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is flexible, it may be desirable to increase its structural stability and ability to resist damage or deformation. In this case, it is preferred to provide support to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, support is provided without compromising the flexibility of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be supported on a support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). Support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be flexible and may be constructed in any manner and of any material or materials that provide the desired degree of support, stability and flexibility to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be constructed of a polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be connected to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in any manner and using any materials that provide the desired connection. For example, in some embodiments, it may be desired to form a reversible connection to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and, in others, an irreversible connection. Support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be connected to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using an adhesive, such as a conventional pressure-sensitive adhesive. In some instances, conventional adhesive tapes may perform as suitable supports. For example, an adhesive tape with a silicone adhesive on a polyester backing is a suitable support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for some applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention may be constructed using any method that will repeatably produce microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having the desired structure and functionality. For example, microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or portions of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, may be constructed by conventional etching techniques known in the art. Preferably, microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is constructed according to the method of the invention, as disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, a method for making a microfluidic system includes providing a master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> corresponding to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, forming microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, connecting support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and removing microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The act of providing master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> corresponding to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be performed in any manner that produces master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> corresponding to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be produced by conventional etching techniques. More specifically, in one embodiment, master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> corresponding to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be constructed by producing high resolution transparencies according to computer designs, such as CAD drawings, corresponding to the design of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These transparencies may then be used as masks when transferring a pattern into negative photoresist by conventional photolithography, yielding a master with positive relief of fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and other features of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This method is described in more detail in &ldquo;Rapid Prototyping of Microfluidic Systems in Poly(dimethylsiloxane).&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>1988, 70, 4974-4984., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, two masters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are illustrated, one corresponding to a flow path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for use with diaphragm closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the other corresponding to diaphragm closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The act of forming microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be performed in any manner that produces microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> capable of providing desired fluid flow properties. For example, microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be cast or molded onto master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, a moldable polymer or prepolymer may be placed in contact with master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and polymerized or cured such that it has sufficient rigidity to provide desired fluid flow properties in microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The desired stiffness may vary with the intended application for microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, if microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is desired to be flexible, it is preferred to use a flexible polymer. In a preferred embodiment, forming microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is performed by replica molding against the master and the preferred material is PDMS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, in some embodiments, a secondary master <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be used. For example, where microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes flow path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with features on both sides of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as flow path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or opening <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> passing through microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a secondary master <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be used. Accordingly, secondary master <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may corresponding to the side of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> facing away from master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, secondary master <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may include a flat sheet to squeeze excess material out of master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and to ensure that flow path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> passing through microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not blocked by such material. Pressure may be exerted upon secondary master <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to ensure the desired amount of material is squeezed out of master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The pressure exerted may depend, for example, on the type of material being used to form microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the amount of material that must be squeezed out of master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In some instances, pressure of about 1 pound per square inch (psi) may be applied to secondary master <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Preferably, secondary master <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is formed of a material that is easily removed from microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as Teflon&reg; polytetrafluoroethylene (&ldquo;PTFE&rdquo;) available from DuPont Corporation of Delaware. Secondary master <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be treated to ensure that it is smooth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The act of connecting support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be performed in any manner that provides the desired degree of connection. For example, in some embodiments, it may be desired to form a temporary connection only strong enough to pull microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, while in other embodiments it may be desired to for an irreversible connection as has been previously discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The act of removing microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be performed in any manner that will not damage microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be lifted away from master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, pulling microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with it. After microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removed from master <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may remain attached the microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, serving as a substrate, or support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be used to facilitate transfer to another substrate or microfluidic system, as will be discussed below. Where support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is used to facilitate transfer of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as illustrated for closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be removed from microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when the transfer has been accomplished. The act of removing support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from microfluidic system may be performed in any manner that does not harm microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, if an adhesive was used to connect support <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a material may be used to dissolve the adhesive without dissolving or damaging microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, an appropriate solvent may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed by the method of the invention may be combined with other microfluidic systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form larger microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, a more complex microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as a microfluidic system intended for use as a valve or a pump, may be formed as layers according to the method of the invention and then connected. In most embodiments, it is preferred that such connections between layers of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> be substantially irreversible. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> illustrates making a portion of microfluidic system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> configured as a diaphragm valve, such as that illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, from two microfluidic systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, one including fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the other configured as closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A rapid prototyping method was used for the design and fabrication of microfluidic valves and pumps. First, high-resolution transparencies were produced from a CAD file containing a design of fluid paths. These transparencies were used as masks in transferring the design into negative photoresist by conventional photolithography, yielding a master with positive relief of fluid paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The valves were made from two molded PDMS bas-relief plates and a membrane. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the parts were fabricated separately and later assembled to complete the valves. First, one PDMS bas-relief plate was constructed (a) by replica molding against the master using procedures known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A PDMS membrane was constructed (b) by casting and curing the PDMS prepolymer between a master and a secondary master in the form of a Teflon&reg; PTFE sheet (1 mm thick Teflon&reg; FEP, DuPont, Del.). Modest pressure (1 psi) was applied to the secondary master/PDMS/master sandwich while curing to squeeze out excess PDMS prepolymer. The PDMS membranes were 25-100 &mgr;m thick, as thick as the negative resist (SU-8, MicroChem, Mass.) used in making the master. A master with photoresist posts, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, was used to obtain PDMS membranes with through-holes. Prior to use as the secondary master, the Teflon&reg; PTFE sheet was molded against a flat Si wafer surface at 300&deg; C. (T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>&equals;270&deg; C.) to obtain a smooth surface. </bold></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> After curing, the secondary master was removed to leave behind the PDMS membrane attached to the master. A pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA, Furon M803 adhesive tape with silicone adhesive on polyester back, Furon, Conn.) was applied on the PDMS membrane as a support. Due to stronger adhesion between the support and PDMS compared to that between PDMS and master, it was possible to transfer the membrane from the master to the support by peeling the support away from the master. The membrane, once transferred onto the support, could be handled without distortion. The support was removed by applying appropriate solvents (acetone or ethanol) after manipulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The support/PDMS membrane was placed in an aligner and bonded (c) with PDMS bas-relief plate to form the lower part of the valve. The aligner was constructed from a set of x-y-z micrometer stages mounted on a translation post. The patterned PDMS membranes (supported on support or master) and bas-relief plates were placed on the top and bottom micrometer stages and aligned using a stereo microscope. Irreversible bonding of the PDMS pieces was achieved by surface modification by oxygen plasma treatment. After alignment, the assembly containing the aligner and the PDMS pieces were placed in oxygen plasma (Harrick, Pa.) for 30 sec. (60 W, 200 m Torr). The PDMS pieces were brought into contact immediately after they were removed from the plasma generator. Complete, functional valves were fabricated by repeating (c) with another bas-relief plate that forms the top fluid path. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic systems incorporating one-use valves were constructed of two layers, one layer with embedded fluid paths and one flat layer. To fabricate the layer with the fluid paths, PDMS was molded against a photolithographic master produced by rapid prototyping and comprising a positive relief of photoresist on a silicon wafer. (See &ldquo;Rapid Prototyping of Microfluidic Systems in Poly(dimethylsiloxane).&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>1988, 70, 4974-4984.) Holes were cut in the PDMS using circular punches to form fluid reservoirs. The layer with fluid paths was sealed against a flat piece of PDMS or a glass slide by oxidizing both layers in an air plasma and then bringing them into conformal contact. The plasma oxidation used in the sealing process rendered the channels hydrophilic, and they were readily filled with aqueous buffer. Dead-end channels filled by capillary action in less than 5 minutes. The microfluidic systems included of at least two disconnected channels separated by 20 &mgr;m closing members, for example as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. This separation was limited by the resolution of the printing used in the first step of rapid prototyping. A higher-resolution printer would allow thinner separations and lower voltages to operate. The channels were 50 or 100 &mgr;m wide and 60 &mgr;m tall. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The valves constructed in Example 1 were tested for long-term operation using an external three-way electromechanical valve (Lee Valve, Westbrook, Conn.) connected to a pressurized air source (functionality of the valves was tested with liquids before and after long-term testing with pressurized air). The inlet of the valve was connected to the electromechanical valve which pressurized and vented the valve at &tilde;10 Hz. The outlet of the valve was submerged in a water bath and the generation of a bubble with each opening and closing was monitored. The PDMS diaphragm valves were tested continuously for 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>openings and closings. The valves did not show any marked deterioration and were fully functional when tested with fluids (water). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Both diaphragm and flap valves were still fully functional when tested after storing them for six months in the open laboratory. Only the valves that had dried solids around the membrane that could not be removed were not functional. The ones with particle/deposit that were washed and cleaned functioned without any problems. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of one embodiment of a valve according to the present invention in reducing back flow, flow tests were performed on a valve as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> were connected to three of four walls (the two sides and the bottom) of a rectangular fluid path 90 micrometers high and 150 micrometers wide. The width of the fluid path in the area of closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> was greater than the width elsewhere in the fluid path. Closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> were designed not to touch at rest, with no fluid flowing, and were separated by 20 micrometers. Closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> were the same height as fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (90 micrometers) and tapered from the walls of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a width at their ends of approximately 20 micrometers. The dimensions of the valves depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are about 40% larger than those used in this example. The top of each closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> where it abutted the top of fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> was coated with petroleum jelly for lubrication, as illustrated by shading in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> For the particular dimensions of this embodiment, a back pressure of approximately 1.7 kPa (kilopascals) was required to bring together closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Back flow rates between 0 microliters per second and 0.3 microliters per second (0.3 microliters per second corresponded to 1.7 kPa) resulted in slight opening of closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> resulting in reduced pressure drop. However, as soon as a back flow of 0.3 microliters per second was reached, the closing members were pushed together by the pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</cross-reference> are graphs of the resistance of the valve versus the flow rate through the valve and pressure drop across the valve versus the flow rate through the valve, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> illustrates that the partial closure of closing members <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is more abrupt than their opening. Based on the slopes of pressure drop versus flow rate, three states of the valve may be defined: &ldquo;closed&rdquo; at large negative (back flow) flow rates, &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; at low flow rates, and &ldquo;fully open&rdquo; at relatively large positive flow rates. The linear regression of the pressure drop versus flow rate curve is an alternative measure of the fluidic resistance over each of the regions. The resistance of the valve was 20&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>, 4.4&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>, and 2.4&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>&mgr;L<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>in the closed, neutral, and open positions, respectively. The resistance to flow across the valve of this embodiment was therefore approximately 8 times greater for back flow than for forward flow. This demonstrates that this embodiment of the valve of the present invention is effective as a check valve. Without wishing to be limited to any particular theory, it is believed that the inhibition, as opposed to nearly complete stoppage, of flow was due to the gap at the bottom of the fluid path where the closing members are not free to move together, as well as gaps at the top of the fluid path where the closing members are not connected. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Also to demonstrate durability of the microfluidic system described in Example 4, the microfluidic system was filled with a sodium chloride solution and the liquid was evaporated leaving a salt crust on the fluid paths and closing members. Function was restored upon rehydration, again demonstrating durability of the microfluidic system. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In order to determine the effect of applied voltage on opening size and minimum pulse length for one-use valves, experiments were performed at several voltages. PDMS closing members 20 micrometers thick were used in the experiments. After the openings were formed, fluorescein was pumped through the openings. The results of some of these experiments are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which are photocopies of fluorescent micrographs of openings formed by voltages of 1 kV, 2 kV, 5 kV and 10 kV, respectively. Voltages from 1 kV to 5 kV were applied by a commercial power supply (CZE1000R, Spellman High Voltage, Hauppauge, N.Y.) controlled by an analog output board (PCI-MIO-16XE-50, National Instruments, Austin, Tex.) and LabVIEW &reg; software (National Instruments), while the approximately 10 kV voltage was applied by a gas igniter (Weber-Stephen Products, Burlington, Canada). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Openings were formed in one second for 1 kV, 50 milliseconds for 2 kV, 20 milliseconds for 5 kV, and 20 microseconds for 10 kV. Voltages greater than 2 kV achieved reproducible openings, but the size and shape of the openings were variable. Where openings were formed, the approximate average diameters openings were 5 micrometers for 1 kV, 20 micrometers for 2 kV, 50 micrometers for 5 kV and 5 micrometers for 10 kV (supplied by the gas igniter). Without wishing to be limited to a particular theory, it is believed that the smaller hole at 10 kV was due to the very short duration of the pulse generated by the igniter or to the fact that that the power generated by the igniter was less than that produced by the commercial power supply. The pressure required to pump the fluorescein through the openings was greatest for the opening formed by 1 kV and least for the opening formed by 5 kV. The results of these experiments demonstrate that higher voltages generally produce larger holes and require shorter pulses to form openings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Experiments were performed in order to determine the effect of the ionic strength of a fluid positioned within fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, on the opening of a one-use valve. As ionic fluids PBS (10 mM (millimolar) phosphate, 138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4, I (Ionic strength) approximately 166 mM) and Tris-Gly (25 mM Tris-192 mM Gly, I approximately 10 mM) containing 0.1 micromolar fluorescein were used. The experiments were performed in a microfluidic system such as that illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, where two fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are separated by a PDMS closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> approximately 20 micrometers in thickness. A voltage of &minus;5 kV was applied to fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, with fluid path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> grounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The results of these experiments are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, wherein white regions indicate the presence of fluorescein, thus, fluid. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 36</cross-reference> show horizontal sections 2.6 micrometers thick of the closing members (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> shows the opening formed with a PBS buffer. The opening is halfway between the PDMS-glass seam (top the fluid path) and the bottom of the fluid path. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> shows the middle of an opening formed with the Tris-Gly buffer (approximately 5 micrometers from the PDMS bottom of the channel). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 and 37</cross-reference> show vertical sections (2 micrometers thick) of connections half way between fluid paths <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (10 micrometers from either channel). Closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned between a glass support <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and a PDMS base <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> shows an opening formed with PBS. This opening extended from the top to the bottom of the fluid path and consisted primarily of two fissures, each about 10 micrometers in average diameter. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> shows the approximately 10 micrometer average diameter opening (height of about 30 micrometers) formed with the Tris-Gly buffer. These experiments demonstrate that a buffer with a higher ionic strength produces larger holes than a buffer with a lower ionic strength. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 9 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In order to determine the minimum voltage required to form an opening, experiments were performed using a 20 micrometer thick PDMS closing member with both Tris-Gly and PBS buffers (as used in Example 8). The theoretical voltage to open such a closing member is 420 V. Current flow was observed at 500 V, but formation of openings was not reproducible at this voltage. Openings formed more frequently as the voltage was increased to 600 V, 750 V, and 1 kV, but again the results were not reproducible. In some cases it was possible to open a connection by repeatedly applying a given voltage or applying a higher voltage across a smaller opening. Without wishing to be limited to any particular theory, it is believed that these variations are due to heterogeneities in the PDMS. These experiments demonstrate that voltages higher than the theoretical minimum may be required to produce openings in some instances and that higher voltages are more likely to form openings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In order to demonstrate that the one-use valves of the present invention can be used to produce relatively complex microfluidic systems, an ELISA device was developed. This device is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> and included 5 reservoirs <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. A &ldquo;T&rdquo; shaped fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected reservoirs <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>; each of these reservoirs had an average diameter of 4 mm. Reservoir <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> served as a reservoir for waste, and reagents, sample, and rinse solution were added in reservoirs <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. Reservoirs <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, which were approximately 1 mm in average diameter, were disconnected from fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, but were connected to syringes containing reagents and to closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by fluid paths <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. A detection chamber <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> in fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> was used to present a larger surface (600&times;600 micrometers) area for observation. Coupling from the syringes (1 mL, Henke-Sass, Wolf, Tuttlingen, Germany) to the device was accomplished by using polyethylene tubing (outer diameter 1.09 mm, inner diameter 0.38 mm, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) that was pressure fit into reservoirs <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Flow of the coating antibody, rinsing solution, and sample was by hydrodynamic pressure from 50 microliters of fluid in reservoirs <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to reservoir <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Antibodies and buffers for the ELISA were obtained from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, Tex.). Human hemoglobin (Hb) was used as the analyte. The Hb-specific capture antibody (sheep anti-human Hb, 10 micrograms per milliliter, in 50 mM Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, pH 9.6) was added through reservoirs <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to coat fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1% in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8) was flowed into fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for one hour to block the surface and to prevent non-specific adsorption of proteins in subsequent steps. After the sample was introduced through fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a 1 second pulse of 1 kV was used to create an opening in closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between fluid path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> connected to reservoir <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Anti-Hb antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (sheep anti-human Hb, 10 micrograms per milliliter in 1% BSA, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8) was pumped into fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a syringe pump for one hour. Fluids were pumped at a constant rate of 50 microliters per hour. Finally, an opening was formed in closing member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected to reservoir <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and fluid path <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with a 1 second pulse of 1 kV. The substrate, ELF-97 (0.5 mM in 1% BSA, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8, Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), was pumped into the device for 10 minutes. ELF-97 was soluble and non-fluorescent when phosphorylated. Between each step, fluid path <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> was rinsed with two aliquots of 50 microliter of 50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween &reg; <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (ICI America, North Little Rock, Ark.), pH 8. Upon hydrolysis of the phosphate group by alkaline phosphatase, however, the species precipitated and fluoresced green upon exposure to UV light. If no Hb was present in the sample, the substrate did not react, and no fluorescence was observed, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>. If Hb was present, the substrate reacted, and, after about 5 minutes, fluorescence was observed in the device as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference>. Although fluorescent microscopy was used to document the results, the results were able to be seen by the naked eye with a UV lamp. This experiment demonstrates that a relatively complex assaying device may be created using the one way valves of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to high throughput screening of cDNA libraries. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The majority of known proteins were identified using traditional genetics or biochemistry. The availability of complete genome sequences for several organisms and the anticipation of the completion of the human genome project effectively make thousands of new proteins &ldquo;known&rdquo;. The problem, however, is that while thousands of new open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified, the functions of these proteins remain a mystery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Sequence analysis is a powerful predictor of protein function, but many ORFs cannot be assigned by sequence analysis and experimental characterization is still required to ascertain protein function. There is tremendous interest in high-throughput approaches for testing cDNA libraries, which include thousands of unique ORFs, using genetic or biochemical screens. The hurdles are the same as in all high-throughput screening applications. First, cDNA libraries must be available in a format that is compatible with screening technologies and that allows rapid identification of individual cDNAs. Second, high-throughput screens must be developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Commercial cDNA libraries, tissue-specific cDNA libraries, and even cell-cycle-specific cDNA libraries from a variety of organisms are readily available. Over the past few years, these cDNA libraries have been adapted to several formats amenable to high-throughput screening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Expression cloning relies on split-pool in vitro transcription/translation and has the advantage that it is compatible with many traditional biochemical assays. Winzler et al. used homologous recombination to engineer 2026 unique yeast strains&mdash;each containing a knock-out of a different ORF and replacing that ORF with a unique 20 base-pair tag. Several laboratories have reported specific yeast two-hybrid cDNA libraries, and many of these libraries are even distributed commercially (Clontech). Martzen et al. constructed 6144 individual yeast strains where each strain expresses a unique <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>ORF-GST fusion protein under control of the P<highlight><subscript>CUP1 </subscript></highlight>promoter. Because of the facility of homologous recombination in <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>, these cDNA libraries were prepared simply by co-transforming the cDNA library with the appropriate linearized vector. Thus, replicating these expression formats with different cDNA libraries is routine. The most common traditional genetic selection is lethality, or synthetic-lethality. A variety of phenotype-specific screens have also been employed. However, most of these are too time consuming for screening cDNA libraries. A few phenotype-specific selections have been reported. Screens and selections designed for the high-throughput screening of cDNA libraries have also been reported. One of the major applications envisioned for the yeast two-hybrid assay is the screening of cDNA libraries for protein-protein interactions. The success of the yeast three-hybrid assay suggests that it should also be possible to screen cDNA libraries for small-molecule-protein interactions. Another approach is to screen for changes in expression levels of individual cellular RNAs. In Genetic Footprinting, random Ty1 transposon insertions in genomic DNA are used as markers for changes in the expression levels of endogenous RNAs based on reverse transcription and gel electrophoresis. The use of unique oligonucleotide tags rather than Tyl transposon insertions facilitates rapid identification of individual RNAs. DNA microarrays, in which oligonucleotides corresponding to each individual ORF are synthesized on chips in a spatially-resolved format, have been used successfully in a number of recent applications. A recent report in which expression cloning identified a new family of uracil-DNA glycosylases from a Xenopus cDNA library based on in vitro binding assays suggests the importance of screening based on biochemical activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> WO 01/53355 describes a number of screening approaches, including the use of small molecules to induce protein dimerization to screen cDNA libraries based on binding, or small molecules with cleavable linkers to screen cDNA libraries based on catalysis. The CID technology offers a promising approach to screening cDNA libraries based on function because a variety of activities can be assayed simply by changing one of the CID ligand/receptor pairs or by changing the bond between the CID ligands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, the existing CID approaches rely on 4 non-covalent interactions taking place simultaneously for the reporter protein to be activated. Specifically, 1) the DNA-binding protein-DNA interaction, 2) the 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>ligand-receptor interaction, 3) the 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>ligand-receptor interaction, and 4) the activation domain-transcription machinery interaction. This approach is useful in certain types of screens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An approach not employed by the reported CID screens is making a system with only 3 non-covalent interactions, yet still employing a small molecule as the CID. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of this invention are compounds having the formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>H1-Y-H2 </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> where H1 is a substrate capable of selectively binding to a first receptor; where H2 is a substrate capable of selectively binding to and selectively forming a covalent bond with a second receptor; and wherein Y is a moiety providing a covalent linkage between H1 and H2, which may be present or absent, and when absent, H1 is covalently linked to H2. Also described are cells for use with the compounds for in vivo screening of compounds and proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In this compound, the 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>ligand-receptor pair (Dex-GR in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) is replaced with a small molecule-receptor pair that will form an irreversible covalent linkage, making a system with only 3 non-covalent interactions. Such an approach allows for the screening of small molecules to identify their cellular targets. This covalent CID system is used for screening the ligand receptor interaction, which used to be laborious work by using the photo cross linking, radio labeled ligand binding and affinity chromatography techniques. The covalent system is more sensitive than the Dex-Mtx system because the covalent bond gives zero k<highlight><subscript>off </subscript></highlight>for the covalent ligand-protein binding pair and then the cut-off Kd of the whole system is enhanced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As discussed, the foregoing may be adapted to the determination of the binding specificity of biomolecules is important not only for understanding the mechanisms and pathways of biological systems, but also because this binding specificity provides information for the future development of therapeutic and diagnostic agents. This invention describes a cell-based assay for detecting binding activities of steroids to better understand their in vivo molecular recognition. Steroid hormones are essential for the regulation of salts and water in the body, for metabolism, and for the maturation and sexual development of males and females. Moreover, the development of several kinds of cancer has been linked directly to steroids as causative agents. Due to the necessary role that steroids play in bodily functions, it is important to learn about their interactions with cellular targets to understand how they demonstrate this dual behavior. The screen builds from existing technology for dimerizing proteins within cells, using chemical inducers of dimerization (&ldquo;CID&rdquo; or &ldquo;CIDs&rdquo;). By using a steroid as one of the ligands of the dimeric small-molecule CIDs, binding can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The foregoing embodiments of the subject invention may be accomplished according to the guidance which follows. Certain of the foregoing embodiments are exemplified. Sufficient guidance is provided for a skilled artisan to arrive at all of the embodiments of the subject invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Selection Strategy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The selection strategy is based on existing methods for controlling protein dimerization in vivo using small molecules (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Several &ldquo;chemical inducers of dimerization&rdquo; have been reported showing that protein dimerization can be bridged by small molecules. (Spencer; Crabtree) Moreover, a number of techniques exist for translating the dimerization of two proteins to an in vivo screen or selection. (Hu 1990; Hu 1995; Fields; Gyuris; Johnsson; Rossi; Karimova) Taken together, this work establishes that it is feasible to use a small molecule H1-H2 to dimerize two fusion protein, reporter V-H1 receptor and reporter W-H2 receptor, generating a cellular read-out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Disclosed a general method for screening a CDNA library based on the ability of members of that library to express a protein capable of binding to H1 or H2 or an ability of that protein to catalyze a reaction to either form or cleave the covalent coupling between H1 and H2. That is, the small-molecule H1-X-BOND-Y-H2 represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is used to mediate protein dimerization and hence a cellular signal. Then the polypeptide enzyme that binds to either H1 or H2 is selected. The selection is tied to the cellular &ldquo;read-out&rdquo; because only cells containing the polypeptide which binds will have the desired phenotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The strategy is both general and a direct selection for polypeptides which bind. The selection can be applied to a broad range of polypeptides because protein dimerization depends only on the H1 and H2 selected. It is a direct selection for the polypeptides because binding of H1 and H2 is necessary for protein dimerization. Also, this strategy does not limit the starting protein scaffold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Preparation and Design of Handles &ldquo;H1&rdquo; and &ldquo;H2&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Ideally, a chemical handle should bind its receptor with high affinity (&lE;100 nM), cross cell membranes yet be inert to modification or degradation, be available in reasonable quantities, and present a convenient side-chain for routine chemical derivatization that does not disrupt receptor binding. Again, we build from DEX-FK506 (H1-H2) mediated dimerization of LexA-rGR and B42-FKBP12 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) (Licitra). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Dexamethasone (DEX) is a very attractive chemical handle H1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). DEX binds rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with a KD of 5 nM, (Chakraborti) can regulate the in vivo activity and nuclear localization of GR fusion proteins (Picard), and is commercially available. Affinity columns for rGR have been prepared via the C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>&prop;-hydroxy ketone of dexamethasone. (Govindan; Manz). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The antibacterial and anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) is used in place of FK506 as the chemical handle H2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B, 5C</cross-reference>) FK506 is not available in large quantities, coupling via the C<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>allyl group requires several chemical transformations including silyl protection of FK506, (Spencer; Pruschy) and FK506 is both acid and base-sensitive. (Wagner; Coleman) MTX, on the other hand, is commercially available and can be modified selectively at its &ggr;-carboxylate without disrupting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) binding. (Kralovec; Bolin) Even though MTX inhibits DHFR with pM affinity, (Bolin; Sasso) both <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>grow in the presence of MTX when supplemented with appropriate nutrients. (Huang) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The ability of DEX-MTX to mediate the dimerization of LexA-rGR and B42-DHFR is tested by (1) synthesis of a series of DEX-MTX molecules with simple diamine linkers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>); and (2) showing that DEX-MTX can dimerize LexA-rGR and B42-DHFR based on lacZ transcription and that both DEX and MTX uncoupled, can, competitively disrupt this dimerization. Cell permeable chemical handles that can be prepared readily and that are efficient at inducing protein dimerization not only are essential to the robustness of this selection methodology but also should find broad use as chemical inducers of protein dimerization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Dexamethasone (DEX) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) present a particularly attractive chemical handle/receptor pair. Dexamethasone is the cortical steroid with the highest affinity for the rat Glucocorticoid Receptor. The rGR binds DEX with a K<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of 5 nM, and mutants of rGR have been isolated with up to 10-fold higher affinity for DEX. (Chakraborti) The steroid dexamethasone has been used extensively as a cell-permeable small molecule to regulate the in vivo activity and nuclear localization of GR fusion proteins. (Picard) This work firmly establishes that DEX is cell permeable and is not modified or broken down in the cell. Recently, there has been one report of a yeast &ldquo;three-hybrid&rdquo; system in which a GR-DNA-binding protein fusion and a FKBP12-transcription activation domain fusion could be dimerized by the small molecule DEX-FK506 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Dexamethasone is commercially available in large quantities. Affinity columns for rGR have been prepared via oxidation of the C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>a-hydroxy ketone of DEX to the corresponding carboxylic acid. (Govindan, Manz) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Methotrexate (MTX) inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is one of the textbook examples of high-affinity ligand binding. The interaction between MTX and DHFR is extremely well characterized both biochemically and structurally. DHFR is a monomeric protein and binds MTX with picomolar affinity. (Bolin, Sasso) Even though MTX inhibits DHFR with such high affinity, both <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>grow in the presence of MTX when supplemented with appropriate nutrients. (Huang) The ability of MTX to serve both as an antibacterial and an anticancer agent is clear evidence that MTX has excellent pharmacokinetic properties. MTX is known to be imported into cells via a specific folate transporter protein. MTX is commercially available and can be synthesized readily from simple precursors. MTX can be modified selectively at its g-carboxylate without disrupting its interaction with DHFR. (Kralovec, Bolin) There are several examples reported where MTX has been modified via its g-carboxylate to prepare affinity columns and antibody conjugates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Given the number of cellular pathways that depend on cascades of dynamic protein-protein interactions, the ability to regulate protein oligomerization in vivo with small molecules should have broad applications in medicine and basic science. The key to realizing the potential of these small molecules both for the catalysis screen in the laboratory and for these biomedical applications is developing H1-H2 molecules that can be prepared readily and are efficient at inducing protein dimerization in vivo. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Derivative of the mentioned compounds with groups suitable for linking without interfering with receptor binding can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> It has been found that the combination of the Mtx moiety containing CID with DHFR binding domain containing fusion protein is a highly useful and widely applicable. Mtx and the DHFR receptor present a particularly attractive chemical handle/receptor pair. In addition to having a picomolar binding affinity, the complex of an Mtx moiety and the DHFR binding domain is extremely well characterized. The excellent pharmacokinetic properties of Mtx make it an ideal moiety to be used in procedures where ease of importation into cells is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Linking H1 and H2 through a Linker </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> To illustrate how the handles H1 and H2 may be linked together, several of the DEX-DEX compounds that have been synthesized to date are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The linkers are all commercially available or can be prepared in a single step. The linkers vary in hydrophobicity, length, and flexibility. a series of DEX-DEX molecules have been synthesized (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). The DEX-DEX molecules shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> were prepared from Dexamethasone and the corresponding diamines. The C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>a-hydroxy ketone of dexamethasone was oxidized using sodium periodate to the corresponding carboxylic acid in quantitative yield as described. The diamines are commercially available. The diamine corresponding to DEX-DEX 2 was prepared from a,a&prime;-dibromo-m-xylene and aminoethanethiol and used crude. The diamines were coupled to the carboxylic acid derivative of dexamethasone using the peptide-coupling reagent PyBOP under standard conditions in 60-80% yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> We have synthesized a DEX-MTX molecule. The retrosynthesis is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The synthesis is designed to be modular so that we can easily bring in a variety of linkers in one of the final steps as the dibromo- or diiodo-derivatives. For synthetic ease, the glutamate residue has been replaced with homocysteine. This replacement should be neutral because there is both biochemical and structural evidence that the g-carboxylate of methotrexate can be modified without disrupting DHFR binding. The final compound has been synthesized in 12 steps in 1.3% overall yield. Also synthesized are analogous compounds where the a,a&prime;-dibromo-m-xylene linker is replaced with 1,5-diiodopentane or 1,10-diiododecane. A similar route is used to prepare MTX-MTX molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Design of the Protein Chimeras </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The second important feature is the design of the protein chimeras. The yeast two-hybrid assay was chosen in the examples because of its flexibility. Specifically, the Brent two-hybrid system is used, which uses LexA as the DNA-binding domain and B42 as the transcription activation domain. The Brent system is one of the two most commonly used yeast two-hybrid systems. An advantage of the Brent system is that it does not rely on Gal4 allowing use of the regulatable Gal promoter. lacZ under control of 4 tandem LexA operators are used as the reporter gene. Initially, we chose to make simple LexA-GR and DHFR and B42-GR and DHFR fusion proteins that do not depart from the design of the Brent system. In the Brent system, the full length LexA protein which includes both the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain is used. The B42 domain is a monomer. The C-terminal hormone-binding domain of the rat Glucocorticoid Receptor is chosen because this domain was shown to work previously in the yeast three-hybrid system reported by Licitra, et al. Both the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and the murine DHFRs are used because these are two of the most well characterized DHFRs. The <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>protein has the advantage that methotrexate binding is independent of NADPH binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Construction of the LexA- and B42-receptor fusions is facilitated by the availability of commercial vectors for the Brent two-hybrid system. These vectors are shuttle vectors that can be manipulated both in bacteria and yeast. The LexA chimera is under control of the strong, constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. The B42 chimera is under control of the strong, regulatable galactose promoter. Both the GR and the two DHFR genes were introduced into the multiple cloning sites of the commercial LexA and B42 expression vectors using standard molecular biology techniques. The GR fusions are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The available restriction sites result in a three amino acid spacer between the two proteins in both the GR and the DHFR constructs. The plasmids encoding the LexA- and B42-fusion proteins were introduced in all necessary combinations into <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>strain FY250 containing a plasmid encoding the lacZ reporter plasmid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Three initial assays are conducted: (1) toxicity of the ligand and receptor, (2) cell permeability of the H1-H2 molecules as judged by competition in the yeast three-hybrid system, and (3) activation of lacZ transcription by the H1-H2 molecule as judged by X-gal hydrolysis. All of these experiments have been done as plate assays. The toxicity of the ligand and receptor is judged simply by seeing if either induction of the receptor fusions or application of the ligand to the plate impairs cell growth. Cell permeability is assessed based on the ability of an excess of DEX-DEX or DEX-MTX to disrupt DEX-FK506 induction of lacZ transcription in the yeast three-hybrid system. An excess of DEX-DEX or DEX-MTX should bind to all of the available LexA-GR chimera and disrupt transcription activation so long as the molecule is cell permeable and retains the ability to bind to GR. Effective protein dimerization by H1-H2 is assayed by activation of lacZ transcription. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The DEX-DEX molecules is tested by all three assays. Preliminary results show that neither DEX nor GR are toxic. Under the conditions tried thus far, none of the DEX-DEX molecules tested are efficient at protein dimerization as judged by the lacZ transcription assay. We have been able to repeat the yeast three-hybrid result&mdash;activation of lacZ transcription using DEX-FK506, in our lab. DEX-DEX 1 and DEX-DEX 5 have been assayed for cell permeability. At 1 &mgr;M DEX-FK506 and 10 &mgr;M DEX-DEX, DEX-DEX 1, but not DEX-DEX 5, decreases lacZ transcription in the yeast three-hybrid system by 50%. These results show that a DEX-DEX molecule is cell permeable and retains the ability to bind to GR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The protein chimeras are varied in four ways: (1) invert the orientation of the B42 activation domain and the receptor; (2) introduce tandem repeats of the receptor; (3) introduce (GlyGlySer)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>linkers between the protein domains; (4) vary the DNA-binding domain and the transcription activation domain. We expect these experiments to be carried out over the next two years. The motivation for these experiments is that many different protein fusions have been reported in the literature and these types of modifications have been shown to be critical in these previous experiments. We have designed each of these experiments so that multiple variations can be made simultaneously. Inverting the orientation so that the receptor, not B42, is N-terminal is trivial. We will construct a generic vector that can be used with different receptors. Likewise, since several different DNA-binding domains and activation domains have been used with the yeast two-hybrid system, it is not difficult to vary these domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> An approach to introducing tandem repeats of the receptor and (GlyGlySer) n linkers that allows us to make multiple constructs simultaneously is provided. As illustrated for GR, the approach to making tandem repeats of the receptor is to use restriction enzymes with compatible cohesive ends (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). The same PCR product can then be used to introduce each receptor unit. By including a BamHI restriction site immediately 5&prime; to the gene encoding GR, a series of (GlyGlySer)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>linkers can be introduced essentially as described. This approach relies on the fact that the BamHI site, GGA-TCC, encodes Gly-Ser. This combined approach will allow for the construction of multiple protein chimeras simultaneously. Since a lacZ screen us used, all of these constructs can be assayed simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Design of Reporter Genes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> A reporter gene assay measures the activity of a gene&apos;s promoter. It takes advantage of molecular biology techniques, which allow one to put heterologous genes under the control of a mammalian cell (Gorman, C. M. et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 2: 1044-1051 (1982); Alam, J. And Cook, J. L., Anal. Biochem. 188: 245-254, (1990)). Activation of the promoter induces the reporter gene as well as or instead of the endogenous gene. By design the reporter gene codes for a protein that can easily be detected and measured. Commonly it is an enzyme that converts a commercially available substrate into a product. This conversion is conveniently followed by either chromatography or direct optical measurement and allows for the quantification of the amount of enzyme produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Reporter genes are commercially available on a variety of plasmids for the study of gene regulation in a large variety of organisms (Alam and Cook, supra). Promoters of interest can be inserted into multiple cloning sites provided for this purpose in front of the reporter gene on the plasmid (Rosenthal, N., <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymo. </italic></highlight>152: 704-720 (1987); Shiau, A. and Smith, J. M., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>67: 295-299 (1988)). Standard techniques are used to introduce these genes into a cell type or whole organism (e.g., as described in Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. Expression of cloned genes in cultured mammalian cells. In: <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning</italic></highlight>, edited by Nolan, C. New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Resistance markers provided on the plasmid can then be used to select for successfully transfected cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Ease of use and the large signal amplification make this technique increasingly popular in the study of gene regulation. Every step in the cascade DNA&rarr;RNA&rarr;Enzyme&rarr;Product&rarr;Signal amplifies the next one in the sequence. The further down in the cascade one measures, the more signal one obtains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In an ideal reporter gene assay, the reporter gene under the control of the promoter of interest is transfected into cells, either transiently or stably. Receptor activation leads to a change in enzyme levels via transcriptional and translational events. The amount of enzyme present can be measured via its enzymatic action on a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Host Cell </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The host cell for the foregoing screen may be any cell capable of expressing the protein or cDNA library of proteins to be screened. Some suitable host cells have been found to be yeast cells, <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> This invention will be better understood from the Experimental Details which follow. However, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific methods and results discussed are merely illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims which follow thereafter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> We have shown that Dex-Mtx can dimerize a LexA-DHFR and a B42-rGR protein chimera in vivo (Table I). (Lin, 1999) Dex-Mtx was assayed using both plate and liquid assays at extracellular concentrations of 1-100 &mgr;M. No activation was observed at concentrations &lE;0.1 &mgr;M. 100 &mgr;M is the limit of Dex-Mtx solubility. Control experiments established that lacZ transcription is dependent on Dex-Mtx. There are only background levels of lacZ transcription when Dex-Mtx is omitted, LexA-DHFR is replaced with LexA, or B42-GR is replaced with B42. Likewise, a 10-fold excess of Mtx competes out Dex-Mtx-dependent lacZ transcription. Interestingly, of the 10 protein chimera combinations tested, Dex-Mtx could only activate lacZ transcription in the context of the LexA-eDHFR and the B42-(Gly6)-rGR chimeras (Table 1). None of the 9 other protein combinations tested worked. This result is consistent with our view that the Dex-Mtx systems (and other dimerization systems) could be further improved both by biochemical and structural characterization and by variation of the protein chimeras and the reporter.

<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Cephalosporin Hydrolysis by the 908R Cephalosporinase in the Yeast Three-Hybrid System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The subject invention is exemplified using the components of the yeast three-hybrid system (Licitra, represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). In this system DEX-FK506 (exemplifying H1-H2) mediates dimerization of the protein fusions LexA-GR (representing reporter V-H1 receptor) and B42-FKBP12 (representing reporter W-H2 receptor) thus activating transcription of a lacZ reporter gene. The chemical handles H1 and H2 and the protein dimerization assay, however, all can be varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In the subject invention, however, the yeast three-hybrid system is altered by inserting a BOND, B, as well as any required spacers X and Y, so as to form a small molecule having the structure H1-X-B-Y-H2. While there is ample precedent for small-molecule mediated protein dimerization, what remains is to show these assays can be used to select for catalysts. Cephalosporin hydrolysis by a cephalosporinase provides a simple cleavage reaction to demonstrate the selection (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The BOND, B in this example is cephem linkage susceptible to attack by cephalosporinase, such that hydrolysis of the cephalosporinase results in separation of the proteins and deactivation of the transcription of lacZ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><italic>E. cloacae </italic></highlight>908R cephalosporinase is well characterized both biochemically (Galleni; Galleni; Galleni; Monnaie) and structurally (Lobkovsky) and is simple to manipulate. Several approaches have been developed for modifying cephalosporin antibiotics at the C7&prime; and C3&prime; positions to improve their pharmacokinetic properties and to prepare pro-drugs. (Druckheimer; Albrecht; Vrudhula; Meyer) Cephalosporin hydrolysis by the cephalosporinase can disrupt protein dimerization and hence be used to discriminate between cells containing active and inactive enzyme. Specifically, (1) (C.)DEX-CEPHEM-(C3&prime;)FK506 is synthesized; (2) DEX-CEPHEM-FK506 is shown to dimerize LexA-GR and B42-FKBP12 and both DEX and FK506 is shown to disrupt the dimerization; (3) induction of the wild type cephalosporinase, but not an inactive Ser<highlight><superscript>64 </superscript></highlight>variant, is shown to disrupt cephem-mediated protein dimerization; and (4) cells containing active cephalosporinase are identified based on loss of protein dimerization in a mock screen. A screen for loss of lacZ transcription is sufficient for the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The retro-synthesis of DEX-CEPHEM-FK506 is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>; it allows H1, H2, and the linker molecules to be varied. The allelic chloride intermediate 2 has been synthesized from cephem 1 in 20% yield in four steps. Mild conditions for coupling H2-SH to the allelic chloride 2 using sodium iodide have been developed; DEX-SH can be coupled in 82% yield. 908R cephalosporinase variants have been constructed both with and without nuclear-localization sequences under control of GALL and MET25 promoters. All of these variants are known to be active in vivo by using the chromogenic substrate nitrocefin, (Pluckthun). Several <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>strains suitable for this model reaction have been constructed. DEX-FK506 is know to dimerize LexA-rGR and B42-FKBP12 in these strain backgrounds (yeast three-hybrid system). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> All of the components needed for the proof of principle have been prepared. Specifically, we have developed a modular synthesis of Dex-cephem-Mtx and constructed a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>strain suitable for the proof principle. The retro-synthesis of Dex-cephem-Dex is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>; it allows H1, H2, and the linker molecules to be varied to optimize the cephem substrate. We have synthesized the allylic chloride intermediate 2 from cephem 1 in 20% yield in four steps. We have developed mild conditions for coupling H2-SH to the allylic chloride 2 using sodium iodide; Dex-SH can be coupled in 82% yield. We have constructed strain FY250/pMW106/pMW2rGR2/pMW3FKBP12 and shown that Dex-FK506 can still mediate dimerization of LexA-rGR and B42-FKBP12 in this strain. The strain provides an additional marker for the enzyme, grows well on galactose and raffinose, and replaces all of the amp<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>markers with kan<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>or spec<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>markers. In addition, we have constructed several constructs for the galactose- or methionine-regulated overexpression of the cephalosporinase. Based on hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate nitrocefin, (Pluckthun, 1987) we have shown that the cephalosporinase is active in the FY250 background. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The basis for catalysis by the cephalosporinase is studied using combinatorial techniques. Understanding the mechanism is important for anticipating future routes to antibiotic resistance and for developing new cephalosporin antibiotics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Dex-cephem-Mtx Induces Protein Dimerization in Vivo </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Preparation of a Dex-cephem-Mtx (cleavable cephem linker) The cephem substrates were designed such that introduction of the Dex and Mtx ligands would not interfere with cephalosporinase hydrolysis of the cephem core and so that a variety of Dex-cephem-Mtx substrates could be synthesized readily from commercially available materials. (The chemistry of the b-lactams; Durckheimer; Albrecht; Meyer; Zlokarnik) We synthesized four potential Dex-cephem-Mtx substrates from a commercial amino- chloro- cephem intermediate. Dexamethasone was coupled to the C7 amino group of the cephem core via aminocarboxylic acids of different lengths, and methotrexate to the C3&prime; chloro group via aminothiols of different lengths. All four compounds were prepared from three components in 3-4 steps in 10-30% overall yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The critical issue was whether introduction of the cephem linker would impede either the cell permeability or the dimerization activity of the Dex-Mtx CID. We screened all four Dex-cephem-Mtx compounds using the yeast two-hybrid lacZ transcription assay and determined that all four compounds are cell permeable and that two of these compounds are capable of inducing protein dimerization in vivo, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Based on these results, it appears that the length of the linkers between the cephem core and the Dex and Mtx ligands are important; the cephem core must not be too close to the receptor or it will prevent access to the receptor. These results support the general feasibility of preparing CIDs with cleavable linkers and using these compounds in viva with the catalysis screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The ability of this Dex-cephem-MTX CID to serve as a read-out for catalysis is evaluated using the well-studied enzymatic reaction, cephem hydrolysis by a cephalosporinase. Hydrolysis of the lactam bond results in expulsion of the leaving group at the C3&prime; position, effectively breaking the bond between Dex and Mtx.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Having identified Dex-cephem-Mtx substrates that are efficient dimerizers in the yeast two-hybrid assay, the next step is to demonstrate that the screen can discriminate between active and inactive enzymes. The penicillin-binding protein (PBP) from Streptomyces R61 provides a good control &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; enzyme to compare to the active Q908R cephalosporinase. (Kelly; Ghuysen) Cephalosporinases are believed to have evolved from PBPs.(Ghuysen; Knox) Both enzymes have the same three-dimensional fold and follow the same catalytic mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate. (Kelly, Lobkovsky) PBPs bind to cephems with high affinity, form the acyl-enzyme intermediate rapidly, but hydrolyze the acyl-enzyme intermediate much more slowly than do Cephalosporinases. We have introduced both the Q908R cephalosporinase and the R61 PBP into yeast shuttle vectors that place the enzymes under control of either a galactose-inducible or a methionine-repressible promoter. Based on plate assays using the chromagenic substrate nitrocefin, (Pluckthun) the Q908R enzyme was expressed in an active form in yeast with either promoter. This assay cannot detect PBP activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The Dex-cephem-Mtx CID screen distinguish between the cephalosporinase and the PBP. Yeast strains containing the cephalosporinase hydrolyze the cephem linkage rapidly, disrupting lacZ transcription. The PBP, on the other hand, hydrolyze the cephem linkage too slowly to change the levels of lacZ transcription significantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Can the CID Screen Detect Catalytic Activity&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Strong support for the feasibility of using CIDs with cleavable linkers to detect catalytic activity is provided by in vivo selections for protease activity based on cleavage of internal protease sites engineered in a variety of proteins, including Gal4. With an active Dex-cephem-Mtx CID in hand, our next step is to find conditions where the CID screen gives an enzyme-dependent signal. We envision two scenarios which should result in an enzyme-dependent signal: (1) overexpression of the enzyme relative to the LexA- and B42-reporter proteins and (2) expression of the enzyme prior to expression of the LexA- and B42-reporter proteins. The Brent Y2H vectors currently employed in the lab will have to be modified to allow for control over the levels and timing of LexA- and B42-expression. As supplied, the Brent vectors have the LexA fusion protein under control of the strong, constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (PADH) and the B42 fusion protein under control of the strong galactose-inducible promoter (PGAL). Both vectors contain the high-copy yeast 2&mgr; origin of replication. We plan simply to place the LexA fusion protein under control of a galactose-inducible promoter, just like B42. The GAL promoter is the most tightly regulated promoter available in yeast and is induced by galactose and repressed by glucose. It can be fully repressed, and it can direct expression of a range of intermediate protein concentrations by varying the relative percentages of glucose and galactose in the growth media. Thus, with both LexA and B42 under control of Gal promoters, these reporter proteins can be turned off and then on or expressed at intermediate concentrations in concert. If this approach does not work, there are many other ways to tune the sensitivity of the system. The expression of the enzyme, LexA, and B42 can all be controlled using other inducible or constitutive promoters or by integrating LexA and B42 into the chromosome. The lacZ reporter gene can be replaced with other chromagenic reporters or selectable markers. Alternatively, the sensitivity of the system can be tuned by varying the substrate:product ratio by adding both Dex-cephem-Mtx (substrate) and Dex and Mtx (&ldquo;product&rdquo;) to the growth media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Once conditions were found where we can detect enzyme-dependent cleavage of the cephem linker, we carried out a mock screen as a proof-of-principle experiment. Specifically, plasmids encoding the cephalosporinase and the PBP in a ratio of 1:99 will be introduced into a yeast strain carrying the appropriate protein chimera and reporter genes. Cells harboring the cephalosporinase should be white, while those containing the PBP should be blue. Plasmids from these colonies will be isolated and sequenced to confirm the identity of the expressed enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Level of Catalytic Activity Detected Using the CID Screen </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> While these experiments will show that the CID screen can detect catalytic activity, they will not show that the screen can be used to amplify enzymes with low levels of catalytic activity. Thus, our next step is to use cephalosporinase mutants with a range of catalytic efficiencies to quantify and then optimize the sensitivity of the system. Many b-lactamase mutants, either found in clinical settings or constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, have been fully characterized kinetically. Known mutants of the Q908R cephase, the <highlight><italic>E. cloacae </italic></highlight>P99 cephase (99% identical), and the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>K12 AmpC b-lactamase (71% homologous) are available spanning a wide range of k<highlight><subscript>cat</subscript></highlight>, K<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>, and k<highlight><subscript>cat</subscript></highlight>/K<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>values (Table II). To accurately gauge the relative activities of the mutants in the CID and amp<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>screens, we will determine kinetic rate constants for the corresponding Q908R cephase variants with the Dex-cephem-Mtx and ampicillin substrates and nitrocefin as a control. The Q908R cephase variants will be constructed in the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>expression vector by site-directed mutagenesis, using a PCR-based method. These proteins will then be purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, and rate constants will be determined by UV spectroscopy, monitoring the disappearance of absorbance due to the b-lactam bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> After determining the activity of the mutants with Dex-cephem-Mtx and ampicillin in vitro, these same mutants are tested in the CID and ampR screens. In addition to plate and more quantitative liquid lacZ assays, the mutants will be evaluated using a ura3 reporter gene. Ura3, which encodes orotidine-5&prime;-phosphate decarboxylase and is required for uracil biosynthesis, is used routinely as a selectiable marker in yeast. Since large numbers of protein variants need to be screened for the evolution experiments, it will be important to move from a screen to a growth selection. Ura3 has the advantage that it can be used both for positive and negative selections-positive for growth in the absence of uracil and negative for conversion of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to 5-fluorouracil, a toxic byproduct. Cleavage of the cephem bond and disruption of ura3 transcription will be selected for based on growth in the presence of 5-FOA. The advantage to the 5-FOA selection is that the timing of addition of both the Dex-cephem-Mtx substrate and 5-FOA can be controlled. Several other reporter genes, however, have been reported. The mutants are evaluated in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>using nitrocefin screens and amp<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>selections. Mutants with higher activity (k<highlight><subscript>cat</subscript></highlight>/K<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>) will still show an enzyme-dependent signal (failure to hydrolyze X-gal or growth in the presence of 5-FOA/nitrocefin hydrolysis or resistance to ampicillin), but at some point these assays will not be able to detect the less active mutants. In addition to suggesting what range of activities can be detected with these assays, these experiments may bring surprising results. For example, it may be that detection correlates more strongly with k<highlight><subscript>cat </subscript></highlight>than with K<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>or k<highlight><subscript>cat</subscript></highlight>/K<highlight><subscript>M</subscript></highlight>. Assuming a dynamic range of &gt;1000, we will proceed with the enzyme evolution experiments. Otherwise, we will focus on optimizing the sensitivity of the screen until we reach this level of sensitivity. The optimization experiments will continue along the same lines as the proof-of-principle experiments, varying the levels and timing of both protein expression and addition of the substrate and product, except they will be carried out with mutant cephases at the limit of detection.

Each strain was constructed from the parent yeast strain FY250 and also contains the pMW106 plasmid, which has the LacZ reporter gene that is turned on only in when the LexA DNA binding domain and the B42 activation are brought in tot he vicinity of each other. We use several different strains because we use DHFR from two different species, mDHFR is from murine, while eDHFR is from <highlight><italic>E.coli</italic></highlight>. We are asl oable to switch the small moleculebinding domains. For example, the strain containing LexA-eDHFR with B42-rGH2 is a different strain and behaves differently from the strain containing LexA-rGR2 with B42-eDHFR. We also put in short 6 amino acid linkers between the two domains of our protein chimeras and thus these are different strain as well. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Using CIDs with structurally diverse carbohydrate linkers, we screen a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>CDNA library based on glycosidase activity.

Glycoproteins are synthesized by modification of a core glycoside. The GlcNAcb1&reg;Asn and GlcNAcb1&reg;4GlcNAc linkages in Asn-linked carbohydrates are cleaved by peptide-N<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>- (N-acetyl-b-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase (PNGase F) and endo-b-N-acetylglucosaminidases (Endo H and Endo F1), respectively. &lsqb;Tarentino, 1990; Tarentino, 1992; Robbins, 1984; Trimble, 1991&rsqb; Since each of these enzymes are endo-glycosidases, the CID ligands should not interfere with the enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The diversity of naturally occuring carbohydrates requires us to make a library of Dex-Mtx CIDs with different carbohydrate linkers. Recent advances in the synthesis of oligosaccharides, both in the coupling methods&lsqb;Schmidt, 1986; Toshima, 1993; Boons, 1996&rsqb; and in the solid-phase synthesis,&lsqb;Danishefsky, 1993; Seeberger, 1998; Yan, 1994; Liang, 1996&rsqb; make it possible to synthesize these linkers. We have chosen to use a method developed by Kahne and co-workers which uses anomeric sulfoxides as glycosyl donors and synthesizes carbohydrates from the reducing to the non-reducing end.&lsqb;Yan, 1994; Liang, 1996&rsqb; This method can be used both in solution and on solid-support, can form both a- and b-glycosidic bonds, and utilizes readily-synthesized intermediates. Several alternative methods, however, are available, including Wong and co-workers&apos; one-pot solution synthesis&lsqb;Zhang, 1999; Ye, 2000&rsqb; and the solid-phase glycal strategy reported by Danishefsky and co-workers.&lsqb;Danishefsky, 1993; Seeberger, 1998&rsqb;</paragraph>

Concurrently, we identify glycosidases from a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisae </italic></highlight>cDNA library by screening for cleavage of CIDs with glycosidic linkages. The Dex-Mtx yeast two-hybrid assay is used as the screen by replacing Dex-Mtx with Dex-oligosaccharide-Mtx.

<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The first step of both the chitinase control and the random oligosaccharide library is to introduce a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>cDNA library into the CID selection strain. We use a cDNA library reported by Fields and co-workers. &lsqb;Martzen, 1999&rsqb; In this library, each cDNA clone is expressed as a GST-fusion protein under control of a copper-inducible promoter on a shuttle vector with a leu2 marker.&lsqb;Martzen, 1999; J. R. Hudson, 1997&rsqb; Transformation efficiencies in yeast are ca. 10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>-10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>using the lithium acetate method, so there is ample redundancy to screen all 6,000 ORFs in <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>. Active clones can be identified by sequencing the plasmid. For the chitinase control experiment, we make a library with a subset of cDNA clones to test different approaches for expressing the cDNA clones. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> We begin by screening a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>cDNA library for a known glycosidase, chitinase. Chitinase hydrolyzes chitin, polymers of b-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) that play a structural role in the cell.&lsqb;Muzzarelli, 1977&rsqb; Chitinases from several organisms, including <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>, have been cloned and characterized.&lsqb;Correat, 1982; Kuranda, 1987; Kuranda, 1991&rsqb; It is known that this enzyme can hydrolyze oligomers of b-1,4-GlcNAc ranging from trimers to heterogeneous polymers, suggesting that CIDs such as Dex-(GlcNAc) -Mtx should be efficient substrates for this enzyme. Several efficient syntheses of &bgr;-1,4-linked GlcNAc have been published.&lsqb;Banoub, 1992&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The retro-synthetic analysis of our Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx CID substrate is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> The growing carbohydrate chain is linked to the solid support via the Glu portion of Mtx. The glycosidic linkages are formed essentially as reported by Kahne and co-workers using sulfoxide glycosyl donors.&lsqb;Yan, 1994; Liang, 1996&rsqb; The final carbohydrate is introduced as a Dex derivative, and the Mtx synthesis is completed prior to cleavage from the solid support. This synthesis allows the oligosaccharide linker to be varied and both the Dex and the Mtx ligand to be introduced before cleavage from solid support. Alternatively, the synthesis can be carried out in solution,&lsqb;Kahne, 1989&rsqb; or other methods for carbohydrate synthesis can be employed.&lsqb;Zhang, 1999; Ye, 2000; Danishefsky, 1993; Seeberger, 1998 We start with a GlcNAc tetramer as trimers have been shown to be the shortest efficient substrates for chitinases.&lsqb;Watanabe, 1993&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Initially, lacZ plate assays are used to verify that the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrates are efficient dimerizers in the yeast three-hybrid assay. The results with Dex-cephem-Mtx support the feasibility of incorporating structurally diverse linkers into the CIDs. If the initial chitinase substrates, however, are not efficient dimerizers, the linkers between the CID ligands and the GlcNAc oligomer can be varied, or alternate dimerization assays can be tested. Since large numbers of cDNA clones need to be screened, the transcriptional read-out of the yeast three-hybrid assay may be changed from a screen to a growth selection. Specifically, ura3, which encodes orotidine-5&prime;-phosphate decarboxylase and is required for uracil biosynthesis, replaced lacZ as the reporter gene. &lsqb;Boeke, 1984&rsqb; Ura3 has the advantage that it can be used both for positive and negative selections-positive for growth in the absence of uracil and negative for conversion of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to 5-fluorouracil, a toxic byproduct. Cleavage of the glycosidic bond and disruption of ura3 transcription is selected for based on growth in the presence of 5-FOA. The advantage to the 5-FOA selection is that the timing of addition of both the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate and 5-FOA can be controlled. Several other reporter genes, however, can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> One problem that has the potential of occurring is that the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate becomes unstable either because of its intrinsic half-life in water or because it is turned over by cellular glycosidases. However, if the substrate has a short half-life in water, the assay conditions can be modified so that the substrate is added late in the assay after the cells have grown to a high density, the substrate can be continuously replenished, or the pH of the media can be buffered. Turnover by cellular glycosidases can simply be seen as an assay in and of itself. Using traditional genetic approaches, random mutations can be introduced into the S. cerevisiae genome or the tagged knock-out strains of Winzeler et al. can be used.&lsqb;Winzeler, 1999&rsqb; Cells containing a disruptive mutation in the gene or genes cleaving the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate can be selected for by growth in the absence of uracil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The final step is to use the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate to pull out chitinase from a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>cDNA library. As described above, a 5-FOA growth selection is used to screen the Fields cDNA library. In the absence of chitinase, Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx induces ura3 transcription, and 5-FOA is converted to the toxic byproduct 5-fluorouracil. Thus, only cells containing active chitinase, or another enzyme that can cleave the substrate, survive. The cDNA clone is readily identified by isolating the plasmid, sequencing the N-terminus of the clone, and comparing this sequence to that of the <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>genome. The advantage of using a known enzyme is that the enzyme can be tested independently or used to spike the cDNA library. The enzyme can be purified, and the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate can be tested in vitro. We can vary the format of the cDNA library, the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate, the screen, or the assay conditions, or even use a different glycosidase as a control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Can Glycosidases be Identified from the &gt;3000 Unassigned ORFs in <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>Using the CID Selection&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The next step is to determine the activity of the &gt;3000 ORFs in <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>with unknown function. To detect glycosidase activity, the screen is run exactly as with the chitinase control except using Dex-oligosaccharide-Mtx substrates with different glycosidic linkages. The glycosidic linkages is based on the types of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates naturally occuring in yeast. Several activities, including amylase, &lsqb;Sogaard, 1993; Vihinen, 1990; Qian, 1994; Wiegand, 1995; Fujimoto, 1998; Wilcox, 1984&rsqb; xylanase,&lsqb;Wong, 1988; Biely, 1997; Georis, 1999&rsqb; and endo-N-acetylglucosamine hydrolysis activity,&lsqb;Tarentino, 1990; Tarentino, 1992; Robbins, 1984; Trimble, 1991&rsqb; can be targeted specifically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Dex-Mtx CIDs with different oligosaccharide linkers are prepared using the same strategy as for the chitinase substrate (above). The sulfoxide glycosyl donor method for carbohydrate synthesis allows a variety of sugar monomers to be introduced. &lsqb;Kahne, 1989&rsqb; Moreover, both the regio- and stereo-chemistry can be controlled. &lsqb;Yan, 1994; Liang, 1996&rsqb; As with the chitinase control, the 5-FOA growth selection is used to identify enzymes that cleave the various glycosidic linkages. Each glycoside subsrate is tested individually. Mixtures of substrates cannot be tested because the uncleaved substrates would continue to activate ura3 transcription. If the screen does not pick up any enzymes, known glycosidases from other organisms may be used as controls both for the growth selections and to test the Dex-Mtx substrates in vitro. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> the foregoing permits the characterization of in vitro activity and biological function of glycosidases identified using the CID screen. Similarly, CDNA libraries from other organisms can be screened. The Dex-Mtx substrates can be used to evolve glycosidases with unique specificities. In addition, the cDNA screen can be extended to other classes of enzymes, such as proteases. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Development of CID with a Suicide Substrate (&ldquo;Covalent CID&rdquo;) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and the accompanying discussion, 4 non-covalent interactions have to take place simultaneously for the reporter protein to be activated. Specifically, 1) the DNA-binding protein-DNA interaction, 2) the 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>ligand-receptor interaction, 3) the 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>ligand-receptor interaction, and 4) the activation domain-transcription machinery interaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> However, it is possible to replace the 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>ligand-receptor pair (Dex-GR in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) with a small molecule-receptor pair that will form an irreversible covalent linkage, making a system with only 3 non-covalent interactions. Such an approach allows for the screening of small molecules to identify their cellular targets. This covalent CID system is used for screening the ligand receptor interaction, which used to be laborious work by using the photo cross linking, radio labeled ligand binding and affinity chromatography techniques. The covalent system is more sensitive than the Dex-Mtx system because the covalent bond gives zero k<highlight><subscript>off </subscript></highlight>for the covalent ligand-protein binding pair and then the cut-off Kd of the whole system is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> The covalent CID system is constructed by the same principles as other CID, except that one of the ligand-receptor pairs is selected so that in vivo the pair is fixed by a covalent bond and the cell read-out will be depended on the other ligand-receptor interaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The covalent CID should find broad use anytime a covalent linkage between the ligand and receptor increases the efficacy of the system. The ligand might be a small molecule, e.g. a drug, and the target may be a protein responsible for the drugs efficacy or for unwanted toxic side effects. The small molecule may also be a cofactor or hormone and the goal might be to screen a genomic library to identify proteins that bind to the given cofactor or hormone. In both cases, the covalent CID allows not only high affinity (nM), but also moderate affinity (&mgr;M), interactions to be detected. Reasonable targets for covalent CIDs include suicide substrate-enzyme pairs, which in this example are Fluorouracil-Thymidylate Synthase and Cephen-Penicillin Binding Protein.

<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The above two suicide substrate/enzyme pairs are selected because they are stable at physiological pH and activated toward covalent modification only in the enzyme active-site. In addition, an antibiotic-bacterial enzyme pair have the advantage that they can readily be transferred to mammalian cells without toxicity effects. Furthermore, as show in our PCT International Publication No. WO 01/53355, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, Dex-cephem-Mtx CIDs are cell permeable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> In this example we use cephem and Streptomyces R61 penicillin binding protein to generate this covalent bond. The reaction between &bgr;-lactam compounds and the penicillin binding protein is well studied, and the R61 enzyme is well-characterized biochemically and structurally (Kuzin et al, 1995; Kelly, 1995). The synthesis of &bgr;-lactam compounds is well established also. The Mtx-eDHFR ligand-small molecule pair is kept is this new system because this pair has higher affinity and better small molecule cell permeability than the Dex-rGR ligand-receptor pair. The cephem-Mtx CID shown below is synthesized by analogy to our syntheses of Dex-cephem-Mtx, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> The haploid strains of are mated, resulting in diploid strains that contain the pMW103, the pMW102 and the reporter plasmid, or some permutation thereof. The yeast strains are phroged to SC(H-U-T-)/galactose/raffinose liquid media in 96-well plates and incubated in a 30&deg; C. shaker for two days and then phroged to X-gal plates, and X-gal plates with 1 mM Mtx-cephem. The plates are incubated at 30&deg; C. for two days. The colonies of cells having the plasmid being selected for (for example: the strain which has R61-LexA fusion protein, DHFR-B42 fusion protein, and the pMW106 reporter gene) turn blue on the Mtx-cephem X-gal plate, but are white on the general X-gal plate. The positive control (yeast two hybrid system) and negative control (lacking one of the fusion proteins) is used during the experiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Comparison between the covalent CID system and the Dex-Mtx CID system shows that covalent CID system gives positive results at lower CID concentrations. Any mutation on the DHFR gene that lowers the affinity of the DHFR protein to Mtx results in a negative result in the Dex-Mtx CID system, but a positive result in the covalent CID system. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> cDNA Binding Screen: Steroids </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> We can Screen proteins from cDNA libraries based on binding activity using a modified yeast-three hybrid assay. The screening of cDNA libraries method is based on function. The advantage of this method is that it is straightforward using existing technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> Initially we synthesize several, e.g. 5-10, CID&apos;s each comprising a methotrexate moiety covalently linked to a different steroid. These steroid-Mtx CIDs are screened against a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>two-hybrid library where DBD-DHFR is held constant and AD-cDNA library is the variable. Each time a given steroid binds to a given <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>protein, the reporter gene should be activated. The steroid-Mtx analogs can be chosen at will, and are their synthesis is known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> First, we test Dexamethasone-Mtx, primarily because Dex has a common A-ring. Second, we synthesize different steroids with common A-ring structures. We have chosen to focus on varying A-rings because, 1) natural steroids often differ primarily in their A-rings, 2) it allows us to use the same chemistry to synthesize all of the steroid-analogs, and 3) there are many examples of natural steroid-receptor complexes where the A-ring is buried in the protein-binding pocket, while the D-ring can be derivatized without disrupting receptor binding. Specifically, we synthesize Steroid-Mtx CIDs based on the steroids Dexamethasone, Estrone, Progesterone, Cholesterol, and Lanosterol. These steroids are chosen because they have representative A-rings and because they play important physiological roles (Lanosterol specifically in yeast): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> To simplify the chemistry, steroids that retain similar A/B/C rings, but have one of two D rings, may be used. Specifically, such steroids are 3P-Hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid (Aldrich), Eburicolic acid (Aplin Chemicals), Progesterone (Aldrich), Estrone (Aldrich), and Dexamethasone (Aldrich). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> If any steroid is not available as a carboxylic acid, it can be converted to a carboxylic acid by the representative scheme shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> These carboxylic acids will then be coupled to methotrexate by analogy to the synthesis of Dex-Mtx in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> In addition to the dihalo linker shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, we synthesize the Steroid-Mtx CIDs with the linker 1,10-diiododecane, which has also been successfully used to make Dex-Mtx. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Screens </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> These CID&apos;s are screened against a yeast ORF library fused to an activation domain using the yeast three-hybrid screen. This screen can be done using technology already in place at GPC-Biotech. We should start screening immediately with Dex-Mtx to work out any bugs while we are preparing the other Steroid-Mtx compounds. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to high throughput screening of cDNA libraries. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The majority of known proteins were identified using traditional genetics or biochemistry. The availability of complete genome sequences for several organisms and the anticipation of the completion of the human genome project effectively make thousands of new proteins &ldquo;known&rdquo;. The problem, however, is that while thousands of new open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified, the functions of these proteins remain a mystery. Sequence analysis is a powerful predictor of protein function, but many ORFs cannot be assigned by sequence analysis and experimental characterization is still required to ascertain protein function. There is tremendous interest in high-throughput approaches for testing cDNA libraries, which include thousands of unique ORFs, using genetic or biochemical screens. The hurdles are the same as in all high-throughput screening applications. First, cDNA libraries must be available in a format that is compatible with screening technologies and that allows rapid identification of individual cDNAs. Second, high-throughput screens must be developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Commercial cDNA libraries, tissue-specific cDNA libraries, and even cell-cycle-specific cDNA libraries from a variety of organisms are readily available. Over the past few years, these cCNA libraries have been adapted to several formats amenable to high-throughput screening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Expression cloning relies on split-pool in vitro transcription/translation and has the advantage that it is compatible with many traditional biochemical assays. Winzler et al. used homologous recombination to engineer 2026 unique yeast strains&mdash;each containing a knock-out of a different ORF and replacing that ORF with a unique 20 base-pair tag. Several laboratories have reported specific yeast two-hybrid cDNA libraries, and many of these libraries are even distributed commercially (Clontech). Martzen et al. constructed 6144 individual yeast strains where each strain expresses a unique <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>ORF-GST fusion protein under control of the P<highlight><subscript>CUP1 </subscript></highlight>promoter. Because of the facility of homologous recombination in <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>, these cDNA libraries were prepared simply by co-transforming the cDNA library with the appropriate linearized vector. Thus, replicating these expression formats with different cDNA libraries is routine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The most common traditional genetic selection is lethality, or synthetic-lethality. A variety of phenotype-specific screens have also been employed. However, most of these are too time consuming for screening cDNA libraries. A few phenotype-specific selections have been reported. Screens and selections designed for the high-throughput screening of cDNA libraries have also been reported. One of the major applications envisioned for the yeast two-hybrid assay is the screening of cDNA libraries for protein-protein interactions. The success of the yeast three-hybrid assay suggests that it should also be possible to screen cDNA libraries for small-molecule-protein interactions. Another approach is to screen for changes in expression levels of individual cellular RNAs. In Genetic Footprinting, random Ty1 transposon insertions in genomic DNA are used as markers for changes in the expression levels of endogenous RNAs based on reverse transcription and gel electrophoresis. The use of unique oligonucleotide tags rather than Ty1 transposon insertions facilitates rapid identification of individual RNAs. DNA microarrays, in which oligonucleotides corresponding to each individual ORF are synthesized on chips in a spatially-resolved format, have been used successfully in a number of recent applications. A recent report in which expression cloning identified a new family of uracil-DNA glycosylases from a Xenopus cDNA library based on in vitro binding assays suggests the importance of screening based on biochemical activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> What is missing is a general method for screening cDNA libraries based on function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Screens have been developed based on small-molecule inducible gene expression. Several systems for small-molecule inducible gene expression have been developed to the point that they are integral to basic research. The discovery that the lac operon is induced by binding of lactose to the lac repressor led to the wide spread use of isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to induce gene expression in bacteria. More recently it has been shown that by fusing the tet repressor to a eukaryotic transcription activation domain, gene expression in eukaryotes can be both negatively and positively regulated using tetracycline. (Gossen 1992, Gossen 1995) The demonstration that transgene expression can be regulated with tetracycline in transgenic mice highlights the utility of this system. In addition to the tetracycline-based system, ecdysone-, (No) estrogen-,(Braselman) and progesterone-regulated systems (Wang) have been reported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An extension of these strategies resulted from studies of the mechanism of action of the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. (Rosen) It was found that the biological activity of both compounds resulted from the fact that they each dimerize two proteins, FKBP12 and calcineurin and FKBP12 and FRAP, respectively, that otherwise do not interact. One portion of FK506 binds to FKBP12 and another to calcineurin. Based on this understanding, it was demonstrated that these molecules could be used to control protein oligomerization inside a cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Molecules such as FK506 are small molecule &lsquo;dimerizers&rsquo; (sometimes referred to as chemical inducers of dimerization, CIDs) that activate the function of numerous proteins that regulate many important cellular processes. Dimerizers allow the functions of proteins to be explored even when small molecule ligands are unknown. A limited number of such reagents have been synthesized that control the function of a much larger number of proteins (expressed as fusions of proteins of interest linked to a small molecule-responsive dimerization domain). See, e.g. Austin 1994, Belshaw 1996, Choi 1996, Crabtree 996, Diver 1997, Ho 1996, Holsinger 1995, Hung 1996, Klemm 1998, Liberles 1997, Pruschy 1994, Schreiber 1998, Spencer 1996, Spencer 1995, Spencer 1993, Stockwell 1998, and Yang 1998. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To generalize this approach, it was shown in 1993 that two FK506 molecules tethered via their C<highlight><subscript>21</subscript></highlight>-allyl groups could oligomerize proteins fused to FKBP12. Specifically, several FK506 dimers termed &ldquo;FK1012s&rdquo; were shown to oligomerize the cytoplasmic domain of T-cell receptors when these domains were fused to the FK506-binding protein FKBP12. Since this initial paper, there have been several important extensions of this work by Schreiber and coworkers. Belshaw et al. reported in 1996 that two different proteins could be dimerized by tethering FK506 to cyclosporin. In 1997 Diver and Schreiber demonstrated a two-step synthesis of an FK1012 molecule based on recent olefin metathesis chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> While this work with FK506 establishes a powerful new approach for manipulating cellular function with small molecules, optimized chemical handles that are more convenient to work with than is FK506 are critical for realizing the potential of this approach. FK506 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>) is cell permeable and has excellent pharmacokinetic properties&mdash;as evidenced by its widespread use as an immunosuppressant. FK506, however, is not an ideal chemical handle. FK506 is not available in large quantities, coupling via the C<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>allyl group requires several chemical transformations including silyl protection of FK506,(Spencer; Pruschy) and FK506 is both acid and base sensitive. (Wagner 1998; Coleman 1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One very recent approach to replacing FK506 is to design synthetic ligands that also bind to FKBP12 with high affinity. In 1997 Amara et al. reported AP1510, a synthetic dimerizer that binds FKBP12 with high affinity and that can oligomerize proteins fused to FKBP12. Very recently a derivative of AP1510, &ldquo;5S&rdquo;, was prepared that binds with high affinity to a FKBP12 mutant. (Clackson) This derivative is particularly interesting because it does not bind with high affinity to wild type FKBP12. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Recently a system has been reported, named the yeast three-hybrid system, for detecting ligand-receptor interactions in vivo. (Licitra, represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) This system is based on the principle that small ligand-receptor interactions underlie many fundamental processes in biology and form the basis for pharmacological intervention of human diseases in medicine. This system is adapted from the yeast two-hybrid system with which a third synthetic hybrid ligand is combined. The feasibility of this system was demonstrated using as the hybrid ligand a dimer of covalently linked dexamethasone and FK506. The system used yeast expressing fusion proteins of the hormone binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain and of FKBP12 fused to a transcriptional activation domain. When the yeast was plated on medium containing the dexamethasone-FK506 heterodimer, the reporter genes were activated. The reporter gene activation is completely abrogated in a competitive manner by the presence of excess FK506. Using this system, a screen was performed of a Jurkat cDNA library fused to the transcriptional activation domain in yeast expressing the hormone binding domain of rat glucocorticoid receptor/DNA binding domain fusion protein in the presence of a methasone-FK506 heterodimer. Overlapping clones of human FKBP12 were isolated. These results demonstrate that the three-hybrid system can be used to discover receptors for small ligands and to screen for new ligands to known receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Other approaches, which do not rely on a readout based on alterations in genetic expression, have also been developed. WO 96/30540 (Tsien et al.) discloses a screen for &bgr;-lactamase activity that uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer as the indicator of &bgr;-lactamase activity. The degree of fluorescence in this screen depends on the level of &bgr;-lactamase activity. Detection of &bgr;-lactamase activity relies on detection of changes in the degree of fluorescence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, it has not heretofore been suggested to use small molecule induced protein dimerization by CID&apos;s with non-cleavable linkers to screen cDNA libraries based on binding, or cleavable linkers to screen cDNA libraries based on catalysis. This invention provides the ability to screen cDNA libraries based on binding or catalysis, in conjunction with CID technology. A cDNA library can be screened for all proteins that bind to a molecule or catalyze a specific reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The CID technology offers a promising approach to screening cDNA libraries based on function because a variety of activities can be assayed simply by changing on of the CID ligand/receptor pairs or by changing the bond between the CID ligands. It is a significant advantage that this is a cell-based assay-the proteins can be tested in vivo, and the DNA encoding the proteins can be sequenced directly. Recent efforts to sequence entire genomes have created a tremendous need for high-throughput methods for determining protein function. While thousands of new genes have been identified based on sequence, their function remains unkown. For example, &gt;3000 open reading frames in the yeast <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>-over half of the genome-have no assigned function. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The determination of the binding specificity of biomolecules is important not only for understanding the mechanisms and pathways of biological systems, but also because this binding specificity provides information for the future development of therapeutic and diagnostic agents. This invention describes a cell-based assay for detecting binding activities of steroids to better understand their in vivo molecular recognition. Steroid hormones are essential for the regulation of salts and water in the body, for metabolism, and for the maturation and sexual development of males and females. Moreover, the development of several kinds of cancer has been linked directly to steroids as causative agents. Due to the necessary role that steroids play in bodily functions, it is important to learn about their interactions with cellular targets to understand how they demonstrate this dual behavior. The screen builds from existing technology for dimerizing proteins within cells, using chemical inducers of dimerization (&ldquo;CID&rdquo; or &ldquo;CIDs&rdquo;). By using a steroid as one of the ligands of the dimeric small-molecule CIDs, binding can be detected. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Selection Strategy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The selection strategy is based on existing methods for controlling protein dimerization in vivo using small molecules (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Several &ldquo;chemical inducers of dimerization&rdquo; have been reported showing that protein dimerization can be bridged by small molecules. (Spencer; Crabtree) Moreover, a number of techniques exist for translating the dimerization of two proteins to an in vivo screen or selection. (Hu 1990; Hu 1995; Fields; Gyuris; Johnsson; Rossi; Karimova) Taken together, this work establishes that it is feasible to use a small molecule H1-H2 to dimerize two fusion protein, reporter V-H1 receptor and reporter W-H2 receptor, generating a cellular read-out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Disclosed a general method for screening a cDNA library based on the ability of members of that library to express a proein capable of binding to H1 or H2 or an ability of that protein to catalyze a reaction to either form or cleave the covalent coupling between H1 and H2. That is, the small-molecule H1-X-BOND-Y-H2 represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is used to mediate protein dimerization and hence a cellular signal. Then the polypepetide enzyme that binds to either H1 or H2 is selected. The selection is tied to the cellular &ldquo;read-out&rdquo; because only cells containing the polypeptide which binds will have the desired phenotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The strategy is both general and a direct selection for polypeptides which bind. The selection can be applied to a broad range of polypeptides because protein dimerization depends only on the H1 and H2 selected. It is a direct selection for the polypeptides because binding of H1 and H2 is necessary for protein dimerization. Also, this strategy does not limit the starting protein scaffold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Preparation and Design of Handles &ldquo;H1&rdquo; and &ldquo;H2&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Ideally, a chemical handle should bind its receptor with high affinity (&lE;100 nM), cross cell membranes yet be inert to modification or degradation, be available in reasonable quantities, and present a convenient side-chain for routine chemical derivatization that does not disrupt receptor binding. Again, we build from DEX-FK506 (H1-H2) mediated dimerization of LexA-rGR and B42-FKBP12 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) (Licitra). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Dexamethasone (DEX) is a very attractive chemical handle H1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). DEX binds rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with a K<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of 5 nM, (Chakraborti) can regulate the in vivo activity and nuclear localization of GR fusion proteins (Picard), and is commercially available. Affinity columns for rGR have been prepared via the C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>&prop;-hydroxy ketone of dexamethasone. (Govindan; Manz) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The antibacterial and anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) is used in place of FK506 as the chemical handle H2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B, 5C</cross-reference>) FK506 is not available in large quantities, coupling via the C<highlight><subscript>21 </subscript></highlight>allyl group requires several chemical transformations including silyl protection of FK506, (Spencer; Pruschy) and FK506 is both acid and base-sensitive. (Wagner; Coleman) MTX, on the other hand, is commercially available and can be modified selectively at its &ggr;-carboxylate without disrupting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) binding. (Kralovec; Bolin) Even though MTX inhibits DHFR with pM affinity, (Bolin; Sasso) both <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>grow in the presence of MTX when supplemented with appropriate nutrients. (Huang) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The ability of DEX-MTX to mediate the dimerization of LexA-rGR and B42-DHFR is tested by (1) synthesis of a series of DEX-MTX molecules with simple diamine linkers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>); and (2) showing that DEX-MTX can dimerize LexA-rGR and B42-DHFR based on lacZ transcription and that both DEX and MTX uncoupled, can, competitively disrupt this dimerization. Cell permeable chemical handles that can be prepared readily and that are efficient at inducing protein dimerization not only are essential to the robustness of this selection methodology but also should find broad use as chemical inducers of protein dimerization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Dexamethasone (DEX) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) present a particularly attractive chemical handle/receptor pair. Dexamethasone is the cortical steroid with the highest affinity for the rat Glucocorticoid Receptor. The rGR binds DEX with a K<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of 5 nM, and mutants of rGR have been isolated with up to 10-fold higher affinity for DEX. (Chakraborti) The steroid dexamethasone has been used extensively as a cell-permeable small molecule to regulate the in vivo activity and nuclear localization of GR fusion proteins. (Picard) This work firmly establishes that DEX is cell permeable and is not modified or broken down in the cell. Recently, there has been one report of a yeast &ldquo;three-hybrid&rdquo; system in which a GR-DNA-binding protein fusion and a FKBP12-transcription activation domain fusion could be dimerized by the small molecule DEX-FK506 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Dexamethasone is commercially available in large quantities. Affinity columns for rGR have been prepared via oxidation of the C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>a-hydroxy ketone of DEX to the corresponding carboxylic acid. (Govindan, Manz) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Methotrexate (MTX) inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is one of the textbook examples of high-affinity ligand binding. The interaction between MTX and DHFR is extremely well characterized both biochemically and structurally. DHFR is a monomeric protein and binds MTX with picomolar affinity. (Bolin, Sasso) Even though MTX inhibits DHFR with such high affinity, both <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>grow in the presence of MTX when supplemented with appropriate nutrients. (Huang) The ability of MTX to serve both as an antibacterial and an anticancer agent is clear evidence that MTX has excellent pharmacokinetic properties. MTX is known to be imported into cells via a specific folate transporter protein. MTX is commercially available and can be synthesized readily from simple precursors. MTX can be modified selectively at its g-carboxylate without disrupting its interaction with DHFR. (Kralovec, Bolin) There are several examples reported where MTX has been modified via its g-carboxylate to prepare affinity columns and antibody conjugates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Given the number of cellular pathways that depend on cascades of dynamic protein-protein interactions, the ability to regulate protein oligomerization in vivo with small molecules should have broad applications in medicine and basic science. The key to realizing the potential of these small molecules both for the catalysis screen in the laboratory and for these biomedical applications is developing H1-H2 molecules that can be prepared readily and are efficient at inducing protein dimerization in vivo. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> It has been found that the combination of the Mtx moiety containing CID with DHFR binding domain containing fusion protein is a highly useful and widely applicable. Mtx and the DHFR receptor present a particularly attractive chemical handle/receptor pair. In addition to having a picomolar binding affinity, the complex of an Mtx moiety and the DHFR binding domain is extremely well characterized. The excellent pharmacokinetic properties of Mtx make it an ideal moiety to be used in procedures where ease of importation into cells is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Linking H1 and H2 Through a Linker </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> To illustrate how the handles H1 and H2 may be linked together, several of the DEX-DEX compounds that have been synthesized to date are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The linkers are all commercially available or can be prepared in a single step. The linkers vary in hydrophobicity, length, and flexibility. a series of DEX-DEX molecules have been synthesized (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). The DEX-DEX molecules shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> were prepared from Dexamethasone and the corresponding diamines. The C<highlight><subscript>20 </subscript></highlight>a-hydroxy ketone of dexamethasone was oxidized using sodium periodate to the corresponding carboxylic acid in quantitative yield as described. The diamines are commercially available. The diamine corresponding to DEX-DEX 2 was prepared from a,a&prime;-dibromo-m-xylene and aminoethanethiol and used crude. The diamines were coupled to the carboxylic acid derivative of dexamethasone using the peptide-coupling reagent PyBOP under standard conditions in 60-80% yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> We have synthesized a DEX-MTX molecule. The retrosynthesis is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The synthesis is designed to be modular so that we can easily bring in a variety of linkers in one of the final steps as the dibromo- or diiodo-derivatives. For synthetic ease, the glutamate residue has been replaced with homocysteine. This replacement should be neutral because there is both biochemical and structural evidence that the g-carboxylate of methotrexate can be modified without disrupting DHFR binding. The final compound has been synthesized in 12 steps in 1.3% overall yield. Also synthesized are analogous compounds where the a,a&prime;-dibromo-m-xylene linker is replaced with 1,5-diiodopentane or 1,10-diiododecane. A similar route is used to prepare MTX-MTX molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Design of the Protein Chimeras </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The second important feature is the design of the protein chimeras. The yeast two-hybrid assay was chosen in the examples because of its flexibility. Specifically, the Brent two-hybrid system is used, which uses LexA as the DNA-binding domain and B42 as the transcription activation domain. The Brent system is one of the two most commonly used yeast two-hybrid systems. An advantage of the Brent system is that it does not rely on Gal4 allowing use of the regulatable Gal promoter. lacZ under control of 4 tandem LexA operators are used as the reporter gene. Initially, we chose to make simple LexA-GR and DHFR and B42-GR and DHFR fusion proteins that do not depart from the design of the Brent system. In the Brent system, the full length LexA protein which includes both the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain is used. The B42 domain is a monomer. The C-terminal hormone-binding domain of the rat Glucocorticoid Receptor is chosen because this domain was shown to work previously in the yeast three-hybrid system reported by Licitra, et al. Both the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and the murine DHFRs are used because these are two of the most well characterized DHFRs. The <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>protein has the advantage that methotrexate binding is independent of NADPH binding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Construction of the LexA- and B42-receptor fusions is facilitated by the availability of commercial vectors for the Brent two-hybrid system. These vectors are shuttle vectors that can be manipulated both in bacteria and yeast. The LexA chimera is under control of the strong, constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. The B42 chimera is under control of the strong, regulatable galactose promoter. Both the GR and the two DHFR genes were introduced into the multiple cloning sites of the commercial LexA and B42 expression vectors using standard molecular biology techniques. The GR fusions are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The available restriction sites result in a three amino acid spacer between the two proteins in both the GR and the DHFR constructs. The plasmids encoding the LexA- and B42-fusion proteins were introduced in all necessary combinations into <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>strain FY250 containing a plasmid encoding the lacZ reporter plasmid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Three initial assays are conducted: (1) toxicity of the ligand and receptor, (2) cell permeability of the H1-H2 molecules as judged by competition in the yeast three-hybrid system, and (3) activation of lacZ transcription by the H1-H2 molecule as judged by X-gal hydrolysis. All of these experiments have been done as plate assays. The toxicity of the ligand and receptor is judged simply by seeing if either induction of the receptor fusions or application of the ligand to the plate impairs cell growth. Cell permeability is assessed based on the ability of an excess of DEX-DEX or DEX-MTX to disrupt DEX-FK506 induction of lacZ transcription in the yeast three-hybrid system. An excess of DEX-DEX or DEX-MTX should bind to all of the available LexA-GR chimera and disrupt transcription activation so long as the molecule is cell permeable and retains the ability to bind to GR. Effective protein dimerization by H1-H2 is assayed by activation of lacZ transcription. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The DEX-DEX molecules is tested by all three assays. Preliminary results show that neither DEX nor GR are toxic. Under the conditions tried thus far, none of the DEX-DEX molecules tested are efficient at protein dimerization as judged by the lacZ transcription assay. We have been able to repeat the yeast three-hybrid result&mdash;activation of lacZ transcription using DEX-FK506, in our lab. DEX-DEX 1 and DEX-DEX 5 have been assayed for cell permeability. At 1 &mgr;M DEX-FK506 and 10 &mgr;M DEX-DEX, DEX-DEX 1, but not DEX-DEX 5, decreases lacZ transcription in the yeast three-hybrid system by 50%. These results show that a DEX-DEX molecule is cell permeable and retains the ability to bind to GR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The protein chimeras are varied in four ways: (1) invert the orientation of the B42 activation domain and the receptor; (2) introduce tandem repeats of the receptor; (3) introduce (GlyGlySer)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>linkers between the protein domains; (4) vary the DNA-binding domain and the transcription activation domain. We expect these experiments to be carried out over the next two years. The motivation for these experiments is that many different protein fusions have been reported in the literature and these types of modifications have been shown to be critical in these previous experiments. We have designed each of these experiments so that multiple variations can be made simultaneously. Inverting the orientation so that the receptor, not B42, is N-terminal is trivial. We will construct a generic vector that can be used with different receptors. Likewise, since several different DNA-binding domains and activation domains have been used with the yeast two-hybrid system, it is not difficult to vary these domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> An approach to introducing tandem repeats of the receptor and (GlyGlySer)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>linkers that allows us to make multiple constructs simultaneously is provided. As illustrated for GR, the approach to making tandem repeats of the receptor is to use restriction enzymes with compatible cohesive ends (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). The same PCR product can then be used to introduce each receptor unit. By including a BamHI restriction site immediately 5&prime; to the gene encoding GR, a series of (GlyGlySer)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>linkers can be introduced essentially as described. This approach relies on the fact that the BamHI site, GGA-TCC, encodes Gly-Ser. This combined approach will allow for the construction of multiple protein chimeras simultaneously. Since a lacZ screen us used, all of these constructs can be assayed simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Design of Reporter Genes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> A reporter gene assay measures the activity of a gene&apos;s promoter. It takes advantage of molecular biology techniques, which allow one to put heterologous genes under the control of a mammalian cell (Gorman, C. M. et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 2: 1044-1051 (1982); Alam, J. And Cook, J. L., Anal. Biochem. 188: 245-254, (1990)). Activation of the promoter induces the reporter gene as well as or instead of the endogenous gene. By design the reporter gene codes for a protein that can easily be detected and measured. Commonly it is an enzyme that converts a commercially available substrate into a product. This conversion is conveniently followed by either chromatography or direct optical measurement and allows for the quantification of the amount of enzyme produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Reporter genes are commercially available on a variety of plasmids for the study of gene regulation in a large variety of organisms (Alam and Cook, supra). Promoters of interest can be inserted into multiple cloning sites provided for this purpose in front of the reporter gene on the plasmid (Rosenthal, N., <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymo. </italic></highlight>152: 704-720 (1987); Shiau, A. and Smith, J. M., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>67: 295-299 (1988)). Standard techniques are used to introduce these genes into a cell type or whole organism (e.g., as described in Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. Expression of cloned genes in cultured mammalian cells. In: <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning</italic></highlight>, edited by Nolan, C. New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Resistance markers provided on the plasmid can then be used to select for successfully transfected cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Ease of use and the large signal amplification make this technique increasingly popular in the study of gene regulation. Every step in the cascade DNA&rarr;RNA&rarr;Enzyme&rarr;Product&rarr;Signal amplifies the next one in the sequence. The further down in the cascade one measures, the more signal one obtains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In an ideal reporter gene assay, the reporter gene under the control of the promoter of interest is transfected into cells, either transiently or stably. Receptor activation leads to a change in enzyme levels via transcriptional and translational events. The amount of enzyme present can be measured via its enzymatic action on a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Host Cell </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The host cell for the foregoing screen may be any cell capable of expressing the protein or cDNA library of proteins to be screened.

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> This invention will be better understood from the Experimental Details which follow.

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> We have shown that Dex-Mtx can dimerize a LexA-DHFR and a B42-rGR protein chimera in vivo (Table I). (Lin, 1999) Dex-Mtx was assayed using both plate and liquid assays at extracellular concentrations of 1-100 &mgr;M. No activation was observed at concentrations &lE;0.1 &mgr;M. 100 &mgr;M is the limit of Dex-Mtx solubility. Control experiments established that lacZ transcription is dependent on Dex-Mtx. There are only background levels of lacZ transcription when Dex-Mtx is omitted, LexA-DHFR is replaced with LexA, or B42-GR is replaced with B42. Likewise, a 10-fold excess of Mtx competes out Dex-Mtx-dependent lacZ transcription. Interestingly, of the 10 protein chimera combinations tested, Dex-Mtx could only activate lacZ transcription in the context of the LexA-eDHFR and the B42-(Gly6)-rGR chimeras (Table 1). None of the 9 other protein combinations tested worked. This result is consistent with our view that the Dex-Mtx systems (and other dimerization systems) could be further improved both by biochemical and structural characterization and by variation of the protein chimeras and the reporter.

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Cephalosporin Hydrolysis by the 908R Cephalosporinase in the Yeast Three-Hybrid System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The subject invention is exemplified using the components of the yeast three-hybrid system (Licitra, represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). In this system DEX-FK506 (exemplifying H1-H2) mediates dimerization of the protein fusions LexA-GR (representing reporter V-H1 receptor) and B42-FKBP12 (representing reporter W-H2 receptor) thus activating transcription of a lacZ reporter gene. The chemical handles H1 and H2 and the protein dimerization assay, however, all can be varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In the subject invention, however, the yeast three-hybrid system is altered by inserting a BOND, B, as well as any required spacers X and Y, so as to form a small molecule having the structure H1-X-B-Y-H2. While there is ample precedent for small-molecule mediated protein dimerization, what remains is to show these assays can be used to select for catalysts. Cephalosporin hydrolysis by a cephalosporinase provides a simple cleavage reaction to demonstrate the selection (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The BOND, B in this example is cephem linkage susceptible to attack by caphalosporinase, such that hydrolysis of the cephalosporinase results in separation of the proteins and deactivation of the transcription of lacZ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><italic>E. cloacae </italic></highlight>908R cephalosporinase is well characterized both biochemically (Galleni; Galleni; Galleni; Monnaie) and structurally (Lobkovsky) and is simple to manipulate. Several approaches have been developed for modifying cephalosporin antibiotics at the C7&prime; and C3&prime; positions to improve their pharmacokinetic properties and to prepare pro-drugs. (Druckheimer; Albrecht; Vrudhula; Meyer) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Cephalosporin hydrolysis by the cephalosporinase can disrupt protein dimerization and hence be used to discriminate between cells containing active and inactive enzyme. Specifically,(1) (C.)DEX-CEPHEM-(C3&prime;)FK506 is synthesized; (2) DEX-CEPHEM-FK506 is shown to dimerize LexA-GR and B42-FKBP12 and both DEX and FK506 is shown to disrupt the dimerization; (3) induction of the wild type cephalosporinase, but not an inactive Ser<highlight><superscript>64 </superscript></highlight>variant, is shown to disrupt cephem-mediated protein dimerization; and (4) cells containing active cephalosporinase are identified based on loss of protein dimerization in a mock screen. A screen for loss of lacZ transcription is sufficient for the screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The retro-synthesis of DEX-CEPHEM-FK506 is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>; it allows H1, H2, and the linker molecules to be varied. The allelic chloride intermediate 2 has been synthesized from cephem 1 in 20% yield in four steps. Mild conditions for coupling H2-SH to the allelic chloride 2 using sodium iodide have been developed; DEX-SH can be coupled in 82% yield. 908R cephalosporinase variants have been constructed both with and without nuclear-localization sequences under control of GAL1 and MET25 promoters. All of these variants are known to be active in vivo by using the chromogenic substrate nitrocefin, (Pluckthun). Several <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>strains suitable for this model reaction have been constructed. DEX-FK506 is know to dimerize LexA-rGR and B42-FKBP12 in these strain backgrounds (yeast three-hybrid system). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> All of the components needed for the proof of principle have been prepared. Specifically, we have developed a modular synthesis of Dex-cephem-Mtx and constructed a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>strain suitable for the proof principle. The retro-synthesis of Dex-cephem-Dex is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>; it allows H1, H2, and the linker molecules to be varied to optimize the cephem substrate. We have synthesized the allylic chloride intermediate 2 from cephem 1 in 20% yield in four steps. We have developed mild conditions for coupling H2-SH to the allylic chloride 2 using sodium iodide; Dex-SH can be coupled in 82% yield. We have constructed strain FY250/pMW106/pMW2rGR2/pMW3FKBP12 and shown that Dex-FK506 can still mediate dimerization of LexA-rGR and B42-FKBP12 in this strain. The strain provides an additional marker for the enzyme, grows well on galactose and raffinose, and replaces all of the amp<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>markers with kan<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>or spec<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>markers. In addition, we have constructed several constructs for the galactose- or methionine-regulated overexpression of the cephalosporinase. Based on hydrolysis of the chromagenic substrate nitrocefin, (Pluckthun, 1987) we have shown that the cephalosporinase is active in the FY250 background. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The basis for catalysis by the cephalosporinase is studied using combinatorial techniques. Understanding the mechanism is important for anticipating future routes to antibiotic resistance and for developing new cephalosporin antibiotics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Dex-cephem-Mtx Induces Protein Dimerization In Vivo </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Preparation of a Dex-cephem-Mtx (Cleavable Cephem Linker) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The cephem substrates were designed such that introduction of the Dex and Mtx ligands would not interfere with cephalosporinase hydrolysis of the cephem core and so that a variety of Dex-cephem-Mtx substrates could be synthesized readily from commercially available materials. (<highlight><italic>The chemistry of the b</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>lactams</italic></highlight>; Durckheimer; Albrecht; Meyer; Zlokarnik) We synthesized four potential Dex-cephem-Mtx substrates from a commercial amino-chloro-cephem intermediate. Dexamethasone was coupled to the C7 amino group of the cephem core via aminocarboxylic acids of different lengths, and methotrexate to the C3&prime; chloro group via aminothiols of different lengths. All four compounds were prepared from three components in 3-4 steps in 10-30% overall yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The critical issue was whether introduction of the cephem linker would impede either the cell permeability or the dimerization activity of the Dex-Mtx CID. We screened all four Dex-cephem-Mtx compounds using the yeast two-hybrid lacZ transcription assay and determined that all four compounds are cell permeable and that two of these compounds are capable of inducing protein dimerization in vivo, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Based on these results, it appears that the length of the linkers between the cephem core and the Dex and Mtx ligands are important; the cephem core must not be too close to the receptor or it will prevent access to the receptor. These results support the general feasibility of preparing CIDs with cleavable linkers and using these compounds in vivo with the catalysis screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The ability of this Dex-cephem-MTX CID to serve as a read-out for catalysis is evaluated using the well-studied enzymatic reaction, cephem hydrolysis by a cephalosporinase. Hydrolysis of the lactam bond results in expulsion of the leaving group at the C3&prime; position, effectively breaking the bond between Dex and Mtx.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Having identified Dex-cephem-Mtx substrates that are efficient dimerizers in the yeast two-hybrid assay, the next step is to demonstrate that the screen can discriminate between active and inactive enzymes. The penicillin-binding protein (PBP) from Streptomyces R61 provides a good control &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; enzyme to compare to the active Q908R cephalosporinase. (Kelly; Ghuysen) Cephalosporinases are believed to have evolved from PBPs.(Ghuysen; Knox) Both enzymes have the same three-dimensional fold and follow the same catalytic mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate. (Kelly, Lobkovsky) PBPs bind to cephems with high affinity, form the acyl-enzyme intermediate rapidly, but hydrolyze the acyl-enzyme intermediate much more slowly than do cephalosporinases. We have introduced both the Q908R cephalosporinase and the R61 PBP into yeast shuttle vectors that place the enzymes under control of either a galactose-inducible or a methionine-repressible promoter. Based on plate assays using the chromagenic substrate nitrocefin, (Pluckthun) the Q908R enzyme was expressed in an active form in yeast with either promoter. This assay cannot detect PBP activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The Dex-cephem-Mtx CID screen distinguish between the cephalosporinase and the PBP. Yeast strains containing the cephalosporinase hydrolyze the cephem linkage rapidly, disrupting lacZ transcription. The PBP, on the other hand, hydrolyze the cephem linkage too slowly to change the levels of lacZ transcription significantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Can the CID Screen Detect Catalytic Activity&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Strong support for the feasibility of using CIDs with cleavable linkers to detect catalytic activity is provided by in vivo selections for protease activity based on cleavage of internal protease sites engineered in a variety of proteins, including Gal4. With an active Dex-cephem-Mtx CID in hand, our next step is to find conditions where the CID screen gives an enzyme-dependent signal. We envision two scenarios which should result in an enzyme-dependent signal: (1) overexpression of the enzyme relative to the LexA- and B42-reporter proteins and (2) expression of the enzyme prior to expression of the LexA- and B42-reporter proteins. The Brent Y2H vectors currently employed in the lab will have to be modified to allow for control over the levels and timing of LexA- and B42-expression. As supplied, the Brent vectors have the LexA fusion protein under control of the strong, constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (P<highlight><subscript>ADH</subscript></highlight>) and the B42 fusion protein under control of the strong galactose-inducible promoter (P<highlight><subscript>GAL</subscript></highlight>). Both vectors contain the high-copy yeast 2&mgr; origin of replication. We plan simply to place the LexA fusion protein under control of a galactose-inducible promoter, just like B42. The GAL promoter is the most tightly regulated promoter available in yeast and is induced by galactose and repressed by glucose. It can be fully repressed, and it can direct expression of a range of intermediate protein concentrations by varying the relative percentages of glucose and galactose in the growth media. Thus, with both LexA and B42 under control of Gal promoters, these reporter proteins can be turned off and then on or expressed at intermediate concentrations in concert. If this approach does not work, there are many other ways to tune the sensitivity of the system. The expression of the enzyme, LexA, and B42 can all be controlled using other inducible or constitutive promoters or by integrating LexA and B42 into the chromosome. The lacZ reporter gene can be replaced with other chromagenic reporters or selectable markers. Alternatively, the sensitivity of the system can be tuned by varying the substrate:product ratio by adding both Dex-cephem-Mtx (substrate) and Dex and Mtx (&ldquo;product&rdquo;) to the growth media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Once conditions were found where we can detect enzyme-dependent cleavage of the cephem linker, we carried out a mock screen as a proof-of-principle experiment. Specifically, plasmids encoding the cephalosporinase and the PBP in a ratio of 1:99 will be introduced into a yeast strain carrying the appropriate protein chimera and reporter genes. Cells harboring the cephalosporinase should be white, while those containing the PBP should be blue. Plasmids from these colonies will be isolated and sequenced to confirm the identity of the expressed enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Level of Catalytic Activity Detected Using the CID Screen </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> While these experiments will show that the CID screen can detect catalytic activity, they will not show that the screen can be used to amplify enzymes with low levels of catalytic activity. Thus, our next step is to use cephalosporinase mutants with a range of catalytic efficiencies to quantify and then optimize the sensitivity of the system. Many b-lactamase mutants, either found in clinical settings or constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, have been fully characterized kinetically. Known mutants of the Q908R cephase, the <highlight><italic>E. cloacae </italic></highlight>P99 cephase (99% identical), and the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>K12 AmpC b-lactamase (71% homologous) are available spanning a wide range of k<highlight><subscript>cat</subscript></highlight>, K<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>, and k<highlight><subscript>cat</subscript></highlight>/K<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>values (Table II). To accurately gauge the relative activities of the mutants in the CID and amp<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>screens, we will determine kinetic rate constants for the corresponding Q908R cephase variants with the Dex-cephem-Mtx and ampicillin substrates and nitrocefin as a control. The Q908R cephase variants will be constructed in the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>expression vector by site-directed mutagenesis, using a PCR-based method. These proteins will then be purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, and rate constants will be determined by UV spectroscopy, monitoring the disappearance of absorbance due to the b-lactam bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> After determining the activity of the mutants with Dex-cephem-Mtx and ampicillin in vitro, these same mutants are tested in the CID and amp<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>screens. In addition to plate and more quantitative liquid lacZ assays, the mutants will be evaluated using a ura3 reporter gene. Ura3, which encodes orotidine-5&prime;-phosphate decarboxylase and is required for uracil biosynthesis, is used routinely as a selectiable marker in yeast. Since large numbers of protein variants need to be screened for the evolution experiments, it will be important to move from a screen to a growth selection. Ura3 has the advantage that it can be used both for positive and negative selections-positive for growth in the absence of uracil and negative for conversion of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to 5-fluorouracil, a toxic byproduct. Cleavage of the cephem bond and disruption of ura3 transcription will be selected for based on growth in the presence of 5-FOA. The advantage to the 5-FOA selection is that the timing of addition of both the Dex-cephem-Mtx substrate and 5-FOA can be controlled. Several other reporter genes, however, have been reported. The mutants are evaluated in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>using nitrocefin screens and amp<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>selections. Mutants with higher activity (k<highlight><subscript>cat</subscript></highlight>/K<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>) will still show an enzyme-dependent signal (failure to hydrolyze X-gal or growth in the presence of 5-FOA/nitrocefin hydrolysis or resistance to ampicillin), but at some point these assays will not be able to detect the less active mutants. In addition to suggesting what range of activities can be detected with these assays, these experiments may bring surprising results. For example, it may be that detection correlates more strongly with k<highlight><subscript>cat </subscript></highlight>than with K<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>or k<highlight><subscript>cat</subscript></highlight>/K<highlight><subscript>M</subscript></highlight>. Assuming a dynamic range of &gt;1000, we will proceed with the enzyme evolution experiments. Otherwise, we will focus on optimizing the sensitivity of the screen until we reach this level of sensitivity. The optimization experiments will continue along the same lines as the proof-of-principle experiments, varying the levels and timing of both protein expression and addition of the substrate and product, except they will be carried out with mutant cephases at the limit of detection.

<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Glycoconjugates are the most functionally and structurally diverse molecules in natures. &lsqb;Varki, 1993&rsqb; Moreover, it is now well established that carbohydrates and protein- and lipid-bound saccharides play essential roles in many important biological processes, including cell structure, protein targeting, and cell-cell interactions. &lsqb;Varki, 1993&rsqb; Accordingly, glycosidases with a broad array of substrate specificities are required to breakdown and modify polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Using CIDs with structurally diverse carbohydrate linkers, we screen a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>cDNA library based on glycosidase activity. There are many examples of well-characterized glycosidases identified in other organisms that are yet to be identified in <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>. a-Amylase &lsqb;Sogaard, 1993; Vihinen, 1990; Qian, 1994; Wiegand, 1995; Fujimoto, 1998; Wilcox, 1984&rsqb; and xylanase &lsqb;Wong, 1988; Biely, 1997&rsqb; are endo-glycosidases that break down polysaccharides involved in energy storage and cell structure, respectively. Glycoproteins are synthesized by modification of a core glycoside. The GlcNAcb1&reg;Asn and GlcNAcb1&reg;4GlcNAc linkages in Asn-linked carbohydrates are cleaved by peptide-N<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>-(N-acetyl-b-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (PNGase F) and endo-b-N-acetylglucosaminidases (Endo H and Endo F1), respectively. &lsqb;Tarentino, 1990; Tarentino, 1992; Robbins, 1984; Trimble, 1991&rsqb; Since each of these enzymes are endo-glycosidases, the CID ligands should not interfere with the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Likewise, by making a small library of carbohydrate linkers, we screen in an undirected fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> The diversity of naturally occuring carbohydrates requires us to make a library of Dex-Mtx CIDs with different carbohydrate linkers. Recent advances in the synthesis of oligosaccharides, both in the coupling methods &lsqb;Schmidt, 1986; Toshima, 1993; Boons, 1996&rsqb; and in the solid-phase synthesis, &lsqb;Danishefsky, 1993; Seeberger, 1998; Yan, 1994; Liang, 1996&rsqb; make it possible to synthesize these linkers. We have chosen to use a method developed by Kahne and co-workers which uses anomeric sulfoxides as glycosyl donors and synthesizes carbohydrates from the reducing to the non-reducing end. &lsqb;Yan, 1994; Liang, 1996&rsqb; This method can be used both in solution and on solid-support, can form both a- and b-glycosidic bonds, and utilizes readily-synthesized intermediates. Several alternative methods, however, are available, including Wong and co-workers&apos; one-pot solution synthesis &lsqb;Zhang, 1999; Ye, 2000&rsqb; and the solid-phase glycal strategy reported by Danishefsky and co-workers. &lsqb;Danishefsky, 1993; Seeberger, 1998&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> We screen a yeast cDNA library based on glycosidase activity using Dex-Mtx CIDs with cleavable glycosidic linkers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). Concurrently, we identify glycosidases from a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisae </italic></highlight>cDNA library by screening for cleavage of CIDs with glycosidic linkages. The Dex-Mtx yeast two-hybrid assay is used as the screen by replacing Dex-Mtx with Dex-oligosaccharide-Mtx. First, we carry out a control where we screen for a known glycosidase, chitinase, using a defined substrate. Second, we screen for unknown glycosidases by using a small library of substrates with different glycosidic bonds. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The first step of both the chitinase control and the random oligosaccharide library is to introduce a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>cDNA library into the CID selection strain. We use a cDNA library reported by Fields and co-workers. &lsqb;Martzen, 1999&rsqb; In this library, each cDNA clone is expressed as a GST-fusion protein under control of a copper-inducible promoter on a shuttle vector with a leu2 marker. &lsqb;Martzen, 1999; J. R. Hudson, 1997&rsqb; Transformation efficiencies in yeast are ca. 10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>-10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>using the lithium acetate method, so there is ample redundancy to screen all 6,000 ORFs in <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>. Active clones can be identified by sequencing the plasmid. For the chitinase control experiment, we make a library with a subset of cDNA clones to test different approaches for expressing the cDNA clones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Can the <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>Chitinase be Identified Using the CID Selection&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> We begin by screening a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>cDNA library for a known glycosidase, chitinase. Chitinase hydrolyzes chitin, polymers of b-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) that play a structural role in the cell. &lsqb;Muzzarelli, 1977&rsqb; Chitinases from several organisms, including <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></highlight>, have been cloned and characterized. &lsqb;Correat, 1982; Kuranda, 1987; Kuranda, 1991&rsqb; It is known that this enzyme can hydrolyze oligomers of b-1,4-GlcNAc ranging from trimers to heterogeneous polymers, suggesting that CIDs such as Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx should be efficient substrates for this enzyme. Several efficient syntheses of &bgr;-1,4-linked GlcNAc have been published. &lsqb;Banoub, 1992&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The retro-synthetic analysis of our Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx CID substrate is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The growing carbohydrate chain is linked to the solid support via the Glu portion of Mtx. The glycosidic linkages are formed essentially as reported by Kahne and co-workers using sulfoxide glycosyl donors. &lsqb;Yan, 1994; Liang, 1996&rsqb; The final carbohydrate is introduced as a Dex derivative, and the Mtx synthesis is completed prior to cleavage from the solid support. This synthesis allows the oligosaccharide linker to be varied and both the Dex and the Mtx ligand to be introduced before cleavage from solid support. Alternatively, the synthesis can be carried out in solution, &lsqb;Kahne, 1989&rsqb; or other methods for carbohydrate synthesis can be employed. &lsqb;Zhang, 1999; Ye, 2000; Danishefsky, 1993; Seeberger, 1998 We start with a GlcNAc tetramer as trimers have been shown to be the shortest efficient substrates for chitinases. &lsqb;Watanabe, 1993&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Initially, lacZ plate assays are used to verify that the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrates are efficient dimerizers in the yeast three-hybrid assay. The results with Dex-cephem-Mtx support the feasibility of incorporating structurally diverse linkers into the CIDs. If the initial chitinase substrates, however, are not efficient dimerizers, the linkers between the CID ligands and the GlcNAc oligomer can be varied, or alternate dimerization assays can be tested. Since large numbers of cDNA clones need to be screened, the transcriptional read-out of the yeast three-hybrid assay may be changed from a screen to a growth selection. Specifically, ura3, which encodes orotidine-5&prime;-phosphate decarboxylase and is required for uracil biosynthesis, replaced lacZ as the reporter gene. &lsqb;Boeke, 1984&rsqb; Ura3 has the advantage that it can be used both for positive and negative selections-positive for growth in the absence of uracil and negative for conversion of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to 5-fluorouracil, a toxic byproduct. Cleavage of the glycosidic bond and disruption of ura3 transcription is selected for based on growth in the presence of 5-FOA. The advantage to the 5-FOA selection is that the timing of addition of both the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate and 5-FOA can be controlled. Several other reporter genes, however, can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> One problem that has the potential of occurring is that the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate becomes unstable either because of its intrinsic half-life in water or because it is turned over by cellular glycosidases. However, if the substrate has a short half-life in water, the assay conditions can be modified so that the substrate is added late in the assay after the cells have grown to a high density, the substrate can be continuously replenished, or the pH of the media can be buffered. Turnover by cellular glycosidases can simply be seen as an assay in and of itself. Using traditional genetic approaches, random mutations can be introduced into the <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>genome or the tagged knock-out strains of Winzeler et al. can be used. &lsqb;Winzeler, 1999&rsqb; Cells containing a disruptive mutation in the gene or genes cleaving the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate can be selected for by growth in the absence of uracil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The final step is to use the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate to pull out chitinase from a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>cDNA library. As described above, a 5-FOA growth selection is used to screen the Fields cDNA library. In the absence of chitinase, Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx induces ura3 transcription, and 5-FOA is converted to the toxic byproduct 5-fluorouracil. Thus, only cells containing active chitinase, or another enzyme that can cleave the substrate, survive. The cDNA clone is readily identified by isolating the plasmid, sequencing the N-terminus of the clone, and comparing this sequence to that of the <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>genome. The advantage of using a known enzyme is that the enzyme can be tested independently or used to spike the cDNA library. The enzyme can be purified, and the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate can be tested in vitro. We can vary the format of the cDNA library, the Dex-(GlcNAc)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>-Mtx substrate, the screen, or the assay conditions, or even use a different glycosidase as a control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Can Glycosidases be Identified From the &gt;3000 Unassigned ORFs in <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>Using the CID Selection&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The next step is to determine the activity of the &gt;3000 ORFs in <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>with unknown function. To detect glycosidase activity, the screen is run exactly as with the chitinase control except using Dex-oligosaccharide-Mtx substrates with different glycosidic linkages. The glycosidic linkages is based on the types of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates naturally occuring in yeast. Several activities, including amylase, &lsqb;Sogaard, 1993; Vihinen, 1990; Qian, 1994; Wiegand, 1995; Fujimoto, 1998; Wilcox, 1984&rsqb; xylanase,&lsqb;Wong, 1988; Biely, 1997; Georis, 1999&rsqb; and endo-N-acetylglucosamine hydrolysis activity, &lsqb;Tarentino, 1990; Tarentino, 1992; Robbins, 1984; Trimble, 1991&rsqb; can be targeted specifically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Dex-Mtx CIDs with different oligosaccharide linkers are prepared using the same strategy as for the chitinase substrate (above). The sulfoxide glycosyl donor method for carbohydrate synthesis allows a variety of sugar monomers to be introduced. &lsqb;Kahne, 1989&rsqb; Moreover, both the regio- and stereo-chemistry can be controlled. &lsqb;Yan, 1994; Liang, 1996&rsqb; As with the chitinase control, the 5-FOA growth selection is used to identify enzymes that cleave the various glycosidic linkages. Each glycoside subsrate is tested individually. Mixtures of substrates cannot be tested because the uncleaved substrates would continue to activate ura3 transcription. If the screen does not pick up any enzymes, known glycosidases from other organisms may be used as controls both for the growth selections and to test the Dex-Mtx substrates in vitro. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> the foregoing permits the characterization of in vitro activity and biological function of glycosidases identified using the CID screen. Similarly, cDNA libraries from other organisms can be screened. The Dex-Mtx substrates can be used to evolve glycosidases with unique specificities. In addition, the cDNA screen can be extended to other classes of enzymes, such as proteases. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and the accompanying discussion, 4 non-covalent interactions have to take place simultaneously for the reporter protein to be activated. Specifically, 1) the DNA-binding protein-DNA interaction, 2) the 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>ligand-receptor interaction, 3) the 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>ligand-receptor interaction, and 4) the activation domain-transcription machinery interaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> However, it is possible to replace the 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>ligand-receptor pair (Dex-GR in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) with a small molecule-receptor pair that will form an irreversible covalent linkage, making a system with only 3 non-covalent interactions. Such an approach allows for the screening of small molecules to identify their cellular targets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> The small molecule might be a drug and the target may be a protein responsible for the drugs efficacy or for unwanted toxic side effects. The small molecule might be a cofactor or hormone and the goal might be to screen a genomic library to identify proteins that bind to the given cofactor or hormone. In both cases, the covalent CID allows not only high affinity (nM), but also moderate affinity (uM), interactions to be detected. The covalent CID should find broad use anytime a covalent linkage between the ligand and receptor increases the efficacy of the system. Reasonable targets for covalent CIDs include suicide substrate-enzyme pairs, in this example Fluorouracil-Thymidylate Synthase, and Cephen-Penicillin-Binding Protein. </paragraph>

We already have evidence in U.S. Ser. No. 09/490,320, filed Jan. 24, 2000, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, that Dex-cephem-Mtx CIDs are cell permeable. Since Mtx-DHFR variants with a broad range of Kds and kon and koffs are known, we can use these variants to compare the ability of the noncovalent Dex CID and the covalent cephem CID to detect moderate affinity interactions. The cephem and the Mtx-cephem linker can be readily varied and other suicide substrate-enzyme pairs can be evaluated. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> We can Screen proteins from cDNA libraries based on binding activity using a modified yeast-three hybrid assay. The screening of cDNA libraries method is based on function. The advantage of this method is that it is straightforward using existing technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Initially we synthesize several, e.g. 5-10, CID&apos;s each comprising a methotrexate moiety covalently linked to a different steroid. These steriod-Mtx CIDs are screened against a <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>two-hybrid library where DBD-DHFR is held constant and AD-cDNA library is the variable. Each time a given steroid binds to a given <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>protein, the reporter gene should be activated. The steroid-Mtx analogs can be chosen at will, and are their synthesis is known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> First, we test Dexamethasone-Mtx, primarily because Dex has a common A-ring. Second, we synthesize different steroids with common A-ring structures. We have chosen to focus on varying A-rings because, 1) natural steroids often differ primarily in their A-rings, 2) it allows us to use the same chemistry to synthesize all of the steroid-analogs, and 3) there are many examples of natural steroid-receptor complexes where the A-ring is buried in the protein-binding pocket, while the D-ring can be derivatized without disrupting receptor binding. Specifically, we synthesize Steroid-Mtx CIDs based on the steroids Dexamethasone, Estrone, Progesterone, Cholesterol, and Lanosterol. These steroids are chosen because they have representative A-rings and because they play important physiological roles (Lanosterol specifically in yeast): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> To simplify the chemistry, steroids that retain similar A/B/C rings, but have one of two D rings, may be used. Specifically, such steroids are 3&bgr;-Hydroxy-5-cholen-24-oic acid (Aldrich), Eburicolic acid (Aplin Chemicals), Progesterone (Aldrich), Estrone (Aldrich), and Dexamethasone (Aldrich). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> If any steroid is not available as a carboxylic acid, it can be converted to a carboxylic acid by the representative scheme shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to telechelic polymers and methods for making the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to telechelic polymer segments of controlled molecular weight having crosslinkable end groups and methods for preparing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Telechelic polymers can be simply defined as polymers that bear reactive functional groups at their chain termini. The interest in these polymeric materials is derived from the fact that through these reactive end groups, a vast number of macromolecular materials can be prepared. Telechelic polymers have found application in the synthesis of block copolymers, star polymers, cross-linked polymer networks, and ionic polymer networks. Low molecular weight liquid telechelic polymers have been successfully used in reaction injection molding, and the formation of ABA triblock and multiblock copolymers via telechelic polymers has dramatically impacted the development of thermoplastic elastomers. Based on these numerous valuable applications, considerable research efforts have been devoted to improving the synthesis of telechelic polymers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The development of telechelic polymers with crosslinkable end groups such as methacrylate or epoxide groups is of interest for the preparation of interpenetrating polymer networks, AB cross-linked polymeric materials, more thermally and chemically resistant materials, and for the immobilization of biomaterials. However, these reactive end groups have been typically incorporated through a post-polymerization transformation due to the instability of these functional groups to tolerate many of the typical conditions associated with polymerization reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Recently, a non-metathesis-mediated polymer degradation approach was applied to polymers derived from ROMP. Copolymerization of cyclooctadiene (&ldquo;COD&rdquo;) with either cis-4,7-dihydro-1,3-dioxepan (1) or cis-4,7-dihydro-2-phenyl-1,3-dioxepan (2) using well-defined ruthenium-based metathesis initiators, (PCy<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ru&boxH;CHR&prime; (wherein R&prime;&boxH;Ph (3)or wherein R&prime;&boxH;(CH&boxH;CPh<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)(4)), resulted in a polymer bearing both poly(butadiene) and acetal units along the backbone. Subsequent acid hydrolysis of these acetal units resulted in the desired hydroxytelechelic poly(butadiene) (&ldquo;HTPBD&rdquo;) oligomers in moderate yields. Although this method proved to be successful for the synthesis of HTPBD, this method is not generally applicable for the preparation of telechelic polymers with other functional end groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As a result, a need exists for methods for synthesizing telechelic polymers having a variety of end groups, particularly crosslinkable end groups and which does not require post-polymerization transformations for polymer functionalization. </paragraph>

However, it was initially unclear whether a ROMP-type protocol using a chain transfer agent, Z&mdash;Y&boxH;Y&mdash;Z, would be a viable synthetic strategy. Previous mechanistic studies indicated that ruthenium-based metathesis initiators including 3 and 4 were susceptible to a side reaction where the functional end group (e.g. from a chain transfer agent) would chelate to the metal center with a concomitant loss of a L ligand (typically a phosphine). The resulting chelated species were less reactive and often decomposed on the time scale of a typical polymerization reaction. Consequently, whether reactions of ruthenium benzylidene 3 with both 5 and 6 would proceed according to Scheme 4 were investigated.

The polymerizations were run neat according to the different sets of conditions described in Table 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the first two entries, reaction time and temperature were held constant at 24 h and 25&deg; C. while the &lsqb;COD&rsqb;/&lsqb;initiator&rsqb; ratio was increased from 2000:1 to 4000:1. Although only a slight decrease in the yield of 5% was observed, the {overscore (M)}<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>increased from 3500 to 5500 presumably due to a reduced incorporation of the CTA 5 during the polymerization. The impact of reaction time was investigated by comparing the results for reaction times of 24 and 48 hours (at: &lsqb;COD&rsqb;/&lsqb;5&rsqb;&equals;10; &lsqb;COD&rsqb;/&lsqb;initiator&rsqb;&equals;2000; and a temperature of 25&deg; C.). As seen in the third and fourth entries, increasing the reaction time resulted in a slight increase in yield and a lower molecular weight due to an improved incorporation of 5. Unfortunately, the impact of temperature was unable to be investigated because of the relative instability of 5. For example, presumably due to the thermally-induced polymerization of the methacrylate groups, insoluble polymeric materials were formed when polymerizations were run at 45&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Based on these results, all COD polymerization reactions with 5 were run with a &lsqb;COD&rsqb;/&lsqb;initiator&rsqb; ratio of 2000:1 for 48 hours at 25&deg; C. In addition, efforts were taken to minimize photo-induced polymerization of the methacrylate groups by shielding the reaction vesicle from light.

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Despite similar molecular weight values, a lower yield (51% compared to 60%) was observed at the lower initiator loading. As a result, polymerization reactions in the presence of 6 were run at 25&deg; C. and at a 2000:1 &lsqb;COD&rsqb;/&lsqb;initiator&rsqb; ratio. However, unlike the polymerization of COD in the presence of 5, polymerization reactions could be run at higher temperatures because of the relative stability of 6. Comparing entries 3-6 in Table, similar yields and molecular weights were observed regardless of changes in the reaction time or the &lsqb;COD&rsqb;/&lsqb;initiator&rsqb; ratio. Therefore, based on these results, all COD polymerization reactions in the presence of chain transfer agent 6 were carried out at 45&deg; C. with a &lsqb;COD&rsqb;/&lsqb;initiator&rsqb; ratio of 4000:1 for 24 hours. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Cross linking studies of the telechelic poly(butadiene)s 9 and 10 were conducted. Bis(methacrylate)-functionalized telechelic poly(butadiene)s 9 was crosslinked using both thermal and photochemical methods. For thermal cross-linking, concentrated solutions of polymer 9 (100 mg of polymer 9 in 200 &mgr;L toluene) ({overscore (M)}<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>values between 3700 to 17700) were combined with benzoyl peroxide (2 wt %) and heated to 90&deg; C. Within 5 minutes, a tacky insoluble material was observed, and within 15 minutes, a rubbery polymeric solid was formed which was completely insoluble in all common organic solvents including CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, CHCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, benzene, toluene, Et<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, ethyl acetate, and DMSO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Photochemical crosslinking was induced by combining either benzoyl peroxide or 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (2 wt %) with the concentrated polymer solutions and photolyzing the solutions for 15 minutes using a 450 watt medium pressure mercury Hanovia lamp. As in the thermally-induced cross-linking reactions, a tacky insoluble material was formed within 5 minutes and a highly crosslinked rubbery material was obtained after 15 minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Bis(epoxide)-functionalized telechelic poly(butadiene)s 10 was crosslinked using an acid. Solutions of polymer 10 (100 mg of polymer 10 in 500 gL toluene) {overscore (M)}<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>values between 3000 to 16800) were stirred with a magnetic stirrer and treated with H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(cat.).

Treatment with other acids such as HCl (1 M in EtO) and p-toluenesulfonic acid resulted in no significant cross-linking even at elevated temperatures. Treatment of the polymer solutions with BF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-Et<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (cat.) resulted in cross-linking, however the cross-linking required between 2 and 3 hours at room temperature and often gave inconsistent results. Treatment with H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(cat.) was by far the simplest and most rapid method for the cross-linking of the bis(epoxide)-functionalized telechelic poly(butadiene)s 10. </paragraph>

The vial was then capped, removed from the dry box, and left to stir for the desired time. For reactions involving the methacrylate CTA 5, aluminum foil was wrapped around the reaction vial to prevent photo-induced crosslinking. At the end of the desired reaction time, ethyl vinyl ether (600 eq relative to initiator) was pipetted into the vial along with an equal volume of toluene. This was left to stir for 1 h followed by precipitation into MeOH to isolate the polymer. The MeOH was decanted away, and the polymer was washed with excess fresh MeOH to remove any remaining COD or CTA.

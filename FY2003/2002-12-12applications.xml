<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed generally to a method and apparatus for controlling and manipulating small particles, a movable mass or a deformable structure. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for using holographic optical traps to control and manipulate particles and volumes of matter in both general and complex ways. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Optical traps use optical gradient forces to trap, most preferably, micrometer-scale volumes of matter in both two and three dimensions. A holographic form of optical trap can use a computer-generated diffractive optical element to create large numbers of optical traps from a single laser beam. These traps can be arranged in any desired configuration dependent on the need at hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although systems are known to move particles precisely and with a relatively high degree of confidence, conventional systems require a separate hologram to be projected for each discrete step of a particle&apos;s motion. Computing multiple holograms can be very time consuming and requires substantial computational effort. Furthermore, computer-addressable projection systems required to implement such computer-generated optical traps or other dynamic optical trap systems, such as scanned optical tweezers, tend to be prohibitively expensive. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved method for manipulating particles and volumes of matter in both general and complex methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an additional object of the invention to provide an improved method for moving particles along a predetermined path with a high degree of accuracy and confidence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the invention to provide a method for manipulating particles and volumes of matter which removes the computational burden of achieving complex rearrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the above objects, projecting a time varying sequence of such trap patterns makes possible dynamic reconfiguration of traps, with each new pattern updating the position of each trap by a distance small enough that particles trapped in the original pattern naturally fall into a corresponding trap in the next. The present invention therefore offers a method for accomplishing complex rearrangements of matter by cycling through a small number of precalculated holographic optical trap patterns. The cycling can be performed mechanically, removing both computational complexity and the expense of a fully general holographic optical trap system.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Optical peristalsis involves the use of a sequence of pre-calculated holograms projected over time to implement complex redistributions of large numbers of particles over large or selected areas. A key aspect of the invention of optical peristalsis is the non-specific transfer of particles from one manifold of optical traps in a given pattern to the next pattern through the intercession or application of at least two intermediate patterns. The term &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; is meant to encompass at least one manifold. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a typical manifold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of optical traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> arranged in a straight line. Each of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is capable of trapping a particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of interest, and the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are spaced relative to each other so that the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is unlikely to pass through the manifold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> without falling into an available one of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or being blocked by particles already in the trap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is drawn as a sphere, but could just as easily be irregularly shaped, or even much larger than the separation between the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Operation of the optical peristalsis method proceeds by extinguishing the manifold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which frees the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to move. If another pattern of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is illuminated sufficiently nearby, then the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will be trapped by one (or more) of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the new pattern. In the illustrated case of FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D a pattern includes two of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at line <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. However, the next pattern could include only one of the manifolds, along line <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> for example. In effect, the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is thereby transferred from one of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the first pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to another one of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a second pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This process is in its simplist form depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and shown more generally in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D. To effect the transfer of the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the first pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be extinguished first; and then the second pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is illuminated, provided the interval between the two patterns <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is short enough to prevent the trapped particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from &ldquo;wandering off&rdquo; (out of the optical gradient) before it can be captured by the next, nearest available trap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Illuminating the second pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> before extinguishing the first pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> also is another operative embodiment, albeit, more complicated to implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A pattern of the traps can therefore include one or more of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of discrete the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as discrete tweezers in one embodiment of the invention. Each of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can include several of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> arranged along a one-dimensional curve or line, as shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or also on a two-dimensional surface, or within a three-dimensional volume. The notion of a trapping pattern consisting of a collection of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is useful for visualizing the process of optical peristalsis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> shows in further detail one of the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> trapped on one manifold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a particular pattern, labeled as the first pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The first pattern comprises two manifolds <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The positions of trapping the manifolds <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the second extinguished pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (only one manifold for this pattern) and a third extinguished pattern <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (only one manifold) are also shown. In the first time step, only the first pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is illuminated. In the next time step represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the first pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is extinguished and the second pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is illuminated. This action transfers the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the first manifold <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the first pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the nearby manifold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the second pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In the next time incremental step shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, the second pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is extinguished and the third pattern <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is illuminated, thereby transferring the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> again and this time to a manifold <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the third pattern <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the final time step as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>D, the third pattern <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is extinguished and the first pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is illuminated once again. This transfers the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the first pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the next manifold <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Optical peristalsis therefore arises from deterministically transferring the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from one of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on a pattern of the optical traps to another of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the same second pattern <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by cycling through a sequence of intermediate patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a most preferred embodiment of the invention, a minimum of three of the patterns <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are needed to advance the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> deterministically from the one manifold <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on a trapping pattern to the next manifold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. If only two of the equally spaced patterns <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> were used, the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> could have a substantial probability of either advancing to the next manifold <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or returning to the initial manifold <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, more than the three patterns <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be used to transfer a particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in a particular direction. Methods for illuminating and extinguishing the individual manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of optical traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are well understood in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Repeatedly cycling through the first, second and third patterns <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively, tends to move the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from left to right in the arrangement described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Reversing the sequence would drive them right to left. More extensive patterns consisting of more of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thus can be used to transfer the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> back and forth over the entire field of view of the holographic optical trap system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> There are a variety of ways in which optical peristalsis can be used to effect useful rearrangements of collections of the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. These methods include modifying the shapes of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> within a pattern of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by continuous curves. Although a single pattern is described in detail herein, additional intermediate patterns required for transfer between the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would be easily understood and recognized by those skilled in the art. In the examples described herein, the direction of particle flow will be indicated by overlaid arrows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows one of the patterns <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from a linear optical peristaltic pump <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Two or more patterns (not shown) interleaved between the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of this pattern <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be activated in sequence to drive one or more trapped particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from left to right. Reversing the sequence transfers the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from right to left. This pattern, and all of the patterns to be described herein, can be oriented in any desired direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show that patterns consisting of the curved manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be used to concentrate a flow of particles. Conversely, running the same sequence backwards disperses the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This capability would be useful for directing the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> out of an open region and into a confined region, such as a reservoir. It is not necessary that the individual manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have equal curvature, and varying the curvature can be useful in particular situations. For instance, a linear pumping pattern can be used to sweep the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into a focusing pattern. The individual spacings between the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also do not have to be equal. Regions of a pattern with more closely spaced forms of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> tend to transfer particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> more slowly than regions with more widely spaced ones of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The densely packed manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> tend to concentrate the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along the direction of motion, while widely spaced manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be used to spread them out. This approach could be particularly beneficial in a focusing pattern to avoid overcrowding the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as they are concentrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The distribution and density of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> along a manifold also can be used to control the flow of the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> between the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For instance, the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be evenly spaced along each of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and aligned simply from the one manifold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the next and from one pattern to the next. In other embodiments, more complicated arrangements of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> along the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and between patterns can have uses for controlling the flow of particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> along a sequence of patterns. Similarly, varying the intensity, as well as the spacing, of individual traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> along the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a pattern can have useful applications for controlling transport of the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The tendency of the shaped manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to direct the flow of the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can also be used to direct the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into any desired complicated pattern. The example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows the shaped manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> directing one flow of the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into two. When run in reverse, such a pattern could be used to combine two (or more) flows into one. Although this may not be as efficient, because the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from one flow will remain near others from the same flow once the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> merge, the methodology can still be used to advantage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The example shown in FIG. of <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B shows one way to induce mixing of the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from combined flows. This example shows that the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a pattern need not be disjoint. The patterns in this systems include a crossed form of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the mixing regions. Such crossings can be useful for exchanging the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> between the initially distinct flows. Crossing or otherwise intersecting the simple manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to form more complex manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> introduces a probabilistic element into optical peristalsis. The particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are given a choice of directions to travel near each crossing. Which direction the individual particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> choose to follow is determined by random thermal forces at the hand-off from one pattern to the next in a sequence. Hence, the crossings shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference> can lead to a certain degree of mixing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A pattern of closed form of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, can transport the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into or out of a region. Whether the pattern compacts or rarefies the region depends on the order in which the sequence of patterns is projected. The example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is useful for clearing the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> out of a region, such as to facilitate tests on the suspending fluid or measurements on isolated particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Such patterns need not be circular, nor need they be confined to the plane. In principle, two-dimensional forms of the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in three-dimensional patterns can be useful for drawing material into a volume, or pushing material out of a volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it should be noted that competition between optical trapping and other external forces can have useful applications. For example, competition between optical trapping and other external forces could be particularly useful in fractionating the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from a distribution. As an example, it is helpful to consider the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> entrained in a flow of surrounding fluid. Each of the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is transported by viscous drag in the local flow field <custom-character file="US20020185592A1-20021212-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00001"/>(<custom-character file="US20020185592A1-20021212-P00901.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00002"/>) with a force <custom-character file="US20020185592A1-20021212-P00902.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00003"/>&equals;<custom-character file="US20020185592A1-20021212-P00903.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00004"/>determined by its drag coefficient &ggr;. For a sphere of radius a in a fluid of viscosity &eegr;, the drag coefficient is given by &ggr;&equals;6&pgr;&eegr;a and increases linearly with the particle&apos;s radius. A larger particle feels a greater force when held stationary against a flow than a smaller particle. While the force due to viscous drag is one example of an external force, others such as those due to electric or magnetic fields also would pertain in this embodiment described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If the external force is weaker than the optical gradient force of a given one of the optical traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, then the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being transported by optical peristalsis will move much as described hereinbefore. If the external force is greater than the optical gradient force of the optical trap <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, then optical peristalsis may only perturb the motion of the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the external field. In the idealized example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, one type of the particle <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is more strongly attracted to the optical traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> than it is driven by the external field. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> first particle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is more amenable to trapping than a second particle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> or is less strongly influenced by the external field than the second particle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The first particle <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is therefore transported by optical peristalsis and can be collected. The second particle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is more strongly driven by the external field and passes through the pattern of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, perhaps being diverted to a certain extent from its initial course. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The two types of the particles <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in the example embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> are distinguished either by their affinity for the optical traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, by their response to the external field, or both. Choosing the spatial distribution, strength, and other characteristics of the optical traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in such a pattern makes fractionation of particles possible, with the selectivity determined by the particles&apos; differing physical characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The optical fractionation technique has a number of significant advantages. Fractionation occurs along the direction of the applied field in electrophoresis. Optical fractionation can transport the selected fraction laterally. This means that optical fractionation can operate continuously, rather than on one batch at a time. Because optical fractionation relies on holographic optical trap technology, it can be adapted readily to different fractionation problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> For example, multiple stages of optical fractionation can be applied one after another using the same method and apparatus. Tuning each stage to extract a particular fraction of an initially mixed multicomponent sample then will separate the sample into each of its components, conveniently displacing the sorted components laterally away from the flow, and perhaps transporting them to channels or reservoirs using techniques previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The example embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> builds on a single fractionation stage by including a second stage of optical fractionation. The external force driving the particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the region is directed downward. A first pattern, labeled <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, selects particles of first type <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and moves them to the right, diverting, but not collecting particles of second type <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The second stage of fractionation, labeled portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, can feature more intense or more closely spaced examples of the traps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with the ability to divert particles <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the second type <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> away from the external force. As shown, this second stage pattern <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> transports to the left, still further enhancing the separation between the fractions <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Although the two stages of fractionation are presented as conceptually separate, they could be implemented as a single pattern of the optical trap manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This process can also be generalized to include more stages and to incorporate transferring fractionated particles for collection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, optical peristalsis works by repetitively cycling through a sequence of trapping patterns. The dynamic holographic systems represented schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> are a fully general implementation. In this case, a computer-addressed spatial light modulator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> creates the configuration of laser beams <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> needed to implement a given pattern of optical traps <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> by encoded the necessary phase modulation onto the wavefront of an input laser beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In principle, such a system can implement any sequence of trapping patterns, and thus any variant of optical peristalsis. In practice, however, the spatial light modulator <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has physical limitations such as spatial resolution which limit the complexity of the patterns which they encode. Also, such spatial light modulators <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> tend to be costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, optical peristalsis can be performed with the dynamical holographic optical traps <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, a typical implementation of which is shown. An input laser beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is reflected off the surface of the computer-addressed spatial light modulator (SLM) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The SLM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> encodes a computer-generated pattern of phase shifts onto the wavefront of the beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, thereby splitting it into one or more separate laser beams <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, each emanating from point <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in the center of the face of the SLM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Lenses <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> relay each of these laser beams <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to the conjugate point <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at the center of the back aperture of a high NA objective lens <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. This objective lens <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> focuses each of the laser beams <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> into a separate optical trap <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, only one of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> for clarity. A dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> reflects trapping light into the objective lens <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> while allowing imaging illumination to pass through, thereby permitting images to be formed of the particles being trapped. Updating the phase modulation encoded by the SLM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> causes a new pattern of the traps <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to appear. Cycling through a sequence of optical peristalsis patterns in this manner implements the corresponding optical peristalsis process. Because this system can be reconfigured in software, it represents a general implementation of optical peristalsis. In another embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the dynamic holographic optical trap system uses a transmission-mode computer-addressed spatial light modulator <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in an optical train otherwise similar to that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. This system also can be used to implement optical peristalsis by cycling through a sequence of trapping patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Implementing optical peristalsis does not necessarily require the generality and reconfigurability offered by a dynamic holographic optical trap system. Instead, implementing optical peristalsis preferably uses a holographic optical trap system capable of projecting a (small) sequence of otherwise static patterns. In its simplest preferred form, optical peristalsis can be implemented by mechanically cycling through a sequence of phase patterns to implement a corresponding sequence of holographic optical trapping patterns. One particularly useful embodiment appears in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the phase patterns needed to implement a particular optical peristalsis process are encoded in the surface relief of reflective diffractive optical elements <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. These elements <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> are mounted on the face of a prism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and each is rotated into place by a motor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Reversing the motor&apos;s rotation reverses the sequence of patterns and thus the direction of optical peristalsis. Rotating the prism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> with the motor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> orients each of the patterns in the input laser beam so that the diffracted beams created by the aligned diffractive optical elements <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> all create optical traps <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Stepping the motor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> through each of the patterns in sequence implements optical peristalsis. Prisms with more than three patterns can be employed, if desired or necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Mounting a sequence of fixed reflective diffractive optical elements <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> on the face of a rotating prism <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can have other uses in holographic optical trap methodologies. Similarly, transmissive diffractive optical elements <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> can be located on the periphery of a disk <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and rotated into the beam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, or into a reflective optical train in sequence. This also has potential applications beyond optical peristalsis. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, for example, each of the diffractive optical elements <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is rotated into the optical train to project one pattern of the optical peristalsis sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Static reflective or transmissive diffractive optical elements can be fabricated with feature sizes down to the diffraction limit, can have essentially continuous phase encoding, and thus can implement a wider variety of more complicated trapping patterns than can spatial light modulators. Such elements can be produced much more cheaply and do not require a computer to operate. The sequence of patterns in such a system can be changed by changing the prism or disk of diffractive optical elements. In this sense, this implementation is less general than that based on computer-addressed spatial light modulators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Because only a small number of precalculated diffractive optical elements are required to implement optical peristalsis, switchable phase gratings also can be used. The benefits of such an approach include, for example: freedom from moving parts which can drift out of alignment and wear out, the absence of motors which cause vibration and radiate stray electric and magnetic fields, reduction in power requirements and improved compactness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Encoding high-quality phase holograms on film media will allow optical peristalsis to be implemented with the equivalent of film loops. By offering high-speed cycling through large numbers of diffractive optical elements, film-based implementations of holographic optical traps will have applications beyond optical peristalsis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Optical peristalsis also can be useful for particles and other materials such as biological cells which are larger than the physical separation between the traps in an optical peristalsis pattern. Similarly, materials such as proteins, DNA, or molecules could also be manipulated using optical peristalsis. A large object trapped on a &ldquo;bed of nails&rdquo; optical trapping pattern still can be moved by translating the bed of nails. Rather than defining a single trapping region, however, an optical peristalsis pattern can establish a large field of traps suitable for immobilizing a large object wherever it is found. Updating the pattern with small displacements, as described above, then will displace the entire object. Potential applications include translating an extended sample into a region where it can undergo tests, rotating the object for examination, or controllably deforming the object. For example, in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of included optical traps are shown trapping an extended object <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Updating the pattern with the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will tend to rotate the extended object <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Similarly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the manifolds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of optical traps trapping an extended deformable object <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The object <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is more strongly trapped by denser regions of traps, and moving these regions outward in subsequent patterns tends to stretch the object <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Each optical peristalsis sequence performs one specific operation. In some applications, it can be desirable to perform a series of optical peristalsis operations, with the order of the series perhaps depending on the outcome of the preceding operations. For example, optical peristalsis can be used to move a living cell into the center of a microscope&apos;s field of view for reproducible observation. A second sequence then could be engaged to rotate the cell into a desired orientation. Then a third sequence can implement a particular test. Based on the outcome of that test, additional optical peristalsis sequences can be selected to collect the cell or dispose of it. Each of these sequences can be precalculated, thereby removing much of the computational burden from the holographic optical trap system. Similarly, different subsequences of optical peristalsis operations could be incorporated into a single program, wherein a first subsequence could separate particles into two or more distinct flows, a second subsequence could disperse particles from a particular location, a third subsequence could mix two separate streams of particles into a single flow, a fourth subsequence could concentrate a plurality of particles into a particle region, and particles can be &ldquo;moved&rdquo; from pattern to pattern in a variety of other ways as well. A variety of combinations of subsequences such as those described herein could be incorporated into a single program, and these subsequences could be used sequentially and/or simultaneously as needed using a variety of types of optical gradients as described herein. Because very few diffractive optical elements are required to implement any one of the sequences, only modest elaboration of the proposed implementations would be needed to select among a collection of available sequences for such multistage operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it is also possible to practice the present invention without the use of optical traps as conventionally understood to require specific optical gradient conditions to hold a particle. For example, a plurality of deterministic optical gradients can be established and incorporated into a plurality of manifolds and patterns as generally described above. These optical deterministic gradients operate to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; or restrain, but not necessarily form an optical trap, for individual particles in a particular position for a sufficient period of time in sequence to generate an optical peristalsis effect. In other words, repeatedly cycling through first, second, and third patterns of deterministic optical gradients will move individual particles along a designated path. The optical gradients are deterministic in a sense that the conditions that are applied are sufficient to achieve the intended result with more than just a mere probability of success. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects as set forth in the claims provided hereinafter. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Compositions capable of simultaneous two-photon absorption and higher order absorptivities are disclosed. Many of these compositions are compounds satisfying the formulae d-A&mdash;D, A&mdash;A&mdash;A, D&mdash;A&mdash;D and A&mdash;D&mdash;A, wherein D is an electron donor group, A is an electron acceptor group and A comprises a bridge of B-conjugated bonds connecting the electron donor groups and electron acceptor groups. In A&mdash;D&mdash;A and D&mdash;A&mdash;D compounds, the B bridge is substituted with electron donor groups and electron acceptor groups. Also disclosed are methods that generate an electronically excited state of a compound, including those satisfying one of these formulae. The electronically excited state is achieved in a method that includes irradiating the compound with light. Then, the compound is converted to a multi-photon electronically excited state upon simultaneous absorption of at least two photons of light. The sum of the energies of all of the absorbed photons is greater than or equal to the transition energy from a ground state of the compound to the multi-photon excited state. The energy of each absorbed photon is less than the transition energy between the round state and the lowest single-photon excited state of the compound is less than the transition energy between the multi-photon excited state and the ground state. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to materials which exhibit nonlinear absorptive properties. More particularly, the invention relates to materials which have high two-photon or higher-order absorptivities and methods for their use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Molecular two-photon absorption was predicted in G&ouml;ppert-Mayer, M., <highlight><italic>Ann. Phys. </italic></highlight>1931, 9, 273. Upon the invention of pulsed ruby lasers in 1960, experimental observation of two-photon absorption became reality. In years since, multi-photon excitation has found application in biology and optical data storage, as well as in other fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although interest in multi-photon excitation has exploded, there is a paucity of two-photon absorbing dyes with adequately strong two-photon absorption in the correct spectral region for many applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There are two key advantages of two-photon (or higher-order) induced processes relative to single-photon induced processes. Whereas single-photon absorption scales linearly with the intensity of the incident radiation, two-photon absorption scales quadratically. Higher-order absorptions will scale with yet a higher power of incident intensity. As a result, it is possible to perform multi-photon processes with three dimensional spatial resolution. Further, because these processes involve the simultaneous absorption of two or more photons, the chromophore is excited with a number of photons whose total energy equals the energy of a multi-photon absorption peak, although each photon individually has insufficient energy to excite the chromophore. Because the exciting light is not attenuated by single-photon absorption in this case, it is possible to excite selectively molecules at a greater depth within a material than would be possible via single-photon excitation by use of a beam that is focused to that depth in the material. These two advantages also apply to, for example, excitation within tissue or other biological materials. In multi-photon lithography or stereolithography, the nonlinear scaling of absorption with intensity can lead to the ability to write features below the diffraction limit of light and the ability to write features in three dimensions, which is also of interest for holography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The ability to realize many of the possible applications of two-photon or higher-order absorption by molecules rests on the availability of chromophores with large two-photon or higher-order absorption cross sections. </paragraph>

These compounds exhibit enhanced two-photon or multi-photon absorptivities and allow one to control the position of two-photon or multi-photon absorption bands. The motifs may be generally categorized as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> a) molecules in which two donors are connected to a conjugated &pgr; (pi)-electron bridge (abbreviated &ldquo;D-&pgr;-D&rdquo; motif); </paragraph>

In particular, when two p orbitals are standing perpendicular to the &sgr;-bonded skeleton and overlapping sideways, a &pgr; bond is formed. When there are adjacent p orbitals on each side of an atom, and they overlap with the p orbital on that atom, a situation is created such that a more extended &pgr; orbital is formed in which the electrons in the orbital are no longer confined between two atoms, but rather are delocalized, over a greater number of nuclei. For this to occur, each successive atom bearing a p orbital for overlap must be adjacent to the last. (Sideways overlap of p orbitals is not significant for atoms more than a bond length apart, that is, &tilde;1.5 &angst;.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> This delocalization of &pgr; electrons is of central importance to the chemical and physical properties of unsaturated molecules. In particular, a &pgr;-conjugated bridge is one having a formal structure consisting of double or triple bonds alternating with single bonds where the double and triple bonds are capable of further &pgr; overlap with each other. Such bridges are said to be &pgr;-conjugated and include conjugated double or triple bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Introduction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The invention generally provides compositions of matter that have large two-photon or higher-order absorptivities and in some cases large fluorescence quantum yields, leading to efficient two-photon or higher-order excited fluorescence. By two-photon or higher-order absorption, we refer to the initial simultaneous absorption of two or more photons (also referred to as multi-photon absorption) without the actual population of an excited state by the absorption of a single photon. That is, subsequent to the initial absorption of two or more photons by the molecule, it is possible for the molecule to absorb additional photons from the state populated by the initial absorption event or from a state to which the molecule relaxes. If sufficient total energy is absorbed by the molecule, it is possible to photoionize the molecule, thereby creating a radical cation of the molecule and an unbound electron. Conversion of a molecule to an excited state by two-photon or higher-order absorption according to the invention enables many applications which can be induced from such an excited state, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> For example, we have found that molecules having two or more electron donor groups, such as amino groups or alkoxy groups, connected to aromatic or heteroaromatic end groups as part of a &pgr; (pi)-electron bridge (the combination referred to herein as &ldquo;D-&pgr;-D&rdquo; molecules) exhibit unexpectedly and unusually high two-photon or higher-order absorptivities in comparison to dyes such as stilbene, diphenylpolyenes, phenylene vinylene oligomers and related molecules. In addition, the strength and position of the two-photon or higher-order absorption of these molecules can be tuned and further enhanced by appropriate substitution of the &pgr;-electron bridge with at least one electron accepting group, such as cyano, (referred to herein as &ldquo;D&mdash;A&mdash;D&rdquo; molecules). We have further discovered that molecules having two or more electron acceptor groups such as formyl or dicyanomethylidene groups, connected to aromatic or heteroaromatic end groups as part of a &pgr; (pi)-electron bridge (referred to herein as &ldquo;A-&pgr;-A&rdquo; molecules) exhibit unexpectedly and unusually high two-photon or higher-order absorptivities in comparison to dyes such as stilbene, diphenylpolyenes, phenylene vinylene oligomers and related molecules. The strength and position of the two-photon or higher-order absorption of these molecules can be tuned and further enhanced by appropriate substitution of the &pgr;-electron bridge with electron donating groups, such as methoxy, to form &ldquo;A&mdash;D&mdash;A&rdquo; molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> General Description of Structural Motifs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As a feature of the invention, we have discovered that the aromaticity of the &pgr;-bridge in the electronic ground state is important in determining the energetic position of the electronic state which is responsible for multi-photon absorption relative to the state responsible for one-photon absorption. In particular, having donors attached to aromatic groups or heteroaromatic groups, i.e., D-&pgr;-D and D&mdash;A&mdash;D structures, is conducive to placing the highly absorbing two-photon state energetically above that of the strongly fluorescent one-photon state, which is essential for the molecule to exhibit a high multi-photon fluorescence excitation efficiency. In D&mdash;A&mdash;D molecules, upon absorption of photons, charge is redistributed from the electron donor groups toward the &pgr;-electron bridge, thereby enhancing the molecules&apos; multi-photon absorption characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In addition, having acceptors attached to aromatic groups or heteroaromatic groups, i.e., A-&pgr;-A and A&mdash;D&mdash;A structures, is conducive to placing the highly absorbing two-photon state energetically above that of the strongly fluorescent one-photon state. In A&mdash;D&mdash;A molecules, upon absorption of photons, charge is transferred from the &pgr;-electron bridge toward the electron accepting groups, thereby enhancing the molecules&apos; multi-photon absorption characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the combination of the intrinsically high fluorescence quantum efficiency for these molecules and the rapid relaxation of the two-photon excited molecule from the two-photon state to the lower lying fluorescent one-photon state makes the molecules according to the invention highly efficient multi-photon excitable emitters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As a result of their large multi-photon absorptivities, molecules according to the invention can be used for two-photon or higher-order sensitization by exploiting various photophysical or photochemical mechanisms such as energy transfer or charge transfer. The two-photon or higher-order absorber may directly sensitize various reactions or may transfer energy or charge to another sensitizer which itself sensitizes a further chemical reaction. Applications which would exploit these novel two-photon or higher-order sensitization properties would include photo-deprotection, photocaging or uncaging of biological molecules, photoinitiated polymerization, photochromism, photodissociation, photodimerization, photoisomerizadon, photoinduced electrocyclic rearrangement and photodeposition of various materials including metals, ceramics, ceramic-polymer composites, metal oxides, and metal chalcogenides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In particular, any photochemical reaction which could be carried out by energy transfer or electron transfer could be performed by taking advantage of the associated benefits of two-photon or multi-photon absorption provided that either the S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . .

Turro, <highlight><italic>Modern Molecular Photochemistry, </italic></highlight>Benjamin/Cumming Publishing Company, Menlo Park, 1978, which is incorporated herein by reference) excited states of the molecule were populated by said two-photon or multi-photon absorption or subsequent relaxation and had sufficient energy and/or reducing potential and/or oxidizing potential to foster the desired reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> If the reaction or sensitization process occurs from the triplet state, it is necessary to employ any of a number of well-known mechanisms to foster intersystem crossing from the singlet manifold of states to the triplet manifold of states as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Mechanisms to foster such intersystem crossing processes include, but are not limited to, the inclusion of heavy atoms with large spin-orbit coupling coefficients, the attachment of aromatic ketones to the &pgr;-bridge electronic system of the multi-photon absorbing chromophores and attachment of paramagnetic groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The advantageous combination of strong multi-photon absorption and the ability to sensitize, catalyze, initiate or otherwise render possible chemical reactions, changes of state of materials and emission of light, allow the compounds described here to have a great variety of novel and useful applications including, but not limited to, those described below. </paragraph>

Such sensing relies on the fact that the fluorescence properties of these molecules, including their emission wavelength, efficiency and lifetimes, are all parameters known to be sensitive in a quantifiable manner to external perturbations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> These new two-photon or multi-photon absorbers may be used as fluorophores for imaging of flow fields and diffusional fronts in gels or other porous media, especially in electrophoretic gels. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Another feature of molecules in one embodiment of the invention is that molecules &ldquo;end capped&rdquo; with electron donor substituents, i.e., D-&pgr;-D and D&mdash;A&mdash;D structures, have relatively low oxidation potentials, E<highlight><subscript>&frac12; </subscript></highlight>(in tetrahydrofuran) for the ground-state as exemplified for the series of diamines having increasing length of &pgr;-conjugated bridge in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Upon multi-photon excitation, these molecules become very strong excited state reducing agents and can therefore be used as multi-photon excited electron donors. Such materials can transfer electrons to electron acceptors (which may be covalently attached to the multi-photon absorbing chromophore or could be in a region of space near the multi-photon absorbing chromophore, as would be the case in a concentrated fluid solution or solid solution) to create a radical cation, in the case of a multi-photon absorbing dye and a radical anion, in the case of the acceptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Another feature of some molecules in one embodiment of the invention is that molecules &ldquo;end capped&rdquo; with electron accepting substituents, i.e., A-&pgr;-A and A&mdash;D&mdash;A structures, have relatively high electron affinities in the ground-state form. Furthermore, upon multi-photon excitation, these molecules become very strong excited state oxidizing agents and can therefore be used as multi-photon excited electron acceptors. Such materials can accept electrons from electron donors (which may be covalently attached to the multi-photon absorbing chromophore or could be in a region of space near the multi-photon absorbing chromophore as would be the case in a concentrated fluid or solid solution) to create a radical anion, in the case of a multi-photon absorbing dye, and a radical cation, in the case of the donor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Such radical cations and anions may have different spectroscopic properties from their neutral counterparts and therefore may be used as transient photochromic materials for optical limiting and optical signal processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In addition, these radical ion species generated upon multi-photon absorption can be chemical reactants. For example, these multi-photon absorbing materials can be used to initiate polymerization of monomers which can be polymerized either by radical or ionic mechanisms in the presence or absence of polymerization promoters, including chain transfer agents. Examples of monomers which can be polymerized in these ways include, but are not limited to, vinyl monomers including acrylonitriles, acrylates, diacrylates, triacrylates, polyacrylates, styrenes, trifunctional isocyanurates substituted with acrylates, vinyl- and allyl-containing monomers, divinylbenzene and polymers which are end-capped with or have these groups attached to the carbon backbone such as polyurethanes, polyesters and polyolefins. In addition, examples of polymerizable monomers may be found in G. Odian, <highlight><italic>Principles of Polymerization, </italic></highlight>Second Edition, John Wiley and Son, New York, 1981, page 181, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the invention is that the oxidation potential, reduction potential and the energy difference between the ground state and the fluorescent excited state can be precisely tuned such that the excited state reduction or oxidation potential can also be tuned. In this manner, using the theory for electron transfer developed by Marcus, it is possible to tune both the forward electron transfer rate and charge recombination rate (G. J. Karvaros and N. J. Turro, Chem. Rev. 86, 401-449, 1986). This tunability allows control of, for example, the initiation rate of polymerization or the time constants for generation of absorption changes and recovery in transient photochromic materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the invention is that it is possible to selectively control the position of the multi-photon absorption peak in these molecules by controlling the substituents on the electron donor groups. For example, replacement of the alkyl groups with phenyl groups on the amine of 4,4&prime;-diaminostilbene results in a minimal shift of the linear absorption edge to a longer wavelength, but a shift of the multi-photon absorption maximum 90 nm to longer wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Another feature of this invention is that it is possible to control the position of the multi-photon absorption peak in these molecules by controlling the number of conjugated double bonds between the two donor-substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic end groups for Class 1 compounds (described below), or between the two electron acceptor-substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic end groups for Class 2 compounds (described below). Increasing the number of double bonds leads to a considerable shift of the multi-photon absorption band to longer wavelength. Incorporation of phenylene-vinylene groups between the end groups has a similar effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In most cases, these shifts also result in considerable shifts of the emission maxima to lower energy, which is useful for tuning the multi-photon induced energy transfer properties. This is the case because in the Forster energy transfer mechanism, the energy transfer rate depends upon the degree of overlap of the fluorescence band of the multi-photon absorbing energy donor with the absorption band of the energy-accepting molecule. Control of the location of the multi-photon absorption band and the two-photon excited fluorescence band is also of use in regard to excitation and detection of emission from molecules in an absorbing or scattering medium. For example, absorption and scattering in tissue gives rise to a transmission band at &tilde;700-950 nm, thus molecules can be tailored for optimal two-photon excitation and fluorescence detection efficiency at depth in biological tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Another feature of this invention is that it is possible to tune the lipophilicity, hydrophilicity and overall solubility of the multi-photon absorbing chromophores over a very wide range by the appropriate substitution of the donor groups. For example, 4,4&prime;-bis-dimethylaminostilbene and 4,4&prime;-bis-(diphenyl)aminostilbene are sparingly soluble in nonpolar organic solvents whereas 4,4&prime;-bis(-di-n-butylamino)stilbene and 4,4&prime;-bis(di-4-n-butyl-phenyl)aminostilbene are very soluble, i.e., are lipophilic. In contrast, the hydrochloric acid adduct of the bis-lysyl ester of 4-diethylamino 4&prime;-diethanolaminostilbene and the bis-lysyl ester of 1-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-4-(4&prime;diethanolaminophenyl) buta-1,3diene shown below are hydrophilic. In each case, the molecules maintain their fluorescence in solution.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the invention is that it is possible to substitute the donor groups, and in many cases the acceptor groups, with surface specific functionalities such that the molecules may self assemble on a surface to define a pattern of multi-photon absorbing chromophore. One can then use the various multi-photon induced processes described above to perform chemistry or other optical processes on a patterned substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the invention is that it is possible to substitute the molecule with agents, such as biotin, which allow the molecules to form complexes with reagents (such as antibodies), tissues or surfaces labeled with the protein avidin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the invention is that it is possible to substitute molecules with functional groups such as hydroxyl, cyano and amino, to bind these compounds to metal atoms or to react, for example, with the amine or hydroxyl groups with carboxylic acids, acid chlorides, sugars or aldehydes (in the case of amine functionality). In such a manner, it is possible to greatly increase the diversity of functionality which may be advantageously combined with the multi-photon absorbing properties and the emissive properties of the molecules. For example, attachment of the multi-photon absorbing molecules to amino acids will allow for efficient labeling of proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Since the molecules can be further functionalized as is amply demonstrated herein, molecules according to the invention will have use as labels for a variety of media including tissue, cells, organelles, DNA sequences, proteins, sugar, tumorous tissue, blood components, and as markers for the analysis of combinatorial libraries of chemicals, ligands, and drugs. In particular, since many components in the complex media described above may have strong single-photon absorption, labeling of these media with multi-photon absorbing chromophores or derivatives thereof provides a mechanism to selectively excite the multi-photon absorbing chromophores without interfering absorption by the other (i.e., single-photon absorbing) chromophores which do not have the multi-photon absorption features of chromophores according to the invention. This selective excitation is particularly important for the use of these molecules in biological tissue, for example, where there are many aromatic groups such as heme-containing molecules and indole-containing molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> An advantage which is gained by the efficient multi-photon absorption processes enabled by molecules according to the invention is that it is possible for the absorption to occur in a region of space whose cross sectional area is smaller than that of the diffraction-limited spot size of the exciting beam of light. This is because, for example, a two-photon process is dependent on I<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, where I is the intensity of the exciting beam. The diffraction-limited spot size for a Gaussian beam is given by:

<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In addition, the invention includes molecules that do not fall into Class 1 or Class 2 formulae but are within the scope of the four structural motifs described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> General Description of Uses According to the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the invention are organic molecules having multi-photon absorption. The compositions themselves may exist as crystals, mesoscopic phases, polymers, glasses, liquids or gases. The compositions may be used alone or in combination with other crystals, mesoscopic phases, polymers, glasses liquids or gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The molecules of the present invention may, in some cases, consist of a macroscopic crystal of the molecule. Such crystals may be grown at a slow rate under equilibrium with their mother liquor by a variety of methods known to one skilled in the art. Crystals may also be grown by sublimation at reduced pressure or in some cases from a melt. In the case of vapor or vacuum deposition of crystalline, microcrystalline or amorphorous materials, it is possible using well-developed processes to form multicomponent nanocomposite materials by codeposition with other organic or inorganic materials. Another method of producing a useful optical element involves dissolving the molecule in a solvent to form a solution which can be placed in a container having the desired shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> A particularly convenient and effective form of an optical element in accordance with the invention involves dispersing the multi-photon absorbing molecules in a polymeric or prepolymeric binder. The multi-photon absorbing molecules can be mixed into the binder or grafted onto the polymer, prepolymer or monomer. Suitable binders include polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, polymethacrylate, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(vinyl alcohol), copolymers of methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid, copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride and half ester-acids of the latter, as well as many others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the polymeric binder be highly transparent so that the transparency of the molecules utilized in the practice of this invention can be advantageously employed. However, it is a unique feature of the invention that even in the case where the binder has strong absorption at the wavelength required to initiate single-photon processes, the chromophores may still be excited by the two-photon or multi-photon absorption process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Generally, the methods according to invention are carried out by converting a multi-photon absorbing molecule to an electronically excited state by absorption of at least two photons of radiation. The excited state then facilitates numerous applications. In addition, the molecule may be irradiated with visible, ultraviolet or infrared radiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> One common form an optical element according to the invention can take is that of a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film. As known to those skilled in the art, a small amount of a molecule useful in the practice of this invention, when spread on the surface of a liquid, forms a surface film of monomolecular thickness at the air/liquid interface. When the supporting substrate is slowly immersed in the film bearing liquid body or slowly withdrawn from it, an oriented monomolecular film is formed on the substrate. The preparation and uses of Langmuir-Blodgett films are described in M. C. Petty, M. R. Bryce, D. Bloor, <highlight><italic>Introduction to Molecular Electronics, </italic></highlight>Edward, Arnold, London, 1995, Chapter 10, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Compositions according to the invention are also useful when incorporated into solutions, prepolymers, polymers, Langmuir-Blodgett thin films, and self-assembled monolayers. The compositions can be advantageously modified in such a way as to allow for variation of ease of dissolution in a variety of host media, including liquids and polymeric hosts, by changing the nature of the substituents attached to the central conjugated bridge framework of the molecule as well as by changing either the donors or acceptors. In addition, by controlling the length and composition of the &pgr;-bridge of the molecule, it is possible to control the position and strength of the two-photon (or higher-order) absorption and the two-photon (or higher-order) excited fluorescence. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Some compositions according to the invention may be prepared by reacting appropriate aldehydes with appropriate ylides under standard Wittig conditions. In some cases, the compounds can be synthesized using the McMurray reaction. </paragraph>

Typically, the aldehydes used in the Wittig reaction were commercially available or synthesized by methods previously reported. The phosphonium salts were synthesized according to literature procedures. Other aldehdyes and phosphonium salt that could be employed in this reaction would be known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis and with the aid of the knowledge provided in the example given below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> 0.15 mol of sodium were slowly dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol and added to a solution of 0.05 mol of the corresponding aldehyde and the phosphonium salt in 300 mL of ethanol. This mixture was heated under reflux for 15 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, 100 mL of methanol and 100 mL of water were added to precipitate the substituted trans-stilbene or substituted diphenyl polyene, respectively. Usually, triphenylphosphinoxide and substituted cis-stilbene, also formed in the reaction, don&apos;t precipitate in this solvent mixture. The powder was separated by filtration. Filtration over a short column of Florisil with toluene as eluant usually yields further purification. To achieve correct elemental analysis the products were either chromatographed or recrystallized in ethanol in case of the stilbene derivatives, or acetone in case of the diphenylpolyenes derivatives. The yields varied between 10% and 60% for all of the reactions. </paragraph>

After cooling to ambient temperature, this suspension was poured into water (350 mL). The precipitate was filtered and was then dissolved in hot chloroform. Precipitation of the product was achieved by addition of the chloroform mixture to MeOH. Filtration of the precipitate yielded a purified product that consisted of a 3:1 mixture of 2,5-bis(bromomethyl)-1,4-bis(dodecyloxy)benzene/1,4-bis(dodecyloxy)benzene. This mixture was combined with &gt;2 equivalents of triphenylphosphine and a minimal amount of toluene required to dissolve the triphenylphosphine.

<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> For comparison with the data in Table 2, para-bis(ortho-methylstyryl)benzene, which lacks donor or acceptor substitution, exhibits a two-photon absorptivity of 69&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;50 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>s/photon at 568 nm &lsqb;C. Xu and W. W. Webb, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B, 13, 481 (1996) and S. M. Kennedy and F. E. Lytle, Anal. Chem. 58, 2643 (1986)&rsqb;. In accord with the present invention compounds symmetrically substituted with a pair of terminal donors, &lsqb;i.e., D-&pgr;-D&rsqb; or symmetrically substituted to form molecules according to the donor-acceptor-donor (D&mdash;A&mdash;D) or acceptor-donor-acceptor (A&mdash;D&mdash;A) motifs exhibit substantially enhanced two-photon absorptivities compared to unsubstituted para-bis(ortho-methylstyryl)benzene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> Measurements of two-photon absorptivity by use of the nonlinear optical transmission method in solutions of bis-donor-substituted diphenylpolyenes show a strong dependence on laser pulse duration, as indicated by the values in Table 3. These results provide evidence of nonlinear absorption that is higher-order than two-photon absorption. In particular, the results suggest that these molecules undergo two-photon induced excited-state absorption, that is, two-photon absorption to an excited state and further absorption from this excited state or from a state formed rapidly on relaxation from the initial excited state. A greater excited state population is created with the longer pulses, leading to the enhanced nonlinear absorption coefficient. Additional measurements including transient photoinduced absorption measurements and picosecond time resolved pump and probe measurements confirm the presence of excited-state absorption induced by two-photon absorption, which occurs at the two-photon excitation wavelength. The effective two-photon absorptivities of the series of bis-donor diphenylpolyenes is one to two orders of magnitude larger than that measured with picosecond pulses and, in accord with the present invention, these data demonstrate utility in optical limiting applications involving nanosecond laser pulses. Furthermore, the values of the two-photon absorptivity obtained for the bis donor diphenylpolyenes are an order of magnitude than that of Rhodamine B. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Multi-photon Absorbing Compounds as Polymerization Initiators According to the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> Here we describe the utility of two-photon and multi-photon absorbing molecules as initiators of polymerization, specifically the use of bis-donor-substituted &pgr;-conjugated molecules as two-photon initiators. Such two-photon excitable initiators have utility in two- and three-dimensional lithography applications, for example in three-dimensional optical data storage with ultrahigh storage densities (10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>bits/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>). When applied to a spinning disk (compact disk) type format, two-photon polymerizable materials can offer over a thousand-fold increase in storage capacity. There are two key advantages of two-photon induced polymerization relative to single-photon induced polymerization. Whereas single-photon absorption scales linearly with the intensity of the incident radiation, two-photon absorption scales quadratically. As a result, it is possible to perform two-photon polymerization with three-dimensional spatial resolution. In addition, because the phenomenon involves the simultaneous absorption of two-photons, the chromophore is excited with light of half the energy of the two-photon absorption peak. As a result, it is possible to excite molecules at a greater depth within a material than would be possible via single-photon excitation. These two advantages also apply to for example in vivo photo-initiated polymerization. In lithography or stereolithography, the quadratic scaling of absorption with intensity can lead to the ability to write features below the diffraction limit of light and the ability to write features in three dimensions, which is also of interest for holography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> Bis-donor-substituted &pgr;-conjugated molecules according to this invention exhibit large two-photon absorption cross sections and also possess structural features that permit them to be effective as initiators of polymerization. As has been discussed earlier, these bis-donor-substituted &pgr;-conjugated molecules exhibit large two-photon absorptivities in the visible and the near infrared spectral regions. Another feature of these bisdonor-substituted diphenylpolyene molecules is that the donor groups also impart to them low oxidation potentials. Thus, two-photon or multi-photon excitation of bis-donor-substituted &pgr;-conjugated molecules enables them to function as powerful reducing agents and can reduce even molecules with low electron affinities, including various polymerizable groups such as acrylate monomers. Accordingly, bis-donor-substituted &pgr;-conjugated molecules of this invention are able to function as multi-photon excitable initiators of polymerization. Many amino-substituted phenyl-containing compounds such as aniline, are known to initiate polymerization of vinyl or acrylate monomers upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation through a charge transfer initiation. The charge transfer initiation process may proceed by way of a direct charge transfer that leads to formation of initiating and propagating radical species or by way of a hydrogen abstraction reaction between members of a charge transfer complex involving the aromatic amine and the monomer that also leads to the formation of initiating and propagating radicals. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> The rate of two-photon initiated photopolymerization depends on the two-photon excitation rate and on the quantum yield for initiation.

The rate of initiation for a two-photon excited initiation can be obtained by adapting the standard rate for single-photon initiation and we obtain:</paragraph>

Combining these two equations gives the rate of two-photon excited polymerization as:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> Thus, the rate of polymerization is dependent on the magnitude of the two-photon absorptivity of the initiator and the quantum yield of initiation, which depends both on the characteristics of the initiator and the monomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> 1) Two-Photon Polymerization of Liquid Phase Polyacrylate Monomers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> We have demonstrated that bis-donor-substituted conjugated molecules according to the invention can initiate, following two-photon excitation, the polymerization of crosslinkable liquid polyacrylate monomers. Polymerization of crosslinkable monomers leads to the formation of insoluble polymeric material, such that two-photon initiated polymerization causes the deposition of an easily observable volume of solid polymer on the window of the optical cell. Solutions of alkoxylated trifunctional triacrylate ester (Sartomer 9008) that included polymerization inhibitor MEHQ and containing up to 1% of various bis-donor-substituted conjugated molecules were placed in an optical cell and irradiated with 8-ns pulses with a wavelength of 594 nm from a pulsed dye laser operating at a repetition rate of 20 pulses/s. Irradiations were performed with a collimated beam of cross sectional area of 0.002 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and various pulse energies. The time required for visually observable polymerization was roughly estimated for different irradiations and the results are summarized in Table 5. For cases where the molecules have large two-photon absorptivities at 594 nm, polymerization was observed. Polymerization was generally observed when 13 mJ pulses were used but the intensity was sufficiently high that higher-order nonlinear processes may have led to polymerization. Formation of polymer was demonstrated by the characteristic pattern of infrared bands as determined by IR spectroscopy. The diminution of the peaks assigned to monomer provided further evidence for formation of polymer.

<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> Gel films and thick gel plates of composition II with 66% SR454, 33% PVK and 1% 4-(di-n-butylamino)-4&prime;-(dimethylamino)diphenyl-octa-1,3,5,7-tetraene underwent two-photon initiation of cross-linking by excitation for 5 seconds with 2 mJ, 8 ns, 765 nm laser pulses at 20 pulses/s. A color change was observed in the irradiated spot and upon washing with THF solvent, a small insoluble hemispherical polymer plug was recovered, indicating that cross-linking had occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> 3) Writing of filaments in liquid phase monomers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> The ability to form polymer filaments that taper from an initial diameter ranging from millimeters to tens of microns down to final diameters of one to several microns can be of utility in providing low loss optical guided wave coupling of objects with disparate dimensions. For example, dimensional mismatch is often encountered in attempts to couple optical fibers, which can range between 10 &mgr;m to several hundred &mgr;m in diameter, to semiconductor laser diodes, which can have active areas with a cross sectional dimension of several microns or even less. One feature of the two-photon initiated polymerization disclosed here is that such tapered polymer filaments or arrays of such filaments can be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> Two-photon excitation of a variety of the disclosed diphenylpolyene derivatives in the presence of acrylate monomers leads to the formation of polymer. For example, with the two-photon absorbing molecule dissolved at 1% concentration in triacrylate monomer, excitation leads to formation of a visually observable cross-linked polymer spot on the wall of the vessel. It was observed that when irradiating a liquid cross-linkable triacrylate monomer containing a two-photon absorbing molecule (for example Sartomer 9008 with 1% 4,4&prime;-bis(dibutylamino)stilbene) using a laser beam at a wavelength of 600 nm, an intensity of &tilde;100 MW/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and a diameter of about 1 mm that the cross-linked polymer volume that formed was tapered to a point as the polymer advanced from the window into the bulk of the liquid. This tapering suggested that the two-photon polymerization of the monomer led to a focusing of the beam into the monomer as the polymerization proceeded. We have also observed that prolonged exposure of a particular spot at the window/monomer solution interface leads to the development of a fine filament of polymer that extends for several millimeters into the solution. This process is the two-photon analog of the photopolymerization induced optical self-focusing and trapping reported recently (A. S. Kewitsch and A. Yariv, <highlight><italic>Optics Lett., </italic></highlight>21(1), 24 (1996).) This demonstration was performed using Sartomer 9008 with 1% 4,4&prime;-bis(dibutylamino)stilbene and 8 ns, 532 nm laser pulses at a pulse rate of 10 pulses/s. Using a beam that was focused onto the window with lenses varying from f/4 to f/7 and pulse energies of 0.3 to 0.4 mJ, filaments 1 to 4 mm in length could be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> 4) Three Dimensional Optical Memory by Writing Cross Linked Voxels in Photopolymer Systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> Webb, et al. (e.g., J. H. Strickler and W. Webb, <highlight><italic>Optics Lett., </italic></highlight>26, 1780-1782, (1991)) described two-photon initiated polymerization as a means for optical data recording utilizing a commercial photoresist prepared in a 170 &mgr;m thick film format where highly localized volumes in such a film were exposed with ultrashort laser pulses from a mode-locked titanium sapphire laser system. The exposed volumes exhibited a change in refractive index upon polymerization which served as a means of optical data storage. Retrieval of information was accomplished with differential contrast interference microscopy. Two-photon polymerized refractive index voxels of 0.3 &mgr;m diameter were written and sheets of voxel patterns spaced about 3 &mgr;m were created, with a sheet spacing limit of about 1 &mgr;m, leading to storage densities of &tilde;10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>bits/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> The multi-photon absorbing materials of the invention and photopolymer compositions based on them can be used to form recording media for two or three dimensional optical data storage. The advantages of using two-photon induced processes for three dimensional optical data storage are well known. Using a strongly focused optical beam it is possible to produce localized two-photon excitation in a volume of the order of 1 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, thus resulting in data storage densities of 10<highlight><superscript>12 </superscript></highlight>bits/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Additionally, using crossed optical beams, spots or sheets of data can be stored or addressed in three dimensions, albeit at lower data densities. The disclosed compositions have utility in forming three dimensional optical data storage media with high recording sensitivity, due to the large two-photon absorptivities exhibited by these materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> Experiments to record small volume spots of cross-linked polymer were performed using a picosecond pulsed dye laser as the excitation source. This system provided 4 ps pulses at a repetition rate of 3.7 MHz with an average power of 30 to 40 mW in the 600 to 650 nm range. The laser beam was expanded to fill a microscope objective (numerical aperture&equals;0.25) so as to produce a 1.4 &mgr;m spot size at the focus. Exposures with different powers and durations were conducted. The two two-photon photopolymer compositions (I and II) described above were used as the recording media. Written spots were observed by optical microscopy and by washing the films with a solvent to strip away uncross-linked polymer and leave behind on the substrate spots of crosslinked material. The quality of the laser beam spatial profile, the exposure time, the power, the focusing and the material composition were found to be crucial in the ability to write spots and for the spot size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> It was demonstrated that 3 &mgr;m diameter spots could be written at different depths in &tilde;200 &mgr;m thick films of composition II with 66% SR454, 33% PVK and 1% 4-(di-n-butylamino)-4&prime;-(dimethylamino)diphenyl-octa-1,3,5,7-tetraene, using 600 or 650 nm picosecond pulses focused with the numerical aperture&equals;0.25 microscope objective. With higher power objectives, smaller spots can be written. By writing spots of this material on the substrate/photopolymer interface, it was shown that these spots were left behind as insoluble polymer spots after washing with a solvent overnight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> Using spin coated thin films of composition I with varying percentages of 4,4&prime;-bis(dibutylamino)stilbene, tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate triacrylate, (Sartomer SR368) and poly(methylmethacrylate), it was shown that the power required to write the crosslinked polymer depended on the concentration of the two-photon absorber. Good optical quality films 200 &mgr;m thick were made with a composition of 1% 4,4&prime;-bis(dibutylamino)stilbene, 40% Sartomer SR368 and the remainder PMMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> Fluorescence of the multi-photon absorbing molecules of the present invention can be enhanced upon polymerization of the local monomer concentration relative to that of the absorber in the presence of unpolymerized monomer. Because of the charge-transfer interaction or other interactions between the two-photon excited molecule and the monomer, the fluorescence of the excited molecule is highly quenched. Upon polymerization of the monomer, the quenching ability of the monomer is eliminated and the excited-absorbers are able to emit with an unquenched efficiency. Thus, the two-photon initiated polymerization can lead to a &ldquo;turning on&rdquo; of the fluorescence efficiency of the polymerized spot. This feature can provide an advantage for the readout of stored bits of information because the two-photon excited fluorescence can be used to readout as opposed to other more complex, expensive and cumbersome methods such as differential interference microscopy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> Multi-photon absorbing molecules of the invention, the compositions described above and related compositions based on other monomers or crosslinkable monomers, other polymer binders and other additives such as chain transfer agents, can be employed as multi-photon absorbing recording media for holographic recording. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> B. Single-Photon Excited Polymerization Using Bis-donor-substituted &pgr;-Conjugated Molecules According to the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> Molecules according to the present invention that behave as two-photon initiators for polymerization of acrylates can also initiate polymerization when irradiated with wavelengths of light for which the molecules exhibit strong linear absorption. Thus these molecules represent a new class of near UV and visible initiators. Furthermore, from the parallel chemistry observed by single and two photon absorption, one can reasonably conclude that photon absorbing molecules that are single-photon initiators will also act as two-photon initiators, providing that the two-photon state is higher in energy than the one-photon state. This can be ascertained with some degree of certainty by observing whether the molecule is fluorescent. It is well known to those knowledgeable of the spectroscopy of &pgr;-conjugated molecules that when the two-photon state is substantially lower in energy than the one-photon state, the molecules are not fluorescent, whereas when the two-photon state is higher than the one-photon state, the molecules can be fluorescent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> Thus, thin films of poly(triacrylate) can be prepared by excitation with low power 360 nm radiation of molecules that behave as two-photon initiators. The films so prepared were identified as poly(triacrylates) by IR spectroscopy. The polymerization did not take place in the presence of benzoquinone, which is a typical inhibitor for radical polymerizations. During the polymerization, the solutions turned green and the UV spectrum has an absorption peak at 650 nm indicative of the stilbene radical-cation which was independently characterized by spectro -electrochemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> Methylacrylate was polymerized in bulk under the absence of air by irradiation with a 450 W medium pressure mercury lamp. The molecular weight of the polymer was above 400 000. The estimated molecular weight from comparison of the elution time to the polystyrene standard was Mw&equals;697 000, Mn&equals;429 000. Furthermore, the polymer, characterized by IR spectroscopy showed a spectrum identical with that in the literature. After washing the polymer several times with CHCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the polymer exhibited fluorescence in the blue (&tilde;420 nm), indicating incorporated or bound initiator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> The bis-dibutylaminostilbene also polymerizes methylmethacrylate, yielding a soluble polymer in chloroform or CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Once again, the molecular weight is higher than 400 000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> Methylmethacrylate polymerizations were carried out in ethanol and toluene. Thus, 0.5 mL of the monomer were dissolved in 0.5 mL of the corresponding solvent in an ampoule. After adding 10 mg of bis-dibutylaminostilbene to each ampoule, nitrogen was bubbled through for 54 minutes and the ampoules were sealed. The samples were irradiated for 6 h with a 450 W medium pressure mercury lamp. In the ethanol-containing ampoule, poly(methylmethacrylate) was formed. In the toluene-containing ampoule, no polymerization was observed. It was further shown that the polymerization occurred in acetonitrile and acetone but not in benzene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> A critical issue related to in situ photopolymerization addressed in this invention is limitations that may be introduced by the use of visible light; specifically, visible light does not penetrate tissues or other absorbing or scattering media at depth. To address this deficiency, we have developed photoinitiators which can be activated by two-photon absorption of near-infrared light, which has the greatest penetration depth through tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> Conventional photoinitiators for use in biomedical or materials processing, such as xanthine-based dyes, are activated by single-photon excitation of their absorption bands in the visible spectrum. These visible photoinitiators have been used for stereolithography and for in situ polymerization, but their utility for in vivo photopolymerization is limited in some applications (e.g., when fiber optics are impractical) by the small penetration depth in tissues at visible wavelengths. Photoinitiators that can be activated by two-photon absorption of near-IR photons can provide tremendous advantages over conventional photoinitiators. For photopolymerization through tissue, increased optical energy delivery and localization through tissue will result in shorter illumination times and better ability to localize the photopolymerization. Moreover, a new generation of inexpensive and highly reliable femtosecond Ti:sapphire lasers are being commercialized, making such treatment more accessible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> A complementary approach is based on the use of Forster energy transfer to create a bichromophoric photoinitiators wherein the two-photon absorber is covalently attached to a xanthine-based photoinitiator (e.g., rose bengal) such that energy transfer from the two-photon absorber to the xanthine photoinitiator initiates polymerization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> C. Photodeprotection and Photodecaging </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> A method for multi-photon deprotection or photodecaging of groups is described in which a multi-photon absorbing dye is attached to known photodeprotecting groups or photodecaging groups. In this method a dye can absorb two-photons or more of energy, and through an energy or charge transfer mechanism, serve to excite the attached photodeprotecting or photodecaging group, thereby inducing the deprotection of a functional group which could be a drug, neurotransmitter, metal ion or other chemical reagent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> Two specific examples of photodeprotecting schemes involving attachment of known deprotecting groups to two-photon absorbing dyes are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> Multi-photon Absorbing Compounds According to the Invention as Optical Limiting Materials </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> A. Introduction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> Two-photon and higher-order absorbing compositions in accordance with the invention are useful in optical power or energy limiting devices. These devices can be used to protect eyes or sensors from intense optical pulses, to modify the shape of the optical output pulse from lasers, to perform a thresholding function on optical pulses for signal processing, or for optically controlled spatial light modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> Materials that exhibit nonlinear absorption can be used for optical limiting devices. Such materials, including excited-state absorbers, two-photon absorbers or higher-order absorbers are initially highly transparent over a certain spectral band and become more strongly absorbing in this band as the incident optical intensity or energy is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> One of the significant applications of optical limiting devices is in laser eye or sensor protection. The exposure of human eyes or sensors to intense optical pulses can lead to permanent damage or to impaired visual performance and thus presents a serious problem to those working in environments where lasers may be encountered. Frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:yttrium/aluminum/garnet lasers are very common and for these lasers (which have pulse durations of 10 ns and a wavelength of 532 nm), the ED<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>level (the exposure energy for which there is a 50% probability of producing a retinal lesion) is about 3 &mgr;J, whereas the ANSI standard maximum permissible exposure level is about 0.1 &mgr;J. In the laboratory or field environments, laser pulse energies of 1 to 100 &mgr;J may be present, sometimes in the form of an unanticipated surface reflection off an optical component. Thus, protection devices must provide nonlinear attenuation and a high linear optical transmittance, to allow high visibility under ambient working conditions. Although fixed wavelength or broadband absorptive filters can be used to block laser beams from eyes or sensors, as in current commercial goggles for laser eye protection, these types of filters often impair visibility or color vision and are ineffective when there are multiple wavelengths or tunable lasers present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of materials and mechanisms have been investigated for use in optical limiting, however most existing materials have significant drawbacks such as a limited range of linear transmission or insufficient blocking ability. Optical limiting by two-photon absorption in semiconductors is well known and involves both two-photon absorption and nonlinear refraction due to the two-photon excited free carriers. However, most semiconductor materials are of limited utility for high dynamic range optical limiting because of their relatively low optical damage thresholds. Organic molecules can also exhibit two-photon absorption, but generally the two-photon absorptivities of molecules examined to date, which are actually small in number and of limited range in structure, fall short of the levels needed for optical limiting by two or more orders of magnitude. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> As a result, with the present invention one can provide optical limiting devices using molecular two-photon or higher-order absorbers with large peak two-photon or higher-order absorptivities, as exemplified by effective two-photon absorptivities of &gt;1,000&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;50 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>s photon<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and high linear transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> In addition, molecules according to the present invention can provide a broad bandwidth optical limiting material based on a mixture of molecular two-photon or higher-order absorbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> Moreover, these molecules can provide optical limiting devices using a two-photon or higher-order absorbing material based on a mixture of molecular two-photon absorbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> Two-photon or higher-order absorbers, of the type described in this disclosure, which have large two-photon or effective two-photon absorptivities are attractive materials for optical limiting since they can achieve large nonlinear attenuation and maintain very high linear transmittance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> B. Optical Limiting Materials in Accordance with the Present Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes a class of molecules which exhibit very strong two-photon absorption in a spectral region where the linear transmission is very high. The present invention provides compositions of matter which have exceptionally large two-photon absorptivities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> In particular, we teach that bis-amino substitution of diphenylpolyenes and related conjugated structures leads to strong two-photon bands with excitation wavelengths in the transparent region of the molecules, below the one photon absorption edge. Also, di-aryl substitution of the amines leads to a significant red shift of the two-photon absorption band but a smaller shift of the lowest one-photon absorption band. This provides utility in formulating broadband limiting materials which preserve transparency. Furthermore, by combining two-photon absorber molecules which have two-photon absorption bands at different positions but which are each transparent over a targeted region of the spectrum, broadband optical limiting materials with high transparency can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> Large optical limiting effects have been observed with the new two-photon absorbers with large peak effective two-photon absorptivities (e.g., &gt;1000&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;50 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>s-photon<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. These effects have been observed using only moderate intensity nanosecond pulses. In earlier materials, large optical limiting effects are observed only for very high intensity picosecond pulses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> The optical limiting by two-photon absorption in 4-dimethylamino-4&prime;-dibutylaminostilbene (MBDAS) for 605-nm, 8-ns laser pulses in a collimated beam geometry is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. At low incident energy, the transmission is close to 1.0, i.e., the sample is nonabsorbing. For input energies above &tilde;100 &mgr;J (fluences above &tilde;0.1 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), the transmission decreases and at an input energy of &tilde;2000 &mgr;J (fluence of 2 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), the transmission drops to 0.15. The collimated beam geometry utilized for this measurement was one used mainly for characterizing the nonlinear transmission and not to optimize the optical limiting response. A line corresponding to a transmission of 1.0 is shown for reference. The sample was a 0.33M MBDAS solution in acetone with a pathlength of 1 cm. The measurements were made with 605 nm, 8-ns laser pulses in a collimated beam geometry with a beam diameter of &tilde;400 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> For such nonlinear transmission experiments, the spatial beam profile of the dye laser was adjusted to produce a roughly flat intensity distribution across a roughly 5-mm diameter beam. The beam was passed through an 8.5&times;beam reducing telescope. The position of the second lens in the telescope system was adjusted to produce a collimated beam over the length of the 1-cm sample cell holder. The sample solutions were placed in 1 cm pathlength quartz cells; the cell holder was about 50 mm from the second lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> Typical maximum input energies into the samples were about 2.5 mJ. The energy delivered to the samples was controlled by a series of calibrated neutral density (ND) filters. A 4% beam splitter was inserted after the ND filter holder and this reference beam was sent to a 15 mm diameter silicon photodetector (equipped with appropriate ND filters to assure that the signal did not saturate the detector). A similar detector system was placed 75 mm after the optical limiting samples to collect the transmitted laser signal and to measure the total transmitted energy. This large area was chosen for performing total transmitted energy measurements, since nonlinear refractive effects caused defocusing effects in the transmitted beam. The detector outputs were integrated using a boxcar integrator and the integrator output was digitized and read by a PC computer. Measurements of the sample transmissions were repeated for a range of input laser energies (via the neutral density filters). The data were then analyzed by fitting them to the solution of the intensity propagation equation for two-photon absorption and optical limiting. For samples with no linear absorption, plots of 1/T versus intensity were fit to the equation:

<paragraph id="P-0417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0417&rsqb;</number> The two-photon absorptivity of MBDAS was 13,500&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;50 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>s/photon. For comparison, a value of 850&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;50 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>s was recently reported &lsqb;G. S. He, G. C. Xu, P. N. Prasad, B. A. Reinhardt, J. C. Bhatt, and A. G. Dillard, Optics Letters, 20 435 (1995)&rsqb;. For a bis(benzthiazole)dialkoxythiophene compound in solution and was reported to be two orders of magnitude higher than a reference dye (Rhodamine 6G). Clearly, the effective two-photon absorptivity for MBDAS is very large. Much stronger optical limiting response is expected for MBDAS solutions in focusing optical systems. However, even in this unoptimized geometry, the response for the MBDAS solution is better than that of the best phthalocyanine excited-state absorber (chloroindium tetra-(tert-butyl)phthalocyanine) solution with a transmission of 0.95). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> The new multi-photon absorbers according to the present invention afford several interesting advantages for optical limiting. Firstly, these molecules exhibit effective two-photon absorptivities that are about one or more orders of magnitude higher for current state of the art materials. With such high two-photon absorptivities, these molecules are effective in limiting nanosecond duration pulses Secondly, these molecules can have very high broadband linear transmission, since the two-photon absorption bands occur for photon energies well below the linear absorption edge. This could be a huge advantage, since low linear transmission and impairment of normal color vision are major concerns for potential users of laser protective devices. Secondly, broadband two-photon absorbing molecules have been prepared from mixtures of compounds, all of which are essentially transparent over much of the visible spectrum, each with different two-photon resonances that span a wide band. Finally, these two-photon absorbing molecules perform very well at high intensities such that good short pulse performance is assured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> We have demonstrated optical limiting based on the new molecular two-photon and multi-photon absorbers described herein in different optical geometries and with combinations of materials as described below. The optical limiting compositions according to the present invention may exist as crystals, mesoscopic phases, polymers, glasses, liquids or gases. The compositions may be used alone or in combination with other crystals, mesoscopic phases, polymers, glasses, liquids or gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0420" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0420&rsqb;</number> Depending upon the particular application the multi-photon absorber may be incorporated, in the form of a concentration gradient profile, into a material, to form a concentration gradient optical limiting material. Such gradients have been demonstrated for excited state absorption-type optical limiting materials. Concentration gradient materials can be made by solvent-assisted in-diffusion of molecules into porous solids or gels, by sequential deposition of layered thin film materials wherein the concentration of the dye in each layer is varied appropriately. This may be accomplished by forming a laminate structure comprised of thin films of free standing polymer containing the multi-photon absorber. Alternatively, gradient materials can be produced by codeposition of the dye with an inert binder material, with the relative rates of deposition of each material being varied with time to as to form a concentration gradient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> We have performed optical limiting experiments using our multi-photon absorbers in a focusing optical system. In one example, solutions of 4,4&prime;-bis(dibutylamino)stilbene (BDAS) in acetone were placed in a 1 cm pathlength cell positioned into the focus of an f/5 focusing lens. The transmitted optical energy was collected with a matched f/5 lens and relayed onto a silicon photodiode detector. Optical limiting responses for solutions with two different concentrations (0.01 and 0.134 moles/liter) of the BDAS were obtained and are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. At the concentration of 0.134 moles/liter, the sample linear transmission at 605 nm was 96%. The transmission of the sample at an input energy of 170 &mgr;J dropped to about 0.10. Although the sample pathlength was 1 cm, the effective interaction length was much smaller, &lt;100 &mgr;m, due to the fact that the intensity falls off as z<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>from the focus and the rate of attenuation due to two-photon absorption depends on the square of the intensity. Thus, the rate of attenuation due to two-photon absorption falls off from the focus as z<highlight><superscript>&minus;4</superscript></highlight>. As a result, at one confocal length from the focus, the attenuation rate is reduced by a factor of 4 relative to that at the focus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> illustrates two-photon optical limiting responses of 0.01 and 0.134 M solutions of 4,4&prime;-bis(dibutylamino)stilbene for &tilde;5-ns, 600 nm pulses. The straight line corresponds to the linear transmission (96%) of the 0.134 M solution. A 1 cm cell was centered on the focus of an &tilde;f/5 optical system (effective interaction length &lt;100 &mgr;m) and the total transmitted energy was detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> Solutions or materials containing the multi-photon absorbing molecules according to the invention such as 4,4&prime;-bis(dibutylamino)stilbene, exhibit strong nonlinear optical beam spreading such that the transmitted energy emanating from the absorber is defocused and spread over a larger area for strong inputs compared to weaker ones. As a result, greater protection from optical damage is obtained for a detector or sensor placed at the final focal plane of the system. Yet further enhancements in the protection afforded by these multi-photon absorbers can be obtained by placement of a suitable aperture stop at an intermediary focal plane, so as to entirely eliminate the transmitted energy that falls outside the pupil of the stop, as a result of nonlinear beam spreading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0424" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0424&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> shows the nonlinear absorption peaks for 4,4&prime;-bis-(di-n-butylamino)stilbene and 4,4&prime;-bis-(diphenylamino)stilbene and the linear transmission of a mixture of these compounds at a total concentration of 0.1 M. The absorption edge for 4,4&prime;-bis-(di-n-butylamino)stilbene has an onset at 500 nm, so that the material is transparent from 500 nm to longer wavelengths throughout the visible spectral range. Thus, the two-photon absorption band occurs in a region of high transparency. The two-photon peak at 600 nm is fairly sharp, but we have shown that simple diphenyl substitution on the amines gives rise to a broader two-photon peak that is shifted to &tilde;690 nm, even though the one photon peak is red shifted by only 20 nm. A mixture of these materials would cover well the range from 560 to 730 nm, as demonstrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Experiments show that such a mixture of 4,4&prime;-bis(dibutylamino)stilbene and 4,4&prime;-bis(diphenylamino)stilbene shows a net two-photon absorptivity that is equal to the sum of the two-photon absorptivities of the two individual molecules. For example, measurements at 650 nm, corresponding to the wavelength where the two-photon spectra of the two molecules cross, show that the net two-photon absorptivity is additive in the contribution from each compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> illustrates linear transmission spectrum (solid line) of a mixture of 4,4&prime;-bis(dibutylamino)stilbene and 4,4&prime;-bis(diphenylamino)stilbene for a total concentration of 0.1M. Also shown are the wavelength dependent two-photon absorptivities for each compound: triangles are for the dibutyl derivative and squares are for the diphenyl derivative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> Thus, we teach that a combination of chromophores with alkyl and aryl substituents on the amino groups of diaminostilbenes produces materials with broadband two-photon absorption and high transparency. Additional shorter wavelength two-photon absorbers could be added with no compromise of the linear transmission in order to further extend the two-photon absorption to cover the whole visible spectrum. For example, a 4,4&prime;-bis(diphenylamino) biphenyl or a 4,4&prime;-bis(diphenylamino) fluorene would add a two-photon absorption band at approximately 500 to 550 nm, but would not reduce the linear transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0427" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0427&rsqb;</number> A mechanism to enhance the two-photon absorptivity at a given wavelength is to synthesize molecules with extended conjugation such that the single-photon absorption edge approaches the fundamental frequency of the laser, without leading to substantially increased linear loss. For example, simply extending the number of bridging double bonds in the stilbene derivatives from one to five double bonds enhances the effective two-photon absorptivity by a factor of five. The enhanced two-photon absorption is evidenced in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> where the nonlinear transmission of 4,4&prime;-bis-(di-n-butylamino)stilbene is compared with 1-(di-4-n-butylaminophenyl)-10-(4-dimethylaminophenyl) deca 1,3,5,7,9-pentaene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0428" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0428&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> illustrates nonlinear transmission data showing enhanced two-photon absorption in a 1-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-10-(4-dibutylaminophenyl)-deca-1,3,5,7,9-pentane (squares) as compared to the 4,4&prime;-bis-(di-n-butylamino)stilbene (circles). Measurements were performed at 598 nm using 0.01M solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0429" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0429&rsqb;</number> Another feature of this invention is the ability to systematically control the position of the lowest two-photon absorption band of bis donor-substituted &pgr;-conjugated molecules by increasing the &pgr;-conjugation length of the molecule by, for example, controlling the number of conjugated double bonds between the two donor-substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic end groups. Thus, increasing the number of double bonds, leads to a considerable shift of the two-photon absorption band to longer wavelengths. Incorporation of phenylene-vinylene groups between the end groups has a similar effect. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to hermetic packages and, more particularly, relates to an electroplated, hermetically-sealed, electrical package. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, there has been a growing trend to develop miniature hermetic packages for protection of micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) and integrated circuitry from harsh external environments. In implantable biomedical applications, it is important to develop biocompatible packages that insulate the MEMS and integrated circuitry within the system from the biological environment. Without any reliable protection method, top layer thin-film dielectrics, such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, or polymers, will break down in biological environments. Furthermore, these biocompatible packages must meet strict size limitations enforced by the demands of the biological environment. As a result, the package must not only be hermetic, it must also have a small size and be low profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the past, long-term hermetic biopackaging has been demonstrated extensively by anodic bonding of glass to polysilicon, by encapsulation with silicone rubber, and by encapsulation with Parylene-C. However, techniques that utilize wafer bonding are hampered by the need for planarization techniques to improve bond quality. Furthermore, these methods are also limited by the material and temperature requirements of implantable electronics. Implantable systems also require biocompatible packaging materials, which limit the use of many lead-based glasses and solders traditionally used in wafer bonding. The low thermal budget of processed electronics prevents other bonding techniques, such as fusion bonding, from being a useful packaging approach. Other methods of biopackaging have relied upon organic films for protection. However, these organic films often break down during accelerated tests and may not be optimized as a hermetic barriers to moisture. As a result, it is difficult to predict package lifetimes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Recently, implantable devices have been manufactured in silicon substrates. These devices require packages integrated at the wafer level in order for them to have both a functional viability and an economic viability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there exists a need in the relevant art to provide a method of hermetically sealing a package that doesn&apos;t readily break down in biological environments. Furthermore, there exists a need in the relevant art to provide a method of hermetically sealing a package that effectively prevents infiltration of moisture. Still further, there exists a need in the relevant art to provide a hermetic package that overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to the principles of the present invention, a novel technology is provided for encapsulating electronics for use in harsh media applications, such as human body implants. The present invention is a method that includes electroplating a thick metal film on top of an insulating layer to fully encapsulate and hermetically seal a system. More particularly, a dielectric layer, such as polyimide, glass, SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or polymer, is deposited on top of an integrated circuit which is integrated onto a wafer. The polyimide layer (or other insulating dielectric layer) is then photolithographically patterned and removed from the field region and left over the integrated circuit or device region that is to be protected. A metal film is then sputter deposited on top of the dielectric layer (or the wafer). A photo-resist mold is then deposited on the wafer and developed using standard lithography. This wafer is then placed into an electroplating station. In areas on the wafer covered with photo-resist, no plating will occur. In the exposed areas, a relatively thick electroplated film will form (the thickness of this film can be varied according to specific application areas). The photo-resist mold is then stripped in a wet chemical bath, or in a dry etching apparatus, and the image of the mold is reversed to cover the plated film. The sputtered layer is then removed in wet or dry chemicals to remove or at least neutralize the chemical etchants that typically attack a sputtered layer, which may reduce the hermeticity of the plated film. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Generally, the present invention relates to planar, photolithographically-defined micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) for implantable biomedical applications. To this end, the present invention defines a new method of packaging implantable electronics employing a thin film of polyimide, or other insulator, encased in electroplated gold. The insulator insulates the electronics in the circuit from the gold layer. The method of the present invention differs from previous work in that it employs and/or produces hermetic packages at the wafer level and does not require bonding, high temperatures, or large electric fields that may potentially damage electronic circuitry. An additional advantage of the present invention is that the thickness of the entire implantable system can be reduced to less than 50 microns, which dramatically improves its usability in biomedical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As mentioned, the present invention is particularly useful in the encapsulation of integrated circuits for implantable devices. However, it should D be readily understood that the principles of the present invention may find utility in a wide variety of applications. Therefore, although the following describes the preferred embodiment, its disclosure should not be construed to limit the scope of protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an ultra-thin hermetic biocompatible package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated according to the principles of the present invention as applied to implantable silicon microprobes with on-chip circuitry. Hermetic biocompatible package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally includes a silicon microprobe substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a micro device or circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a plurality of electrical connects <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a dielectric layer or insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and an electroplated gold shield or outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to create chronically implantable devices with active electronic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, electrical connects <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are preferably formed by running insulated polysilicon lines underneath electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Since electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is deposited on and conforms to electrical connects <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, there is no need for any special planarization steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> insulates the electronics in circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Selection of the material for dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is critical to the effectiveness of hermetic biocompatible package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be made from a number of materials, such as any insulating in-organic film, polyimide, glass, SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or polymer. However, the thickness and dielectric constant of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will determine the parasitic capacitance of circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which may limit the frequency response of circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably, dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> should demonstrate good adhesion to metal and cure at a temperature that is lower than the thermal budget of the remaining process steps to prevent bubbling of dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the present embodiment, it is preferable that dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is polyimide because of its low dielectric constant and its ease of being spun cast into a thick film that cures above 350&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used to encapsulate at least a portion of silicon microprobe substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, circuit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, electrical connects <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to provide a thick hermetic barrier to penetrating moisture. Metals are preferably chosen due to their high density and, thus, excellent performance as hermetic barriers. With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it can be seen that metal films are substantially more resistant to moisture penetration than films of other materials of comparable thickness. Selection of the proper metal film for electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> depends upon several factors. For instance, it has been found that silicon will etch when exposed to a Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) solution, which is used to simulate body conditions at elevated temperature in laboratory settings. This 7.4 pH solution exhibits etch characteristics that are similar to Ethylene Diamine Pyrocatechol (EDP), Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), and Potassium Hydroxide (KOH), albeit at a much slower rate. In extended implants of thin silicon devices, this etch rate cannot be ignored as it creates a mechanisms for failure through dissolution of the silicon beneath the active electronics. Since both the silicon of the implantable device and the metal shield form the structure of the package, the long-term reliability of both materials must be considered in package design. Accordingly, it is preferable that outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is gold due to its ease of electroplating, high density, and biocompatibility properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, to mitigate the dissolution of silicon, two corrosion reduction techniques have been developed. One approach involves a degenerately boron-doped etch stop while the other utilizes an in-situ self-induced galvanic bias of the silicon. Given that it is impractical to implement a degenerately boron-doped layer beneath the active electronics of an implantable system, the self-induced galvanic bias technique should be used to reduce the corrosion of silicon in long-term implants. We have found that an Au&mdash;Si battery potential reduces the dissolution of silicon by three orders of magnitude in PBS, which again makes gold a preferred choice for encapsulating dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in hermetic biocompatible package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the mechanism by which a galvanic bias is implemented on substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using a PBS solution and applying a voltage to effect such electroplating. Gold is thus selected as the metal layer to encapsulate dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for its galvanic properties as well as its ease of electroplating, high density, inertness, and biocompatibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For any packaging technology, some of the most important factors are reliability and manufacturability. That is, in order for a technology to demonstrate its practicality, it must be capable of being reproducibly made and have a lifetime greater than the device it encapsulates. This is particularly important in one of the potential applications of the present invention-encapsulation of neural prostheses for chronic implants. These devices have been proposed for the treatment of nervous system impairment and may need to be implanted for the entire lifetime of a young patient. As a result, the package will need to maintain hermeticity for greater than 50 years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in order to demonstrate the initial effectiveness of hermetic biocompatible package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an implantable probe substrate with a 3 mm&times;5 mm back end, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, was fabricated to serve as a test structure. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the process flow for producing the test structure is illustrated. In the preferred device, active circuitry <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> would be placed in a lightly-doped region on the back end of the probe as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the implantable probe substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is first defined using deep boron diffusion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a 2-micron thick layer of P12611 polyimide 24 is then spin casted to form dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Next, a 500 &angst; Cr/5000 &angst; Au plating base is sputtered. Subsequently, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a 3-micron thick gold film is electroplated from a cyanide-based solution through a photoresist mold to cover dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and form electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A negative photoresist is then used to invert the image of the plating mold to protect the gold during the removal of the plating base. The sputtered Cr/Au plating base is then removed in a wet etch. If electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not protected during the removal of the sputtered Cr/Au plating base, the hermeticity of electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be adversely impacted. At this point in the process, the probes are fully packaged at the wafer level. The final step, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), is to perform a dissolved wafer release with EDP at 110&deg; C., an anisotropic silicon etchant that exhibits an excellent etch stop on boron-doped silicon and gold. When viewed in cross section, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates dielectric polyimide layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> being encapsulated by electroplated gold outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Initial designs of hermetic biocompatible package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also used AZ4400 photoresist and Shipley 1827 as dielectric spacers. However it was discovered that photoresist tends to readily outgas when exposed to temperatures around 110&deg; C. even when hard baked for extended periods. The material outgassing from the photoresist will exert a pressure on the gold film sufficient to rupture it, causing hermetic failure. As a result, attempts to utilize photoresist for insulating spacers were abandoned, as it cannot meet the necessary reliability requirements of this project. It is possible to use materials other than polyimide for hermetic biocompatible package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thick layers of evaporated glass would meet all of the necessary requirements of this process. Other dielectrics, such as Parylene and BCB would also be suitable, provided they demonstrate good adhesion to chromium. These materials may in fact be preferable to polyimide in that they could potentially trap less moisture than polyimide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> To test the chronic hermeticity of hermetic biocompatible package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a test structure was developed as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>. The fabrication process for this structure is set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Specifically, as seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a bare silicon wafer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is first degenerately doped with phosphorous and then a 5000 &angst; thick layer of thermal SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is grown and patterned thereon. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a 5000 &angst; layer of aluminum is then sputtered deposited and patterned such that it forms an integrated leak detector circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This integrated leak detector circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> consists of twelve series-connected aluminum sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that are approximately 4.7 mm long by 100 &mgr;m wide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Leak detector circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> operates through a reliable mechanism. That is, when soaked in a corrosive solution, aluminum sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will quickly etch, altering the resistance of circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. These resistors are connected in series to make the test a binary measurement of package hermeticity. One end of the resistor contacts the conductive substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> beneath thermal SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> while the other end of the resistor contacts electroplated outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through dielectric layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at via <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>)). A parallel connection of the strips can indicate the degree to which moisture has penetrated the package, but for this application, any penetration is unacceptable. Once fabricated, the resistor is packaged in a layer of 5-micron thick P12731 photodefinable polyimide <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is encapsulated with 3-micron thick electroplated gold outer layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The thicker, photodefinable, polyimide <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is chosen for ease of processing and to reduce parasitic capacitance in future applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Leak detector circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> was placed it in a PBS solution at 95&deg; C. and the resistance across the terminals was measured. To perform this test, a fully packaged hermetic biocompatible package <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was cut with a razor blade, removing the gold <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and polyimide <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, while keeping the resistor intact. Leak detector circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> was then glued to a metal hybrid package and a LABVIEW program was used to monitor resistance at 20-second intervals. The PBS solution was preheated for 3 hours to raise the temperature to 95&deg; C. and the program was then started. After 360 seconds, leak detector circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> was placed in the PBS solution. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the dynamic response of leak detector circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the PBS solution. After <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> seconds, there is a marked rise in resistance from 720&OHgr; to 11 k&OHgr;. This is close to the contact resistance of the PBS solution, which is substantially lower than the open circuit resistance. When leak detector circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is removed from the PBS solution, resistance is immeasurable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> According to a second embodiment of the present invention, a second set of packages was fabricated using a modified design both to try to minimize any failures and to improve the quality of the reliability data. The new set of packages was manufactured with sputtered SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as a dielectric spacer instead of polyimide. This inorganic film has been chosen to try to reduce the potential for outgassing or moisture trapping. While the deposition rate of sputtered SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is too low to ultimately be implemented in a useful product, it is envisioned that this film can be made much thicker by using an intermediate layer of evaporated glass, which will increase thickness without decreasing adhesion quality. Lifetime tests were conducted to measure the MTTF of 72 packaged saline sensors with SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as the dielectric. To further improve the quality of the tests, new stations were devised that utilize incubating dry baths to control heat. These stations, which can control temperature to within 0.1&deg; C., offer a marked improvement over the ovens previously used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Packages with a sputtered SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>dielectric performed worse than the devices with polyimide, with a shorter mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) at each temperature. The extracted MTTF at 37.5&deg; C. for this design has been determined to be about 30 years. Failed packages with sputtered SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>dielectrics showed no bubbling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to the principles of the present invention, a novel packaging technology based upon electroplated gold and polyimide is provided. The package utilizes a 3-micron thick polyimide layer encapsulated with 3 microns of gold. This technique is effective at hermetically sealing an implantable system. Furthermore, a novel integrated saline sensor that utilizes a thin metal film that is easily etched to measure moisture infusion into the package. This sensor readily lends itself to automated testing; through its use, we have shown preliminary data that suggests a mean time to failure at body temperature of 30 years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention has several important advantages. Since it utilizes a metal film, it can electromagnetically shield devices. This has applications in communications and military markets. Because the electroplating process is performed at the wafer level, it is possible to construct shielded packages at a fraction of the current cost. Expensive packages are a bottleneck in the production of many types of electronics. By integrating a hermetic, shielded package at the wafer level, it is possible to allow previously expensive circuits to be package in cheap non-hermetic plastic packages, which should substantially reduce cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to flow cytometry and, more specifically, to devices and methods for detection of flow cytometry samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Flow cytometry is a valuable method for the analysis and isolation of biological particles such as cells and constituent molecules. As such it has a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The method utilizes a fluid stream to linearly segregate particles such that they can pass, single file, through a detection apparatus. Individual cells can be distinguished according to their location in the fluid stream and the presence of detectable markers. Thus, a flow cytometer can be used to produce a diagnostic profile of a population of biological particles. For example, flow cytometry has been used to measure the decline or maintenance of immune cells during the course of treatment for HIV infection and to determine the presence or absence of tumor cells for prognosis and diagnosis of cancer patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Isolation of biological particles has been achieved by adding a sorting or collection capability to flow cytometers. Particles in a segregated stream, detected as having one or more desired characteristics, are individually isolated from the sample stream by mechanical or electrical removal. This method of flow sorting has been used to separate sperm bearing X and Y chromosomes for animal breeding, to sort chromosomes for genetic analysis, to isolate cells bearing specific antigens and to identify new organisms from complex biological populations. Although sorting capability can slow down the rate of sample analysis by a cytometer, cell sorters can be operated at rates allowing sorting of greater than 100,000 events per second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A majority of flow cytometry methods employ fluorescent detection of particles. In a few cases the intrinsic fluorescence of a particle can be used as a basis of detection. A more widely employed method is to detect a fluorescent label that binds to a specific molecule associated with a particle. For example, a cell expressing a specific antigen on its surface can be distinguished from non-antigen bearing cells in the same mixture using a flow cytometer. Specifically, the cell mixture can be incubated with a detectable antibody that binds specifically to the antigen and the mixture can be subsequently analyzed with a flow cytometer to uniquely identify the labeled cell. A sorting capability can further allow the labeled cell to be isolated from the mixture for therapeutic manipulation or further diagnostic analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In many cases it would also be useful to know how many molecules are present on, or in, each cell-in a mixture. The number of labeled molecules associated with a cell can be diagnostic of a response of the cell to various conditions such as disease state or exposure to a therapeutic compound. For example, specific immune cells present in response to various disease states can be distinguished based on the number of cell surface markers present. Thus, one goal of flow cytometry for both analytical and sorting applications is quantitative flow cytometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Quantitative flow cytometry refers to methods for correlating the intensity of detected signal with the quantity of labeled molecules on the particle. Quantitation can be achieved for an individual instrument, for example, by calibrating the instrument with optical test materials and producing empirical calibration curves for each new lot of reagents used. Standardized measurements are desired for accuracy and quality assurance in diagnosis and prognosis of human disease. However, expansion of quantitative flow cytometry to allow standardized measurements between instruments and labs has not been achieved despite attempts by a number of national and international programs. Variability between instruments and methods has been one drawback to standardization of quantitative flow cytometry between laboratories which could achieve the accuracy required for most clinical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, there exists a need for methods to standardize fluorescence measurements in flow cytometry. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related advantages as well. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a flow cytometer with detection optics oriented to measure radiation scatter intensity or fluorescence emission intensity independently of their degree of anisotropy. The intensity of scatter and emission for particles measured in a flow cytometer is generally dependent on the angle of detection and the degree of anisotropy of the radiation emitted or scattered by the particle. This anisotropic emission can present a problem for standardization or calibration of quantitative measurements. However, intensity of scattered and emitted radiation is independent of anisotropic radiation emission when detected at an angle of about 54.7&deg; from the direction of the excitation polarization. An advantage of this invention is that it provides a standardized observation direction and therefore makes it possible to compare the intensity of flow cytometry measurements with an objective standardized reference source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the invention provides a method of detecting emitted or scattered radiation from a sample that is independent of intensity variations due to anisotropic radiation emission. Specifically, the invention provides a method of detecting radiation from a sample at an angle of about 54.7&deg; from the direction of polarization. Additionally, the dependence of intensity on polarization angle and anisotropic radiation emission can be predicted for particles in a sample stream, for example, in a flow cytometer. Therefore, the invention also provides methods for determining a standardized intensity value based on the optical properties of a cytometer or photophysical properties of a particle. Accordingly, another advantage of the methods of the invention is that they allow determination of a standardized intensity value that can be compared between instruments as well as between fluorophores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;flow cytometer&rdquo; is intended to mean a device or apparatus having particles aligned in a sample stream such that the particles individually enter a zone of detection. A sample stream can include any mobile phase that passes particles in single file including, for example, a fluid stream or fluid jet. The term is intended to include any particle including one or more molecules. A particle including one molecule can be, for example, a fluorophore or a macromolecule such as a polynucleotide, polypeptide, or other organic or biological polymer. A particle including more than one molecule can be, for example, a cell, molecular complex or bead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;polarized,&rdquo; when used in reference to radiation, is intended to mean electromagnetic radiation having an electric field vector biased toward a uniform direction or enriched in one direction. The direction of polarization of electromagnetic radiation refers to the direction of the electric field vector relative to the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic radiation. A uniform electric field vector can be linearly fixed with respect to the direction of propagation or can rotate about the direction of propagation circularly or elliptically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;polarized radiation source&rdquo; is intended to mean a means for producing or selectively propagating electromagnetic radiation having an electric field vector biased toward a uniform direction or enriched in one direction. The term is intended to include all illumination sources including, for example, those producing electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and/or infrared regions of the spectrum. A radiation source can include, for example, a lamp such as an arc lamp or quartz halogen lamp, or a laser such as an ion laser, dye laser or diode laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;signal detector&rdquo; is intended to mean a device or apparatus that converts the energy of contacted photons into an electrical response. A signal detector can produce an electric current in response to impinging photons, for example, as in a photodiode or photomultiplier tube. A signal detector can also accumulate charge in response to impinging photons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;flow chamber&rdquo; is intended to mean an apparatus that can contain a sample stream such that radiation emitted or scattered by a particle in the sample stream can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;selective&rdquo; or &ldquo;selectively,&rdquo; when used in reference to detection of radiation, is intended to mean preferential detection of radiation having a particular property. The term can include detection of radiation having a particular property due to total or partial rejection of radiation having one or more other properties. The property of radiation can include, for example, direction of propagation or direction of polarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;sample&rdquo; is intended to mean a molecule, particle or mixture of molecules or particles. The term can include, for example, one or more particles suspended or solubilized in a liquid phase. As used herein, the term &ldquo;sample stream&rdquo; refers to particles that have a net directional flow. Particles having a net direction or flow can be contained, for example, in a mobile liquid phase. A mobile liquid phase can be in a state characterized, for example, as having laminar flow, sheath flow, or streamline flow. Alternatively, the liquid phase can be stationary and the particles can move through the liquid phase due to, for example, extrinsic force or pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;degree of polarization&rdquo; is intended to mean the value P in the equation P&equals;((&agr;&minus;&bgr;)/(&agr;&plus;&bgr;)), where &agr; is the intensity of detected irradiation having an electric field vector parallel to the electric field vector of radiation from a radiation source and &bgr; is the intensity of detected irradiation having an electric field vector orthogonal to the electric field vector of radiation from a radiation source. Scattered light can have a degree of polarization that is between &minus;1 and &plus;1. Irradiation produced by emission from a fluorophore excited by polarized light can have a degree of polarization that is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 0.5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a sample detection apparatus. The apparatus consists of a polarized radiation source, flow chamber and signal detector, the flow chamber being placed to contact polarized radiation from the polarized radiation source, the signal detector being placed to selectively detect radiation propagated from the flow chamber at about 54.7 degrees from the direction of polarization of the contacted polarized radiation. Also provided is a flow cytometer having the sample detection apparatus. The flow cytometer consists of a polarized radiation source, flow chamber and signal detector, the flow chamber being placed to contact polarized radiation from the polarized radiation source, the signal detector being placed to selectively detect radiation propagated from the flow chamber at about 54.7 degrees from the direction of polarization of the contacted polarized radiation. The sample detection apparatus can be placed in any flow cytometer to provide detection of emitted or scattered radiation intensity that is independent of anisotropic radiation emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When a fluorophore or other molecule emits fluorescence, it emits radiation in all directions. Anisotropic radiation emission refers to a difference in the amount of radiation emitted in different directions when fluorescence is induced by a polarized source. In contrast, isotropic emission refers to identical amounts of radiation emitted in all directions. Whether a fluorophore produces isotropic or anisotropic emission when irradiated by polarized radiation depends upon intrinsic properties of the fluorophore and mobility of the fluorophore. Further, the degree of anisotropic radiation emission can vary among anisotropic fluorophores, also due to intrinsic properties of the fluorophores or their mobility. As described below, fluorescence intensity measured at an arbitrarily chosen polarization angle, or at an arbitrary observation angle, can therefore depend on the degree of anisotropy in the distribution of emitting dipoles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Fluorescence intensity measured for an anisotropic sample can change with polarization angle or angle of emission such that intensities measured for the same sample at different angles of detection or for different samples having different degrees of anisotropic radiation emission, can be different. These differences are shown for the extreme case in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> where comparison of the intensity distribution for emission from an isotropic fluorophore is compared to the intensity distribution for emission from a maximally anisotropic fluorophore. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is one region where intensity is independent of anisotropic radiation emission. This region is at an angle about 54.7&deg; from the direction of polarization for radiation contacting the fluorophore. Thus, for a sample irradiated by a linearly polarized light source, intensity measurements can be made that are independent of anisotropic radiation emission when either a detector selectively collects radiation that is emitted in a direction of about 54.7&deg; from the direction of irradiation polarization or a polarizer with pass-axis at about 54.7&deg; from the direction of radiation polarization is placed in front of a detector. Measurements made in the above described geometries, are referred to herein as measurements at an anisotropic-independent angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will recognize that small variations in the angle of detection can be accommodated by the invention so long as the difference between the intensities measured at the variated angle and 54.7&deg; under otherwise similar conditions are indistinguishable or statistically meaningless. For example, the range of angles that provide anisotropic-independent detection for two samples can increase as the differences in the degrees of anisotropic radiation emission between the two samples decrease. One skilled in the art can determine an appropriate range for relative difference in intensities determined for anisotropic-independent detection as it can vary from 54.7&deg; using equation 1 and/or plots similar to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as described below. One skilled in the art will recognize that an angle that is about 54.7&deg; can include an angle in the range of about 53&deg; to about 57&deg;, for example, when resolution between detected intensities is relatively low. As resolution increases about 54.7&deg; can include a narrower range of angles such as about 54&deg; to about 56&deg;, or about 54.5&deg; to about 55&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a sample detection apparatus having a polarized light source and a signal detector at about 54.7 degrees with respect to the direction of polarization of the irradiation at the point of observation.

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A radiation source of the invention can be any source that produces linearly-polarized radiation. A radiation source useful in the invention includes, for example, a lamp such as an arc lamp, quartz halogen lamp, or deuterium lamp. Arc lamps include for example, mercury arc lamps or xenon arc lamps. One skilled in the art will know that an appropriate lamp can be chosen based on a variety of factors including, for example, average radiance across the spectrum, radiance in specific regions of the spectrum, presence of spectral lines, radiance at spectral lines, or arc size. A radiation source can also be a laser including, for example, an ion laser such as argon ion or krypton ion laser, Helium neon laser, helium cadmium laser, dye laser, YAG laser or diode laser. One skilled in the art can choose an appropriate laser or lamp according to desired properties such as those described above or in Shapiro, <highlight><italic>Practical flow cytometry, </italic></highlight>3<highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>Ed.

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A sample of the invention can include a particle or mixture of particles in a liquid phase. A sample detection apparatus of the invention can have a sample contained in a liquid stream where the particles have a net directional flow, for example, along the Z axis of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. One skilled in the art will recognize that the trajectory of the liquid stream in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> can be altered from that shown while still achieving detection at an anisotropic-independent angle. The liquid stream can be contained in a capillary. or in a stream in air system.

Particles that can be used in the invention also include submicroscopic particles such as proteins, nucleic acids, other organic or biological polymers or micelles. Manipulation and detection of samples in liquid streams can be performed as described, for example, in Shapiro, supra. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A detector that can be used in the invention includes any device that converts the energy of impinging radiation into a signal that can be subsequently manipulated or stored to determine the presence or quantity of an irradiated sample. A signal produced by a detector can be, for example, an electrical response. A signal detector can produce an electric current in response to impinging photons as occurs, for example, in a photodiode or photomultiplier tube. A signal detector can also accumulate charge in response to impinging photons as occurs, for example, in a charged coupled device. One skilled in the art will be able to choose a detector based on a variety of well known factors including, for example, compatibility with the radiation source used, sensitivity, spectral range of detection and compatibility with data processing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a sample detection apparatus, containing a flow chamber and a polarizer with its pass-axis oriented at about 54.7 degrees with respect to the direction of polarization of a radiation emitted from the flow chamber, the polarizer being placed between the radiation source and a detector. A device having a polarizer with pass-axis at about 54.7&deg; from the direction of radiation polarization placed in front of a detector is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. The device in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> has a radiation source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which produces radiation, linearly polarized along the Z axis that contacts a sample <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Radiation emitted from the sample <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, located at the origin of the three orthogonal axes, as fluorescence or scatter, passes through a polarizer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to a detector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The polarizer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a pass-axis angle of 54.7&deg; from the direction of radiation polarization. The detector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is shown orthogonal to the direction of radiation incidence. However, in contrast to the geometry in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, the detector in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> can be at any geometry from the direction of radiation polarization or incidence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A polarizer of the invention can be any material that selectively passes radiation having a uniform electric field vector biased in a uniform direction or enriched in one direction. Examples of polarizers that can be used in the invention include polarization filters such as those having oriented, optically active molecules or polarizing beamsplitters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An advantage of a device that detects intensity at an anisotropic-independent angle is that intensity is measured independent of polarization effects allowing a standardized intensity to be obtained for comparison between samples having different degrees of anisotropic radiation emission. In contrast, standard cytometers having detectors that are orthogonal to a radiation source detect different intensities depending on the degree of anisotropic radiation emission for each sample. Thus, two samples having the same molar absorption coefficient and fluorescence quantum yield, although having the same theoretical brightness, will yield inconsistent intensities if they have different degrees of anisotropic radiation emission and are measured in the above-described orthogonal arrangement. Additionally, the same detector measuring the same sample from different vantage points can detect different intensities when the sample has an anisotropic distribution of emitting dipoles. Thus, instruments having the same detector can measure different intensities for the same sample if they have different geometries. Detection at an anisotropic-independent angle provides a means to standardize intensity measurements, thereby avoiding differences due to polarization and/or detector geometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will recognize that the device shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> can be modified such that the geometry of one or more components is changed relative to any other component so long as the detector selectively detects either radiation that is emitted in a direction about 54.7&deg; from the direction of irradiation polarization or radiation passing a polarizer with pass-axis at about 54.7&deg; from the direction of radiation polarization. For example, a prism, mirror, or other light redirecting means can be used to orient components in a manner consistent with the present invention and convenient for a variety of instruments or applications as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The invention also includes a modification of a sample detection apparatus to produce detection at an anisotropic-independent angle. One skilled in the art will be able to modify a sample detection apparatus by routine methods to achieve the geometries described herein. For example, a sample detection apparatus in a flow cytometer can be modified to provide detection at an anisotropic-independent angle. A variety of flow cytometers that can be modified for detection at an anisotropic-independent angle are described, for example, in Shapiro, supra (1995). A common geometry for a flow cytometer detector has the detector, sample trajectory, and radiation source orthogonal to each other in three dimensions. This orthogonal geometry can be easily modified to achieve detection at a anisotropic-independent angle, for example, by swinging the detector relative to the direction of polarization or by rotating the direction of polarization relative to the direction of the detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Modifications can be made to a flow cytometer relative to the sample trajectory to achieve the geometries described herein. For example, flow cytometers in which the sample stream is irradiated with radiation having a direction of polarization parallel to the sample trajectory can be modified to detect at a anisotropic-independent angle. Therefore, the invention provides a flow cytometer having a sample stream with a trajectory orthogonal to the irradiation source and parallel to the direction of polarization and a point of observation of the signal detector placed about 54.7 degrees from a line parallel to the trajectory of the sample stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Additionally, for a specific example where a flow cytometer in which the sample stream, the main axis of the signal detector and the illumination beam are orthogonal with respect to each other, the direction of polarization of the radiation can be manipulated so that the signal intensity registered by the detector is independent of the degree of anisotropy of emitted radiation. A flow cytometer having this geometry can be modified, for example, such that mirrors or other apparatuses, that direct the irradiation beam towards the sample stream are positioned to turn the beam&apos;s direction of polarization 35.3 degrees from a line parallel to the trajectory of the sample stream. Accordingly, a flow cytometer having a sample stream placed to contact polarized radiation from the polarized radiation source and a signal detector placed to selectively detect radiation propagated from the sample stream at about 54.7 degrees from the direction of polarization of the contacted polarized radiation can have a sample stream with a trajectory orthogonal to the polarized radiation source. The sample stream can be orthogonal to the signal detector. Additionally, the polarization direction can be 35.3 degrees from a line parallel to the trajectory of the sample stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Similar modifications can be made to any sample detection apparatus. Thus, the invention provides a sample detection apparatus having a sample stream with a trajectory orthogonal to a signal detector and polarized radiation source, wherein the direction of polarization of the irradiation beam is 35.3 degrees from a line parallel to the trajectory of the sample stream. An example of a detection apparatus having the above described geometry is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C and includes a sample stream having a trajectory along the Z axis, a radiation source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> produces radiation that propagates in a direction that is orthogonal to the sample stream trajectory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The radiation propagating from the radiation source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is linearly polarized at an angle of 35.3&deg; from the Z axis which is parallel to the sample stream trajectory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A detector <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is placed orthogonal to the sample stream trajectory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and radiation source to selectively detect radiation emitted or scattered from the sample stream trajectory <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at an angle of 54.7&deg; from the direction of polarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A flow cytometer can also be modified to detect radiation at an anisotropic-independent angle by placing a polarizer between the sample and detector such that radiation having a pass-axis of about 54.7&deg; from the direction of polarization is selectively detected. One skilled in the art can routinely add a polarizer to a cytometer as described in Example I or by other methods well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a method of detecting fluorescent intensity for a sample in a flow cytometer independent of anisotropic radiation emission. The method includes the steps of: (a) contacting a sample in a flow cytometer with polarized radiation; and (b) detecting radiation emitted by the sample at about 54.7 degrees with respect to the direction of polarization of the polarized radiation at the point of sample contact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition to measuring intensities at an anisotropic-independent angle, a standardized intensity can also be determined according to the methods of the invention. Therefore, the invention provides a method for determining a standardized fluorescence intensity for a sample in a flow cytometer. The method includes the steps of (a) irradiating a sample with polarized radiation, and (b) detecting intensity of emission at an identified angle of detection-with respect to the direction of polarization of the irradiation, wherein a standardized fluorescence intensity comprises intensity of emission at the identified angle of detection with respect to the direction of polarization of the irradiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A standardized fluorescence intensity value is an intensity of fluorescence that can be compared between sample detection apparatuses having different geometries. A standardized fluorescence intensity can be determined, according to any relationship that accurately predicts relative intensity with polarization angle for a given sample. As described in Example I, the dependence of relative intensity on polarization angle for a sample in a flow cytometer can be accurately predicted by the following models. The model is based on the fact that when vertically polarized radiation hits a collection of randomly oriented dye molecules, photoselection occurs. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the resulting distribution of excited fluorophores is cylindrically symmetric and it contains many molecules with vertical or near-vertical absorption dipoles. When this collection of molecules emits fluorescence, the distribution of emitting dipoles will also be anisotropic and cylindrically symmetric. Equation 1 provides a relationship between the intensity of fluorescence (I) detected at an angle relative to the direction of laser polarization (&eegr;)</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> also described in Asbury et al. (2000), supra. Accordingly, Equations 2 and 3 are specific forms of equation 1. If &bgr;&equals;0, Equation 2 describes a source with perfect vertical polarization, for example along the z-axis as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. If &agr;&equals;0, the source has perfect horizontal polarization, for example, along the x-axis in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The variation in fluorescence intensity with polarization angle determined from equations 2 and 3 is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> which represents fluorescence intensity as the radial distance from the origin at specific polarization angles. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, variation of fluorescence intensity with polarization angle for the isotropic case yields a circular curve according to equation 3. For the maximally anisotropic case a bean shaped curve is produced according to equation 2. Comparison of the fluorescence intensity with polarization angle for the isotropic and maximally anisotropic case indicates that intensities will be independent of differences in anisotropic radiation emission of the samples at a polarization angle of 54.7&deg; from the direction of radiation polarization, as indicated by the line identified as the anisotropic-independent angle. One skilled in the art will recognize that according to the symmetry in the relationship of intensity to polarization angle for the two cases plotted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, an anisotropic-independent angle of about 54.7&deg; is equivalent to about 144.7&deg; when considered in a 180&deg; reference frame and equivalent to about 144.7&deg;, about 234.7&deg; and about 324.7&deg; when considered in a 360&deg; reference frame. The symmetry illustrated in 2 dimensions by the polar plot of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> can be extended to 3 dimensions because the anisotropic-independent angle is symmetric with respect to rotation about the laser polarization axis. Thus, the anisotropic-independent angle corresponds to two cones radiating from the angle of polarization at about 54.7&deg; and about 144.7&deg;, respectively. This invention is described in a 90&deg; reference frame, thereby including the above described angles when described in other reference frames. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The mathematics leading to Equations 2 and 3 can also be used to determine how the total fluorescence intensity, measured without a polarizer, varies as the angle of observation is changed. In this case, the symbol &eegr; is taken to represent the angle between the detection axis and vertical. The variation of intensity with angle of observation (I<highlight><subscript>OA</subscript></highlight>) for a maximally anisotropic fluorophore is described by equation 4,</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> and for an isotropic fluorophore is described by equation 5,</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The variation in fluorescence intensity with angle of emission is plotted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, variation of fluorescence intensity with angle of emission for the isotropic case yields a circular curve according to equation 5. For the maximally anisotropic case a bean shaped curve is produced according to equation 4. Comparison of the fluorescence intensity with polarization angle for the isotropic and maximally anisotropic cases indicates that intensities will be independent of differences in anisotropic radiation emission of the samples at an angle of emission of about 54.7&deg; from the direction of radiation polarization, as indicated by the line identified as a anisotropic-independent angle. As described above a anisotropic-independent angle includes equivalent angles identifiable by symmetry from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> According to the methods of the invention a standardized intensity can be determined for any sample in any flow cytometer. For example, a standardized intensity can be determined for the same sample measured in cytometers having different detector geometries by applying the above models. As demonstrated in Example I, the dependence of intensity on polarization angle or angle of emission can be empirically determined for a sample. The data can be fitted to equation 1 to determine values of &agr; and &bgr;. Based on the equation having the &agr; and &bgr; values determined for the sample and an intensity measured in a detector at a known angle &eegr;, relative intensity values for the sample can be calculated for any angle &eegr;. Thus, intensities for a sample measured with detectors having different geometries can be compared and standardized by reference to the appropriate derivative of equation 1. One skilled in the art will recognize that a similar method can be used to determine a standardized intensity for different samples. For example, the standardized intensity values determined as described above, can be compared between different samples by appropriate correlation of intensities with respect to photophysical properties of the samples such as molar absorption coefficient and fluorescence quantum yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the invention provides a method for determining a standardized fluorescence intensity for a sample in a flow cytometer. The method includes the steps of: (a) determining intensity of radiation emitted from a sample in a flow cytometer at two or more angles with respect to the direction of polarization for a radiation source; (b) determining values of &agr; and &bgr; for the sample according to the equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>I</italic></highlight>(&eegr;)&equals;&agr;*cos<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>&eegr;&plus;&bgr;*sin<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>&eegr;,</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> wherein I(&eegr;) is intensity of fluorescence at an angle &eegr; relative to the direction of polarization, &agr; is intensity of vertically polarized fluorescence and &bgr; is intensity of horizontally polarized fluorescence; and (c) determining fluorescence intensity at a different angle of detection compared to the two or more angles according to the equation, wherein the equation comprises the determined values of &agr; and &bgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a method for determining that scattered irradiation passes through a filter by determining degree of polarization through a filter, wherein a degree of polarization greater than 0.5 indicates scatter through the filter. As described above, the polarization behaviors of scatter and fluorescence are very different. Specifically, the polarization value, P can not be greater than 0.5 for fluorescent emission, but P can be any value between &minus;1 and &plus;1 for scattered radiation. Therefore, detection of a P value greater than 0.5 for radiation passing through a filter from an irradiated sample indicates passage or leak of scattered irradiation through the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> An advantage of using the method to determine that scattered radiation passes through a filter is that an appropriate filter can be chosen for a particular application. One approach is to compare the apparent degree of polarization from a particular irradiated sample using several filters and to identify a trend in scatter blocking ability as described in Example II. A filter can be chosen which passes the most radiation relative to the others, while having a degree of polarization that is indicative of desired scatter blocking ability. A desired scatter blocking ability can be identified as the lowest P value in a set of filters or as a desired P value. A desired P value for fluorescence emitted by a sample can be determined as a P value for radiation emitted from the sample when scattered radiation is effectively blocked as described, for example, in Example II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a method for determining scatter through a filter by determining apparent polarization direction of light passing through a filter at two laser polarization directions, wherein a change in apparent polarization direction for the two laser polarization directions indicates scatter through the filter. When rotation is in the plane defined by the direction of polarization of the laser and the detection axis, the polarization direction of pure fluorescence will not change, so that any change in the apparent polarization direction indicates that scatter is leaking through the filter. A quantitative measure of laser-blocking efficiency for specific filter combinations can be obtained from such data, thereby allowing objective evaluation of filter sets. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates methods to determine the effects of anisotropic radiation emission in a flow cytometer. The example also demonstrates that intensity distributions in plots of intensity versus polarization angle closely follow equation 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As described below, polarization state was determined by rotating a polarizer in front of a detector. The orientation of the polarizer and the intensity passing the polarizer were recorded simultaneously. The polarizer was rotated during data collection. The distribution of intensity versus polarization angle for a population of particles was obtained. Intensity distributions were plotted in polar coordinates. A curve-fitting procedure was used to calculate the degree of polarization for the population. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Polar plots of intensity versus polarization angle for light scattered from uniform beads are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The measured intensity distributions followed Equation 2 very closely. Regardless of the direction of polarization of the laser, scattered light exhibited a very high degree of polarization, with values of P greater than 0.83. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, scatter was perfectly polarized (P&tilde;1.00) when the laser polarization was vertical, indicating that depolarized light from multiple reflections and aperture depolarization made a negligible contribution in this case. When the laser polarization was rotated, these depolarizing effects made a slightly more significant contribution, as indicated by the decrease in the degree of scatter polarization in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Upon 488-nm excitation, the fluorescence from the beads was moderately polarized with P&equals;0.194&plusmn;0.003 as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>. Repeated measurements (N&equals;28) of bead fluorescence at this excitation wavelength demonstrated excellent reproducibility with average P&equals;0.189, and standard deviation, &sgr;<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.011. P values were independent of laser power between 65 and 255 mW and independent of photomultiplier control voltage between 0.2 and 0.6 V. Unlike scatter, the main direction of fluorescence polarization did not rotate when the laser polarization was rotated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference> shows that, only the degree of fluorescence polarization changed, decreasing toward P&tilde;0.00 as the laser polarization became parallel with the detection axis. The degree of fluorescence polarization from these beads depended on the excitation wavelength. Upon UV excitation, bead fluorescence was only weakly polarized at P&equals;0.052&plusmn;0.002. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The above measurements were made with the flow cytometer described previously in Asbury et al., <highlight><italic>Cytometry </italic></highlight>24:234-242 (1996) and van den Engh et al., <highlight><italic>Cytometry </italic></highlight>10:282-293 (1989) and the following conditions. Fluidic and optical components were mounted on an optical bench, allowing easy access to and modification of the instrument. A 70-&mgr;m nozzle operating at 210 kPa (30 psi) produced a jet velocity of &tilde;20 m/s. Samples were injected into the center of the stream through a PEEK capillary tube (Upchurch, Oak Harbor, Wash.) with an internal diameter. of 250 &mgr;m. Two argon lasers were used, which were tuned for multiline UV (model Innova 307;Coherent, Santa Clara, Calif.) and single-line visible excitation (model lnnova 306). Typically, the lasers were adjusted to produce 100 mW or less. Lasers were usually polarized vertically, parallel to the jet, except in a few experiments when the laser polarization was rotated using a half-wave retarder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Light emitted from the laser crossing-point was focused onto a pinhole mirror as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> using an objective lens with 0.42 NA (20&times;M Plan Apo, model 378-8042; Mitutoyo, Japan). At this low numerical aperture, aperture depolarization effects are expected to be minimal. The pinhole acted as a spatial filter. Light passing through the pinhole was collimated by a lens (f&equals;75 mm) before passing through color filters and entering the polarizer (described below). Light reflected by the pinhole mirror was imaged onto a CCD camera and displayed on a video monitor, allowing continuous visual inspection of the alignment of stream, laser, and pinhole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The electronics of the machine have been described in van den Engh et al., (1989) supra. The system can accept up to eight input signals. The inputs can either measure DC levels or pulse heights. Pulsed inputs are filtered using baseline-restoration circuitry before analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion to remove background from the pulsed light signals coming from measured particles. DC inputs are used to record continuous signals in the data list including, for example, laser power, temperature, or other externally varying parameters as described in Asbury et al., (1996), supra and are fed directly into A/D converters without baseline-restoration. For the measurements described in this example, the angle of the polarizer was voltage encoded and stored using one of the DC inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The polarizer was attached to the flow cytometer as follows. A Glan-Taylor polarizer (03PTA401; Melles Griot, Irvine, Calif.) was mounted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> into the center of a rigid wheel that could be rotated 260&deg;. A rotary potentiometer in a voltage divider circuit produced a voltage signal that varied linearly (between 0 and 5 V) with the angle of the prism. Light passing through the polarizer was collected with a photomultiplier (H95746;Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, N.J.). Photomultiplier output current was amplified with a custom-built preamp before connection to one of the pulse inputs of the electronics as described in van den Engh et al., (1989) supra. Colored glass or interference filters were placed in front of the polarizer to select the appropriate fluorescence or scatter wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> For one experiment, data were collected by placing a 50% plate beamsplitter (03BTFOO7; Melles Griot) at 45&deg; incidence in front of the polarizer. By convention, the plane of incidence for the beamsplitter is defined as that including the normal to the reflecting surface and the direction of the incident beam. P-polarized light refers to light polarized parallel to this plane of incidence and s-polarized refers to light polarized perpendicular to it. No beamsplitters were included in the detection path for any of the remaining experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The measurement procedure and analysis were performed as follows. The sample consisted of fluorescent microspheres (Fluoresbrite YG, cat. no.18860; Polysciences, Warrington, Pa.) diluted 1:100 in distilled water prior to analysis. The polarizer was rotated manually during data acquisition. Both the angle of the polarizer and the light intensity collected after the polarizer were recorded for every measured particle. For each anisotropy calculation, a data list was collected including 40,000 particles distributed evenly over the 260&deg; range of the rotating polarizer. A bivariate dot-plot of fluorescence intensity versus polarization angle for calibration beads is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and demonstrates the sinusoidal variation predicted by Equation 2. A vertical slice through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> at a given angle would reveal a distribution of intensities due to variation in particle brightness and to the overall precision limit of the system. In order to compress the raw data into a single curve, one intensity value was computed for each angle by taking the peak of the distribution after smoothing with a 10-channel sliding window. This process resulted in about 250 point pairs (angle x<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, intensity I<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) summarizing the dataset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The Levenberg-Marquardt method of nonlinear least squares fitting was used to compute the best-fit of Equation 2 to the point pairs. The Levenberg-Marquardt method of nonlinear least squares fitting has been described previously in Press et al., <highlight><italic>Numerical recipes in C: the art of scientific computing, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Ed., Cambridge University Press, Oxford (1992). Four adjustable parameters were included in the fit. Two were the coefficients of cos<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>&eegr;</subscript></highlight> and sin<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>&eegr;</subscript></highlight>, &agr; and &bgr;, which were used to compute P. Two additional parameters, a gain and an offset, were used to calibrate the angle measurement by converting x in arbitrary units into &eegr; in degrees. New values for these two parameters were obtained each time the instrument was set up by measuring highly vertically polarized light and allowing the fitting routine to adjust all four parameters. For subsequent datasets, the same angle calibration could be used by keeping the gain and offset fixed and allowing the fitting routine to adjust only &agr; and &bgr;. The point pairs and best-fit curves for each dataset were normalized by dividing intensities by (&agr;&plus;&bgr;) and plotted in polar coordinates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Uncertainties in the fitted parameters &agr; and &bgr; were calculated by assuming that intensities were normally distributed around the best-fit curve and using the chi-square value as a measure of the width of the normal distribution as described on page 661 of Press et al., (1992) supra. Uncertainties in P were then calculated by standard propagation of error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> This Example has demonstrated the dependence of detected intensity on polarization angle for both fluorescence and scatter produced by samples in a flow cytometer. The results indicate that equation 2 can be useful in determining a standard intensity value that can be compared between instruments having different configurations, for example, with respect to detection angle or polarizer angle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Selection of Laser-Blocking Filters </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates the use of polarization measurements to determine laser-blocking efficiency of filters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The accuracy of fluorescence polarization measurements depends on the extent to which laser scatter is blocked from the detector. Measured polarization values changed depending on laser-blocking efficiency of a series of long-pass filters. Specifically, measured polarization values were as follows: a 500LP filter, P&equals;0.8; 520LP filter, P&equals;0.28; 530LP filter, P&equals;0.2; 550LP filter, P&equals;0.2; and 488RB filter, P&equals;0.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The 500LP through 550LP filters were purchased from Edmund Scientific (Barrington, N.J.) and the 488RB, rejection-band laser-blocking filter was purchased from Chroma Technology (Brattleboro, Vt.). Measurements were made with the flow cytometer conditions and analysis methods described in Example I. Calibration bead samples were prepared as described in Example I. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Using a long-pass 500LP filter, the apparent polarization of calibration beads was far above the theoretical limit for fluorescence, indicating that 488-nm laser scatter was leaking through the filter. In this case, the measured light was a super-position of scatter and fluorescence, resulting in a P value above 0.5 which is the theoretical limit for fluorescence. As filters were chosen with increasing (red-shifted) cut-on wavelengths, laser scatter was blocked more completely and measured values approached the true polarization of pure fluorescence from these beads. The 488RB filter blocked the laser very efficiently and had a very sharp cut-on at &tilde;495nm. Measurement with this filter gave the same P value as with the 550LP indicating that the 550LP effectively blocked detection of scattered laser light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The results demonstrate that differences in polarization behaviors of scatter and fluorescence provide sensitive criteria with which to determine whether laser scatter leaks through a colored filter. The trend for longer (redder) cut-on wavelengths to give lower polarization is mostly due to differences in the laser-blocking efficiency of this series of filters, because polarization measured with the 488RB filter was the same as with the 550LP. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Effects of Beamsplitters on Polarization Measurements </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates that beamsplitters used in cytometry have transmissivities that depend strongly on the polarization state of the incident beam and on the orientation of the splitter with respect to the direction of polarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The effects of two different achromatic beamsplitters on polarization were investigated using fluorescence from calibration beads. Beamsplitters were found to produce orientation-dependent polarization artifacts. Comparison of polar plots of relative intensity versus polarization angle for bead fluorescence measured with and without a beamsplitter indicated that when a beamsplitter was placed in front of the polarizer at 45&deg; incidence and oriented to reflect vertically, the transmitted light was more polarized than without the beamsplitter. With the beamsplitter oriented to reflect horizontally, the transmitted light was less polarized than without the beamsplitter and exhibited a negative polarization. The ratio of transmission of p-polarized to s-polarized light for the 45&deg; beamsplitter was calculated to be T<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>/T<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>&equals;1.64&plusmn;0.05 using the data from the respective polar plots. A non-polarizing cube beamsplitter had a weaker effect on the transmitted light, but still showed some polarization sensitivity having T<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>/T<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>&equals;1.12&plusmn;0.03. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The plate beamsplitter transmitted p-polarized light 64% more efficiently than s-polarized light. Dichroic beamsplitters are known to have similar polarization sensitivity as evident from differences in the transmission and reflection spectra for p and s polarized light produced by commercially available dichroic beamsplitters. Chromatic properties of various dichroic beamsplitters are available from the respective manufacturers (Melles Groit, Irvine, Calif.; Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, Vt.). A so-called non-polarizing beamsplitter cube (12106, Newport Corp, Irvine Calif.) exhibited a 12% difference in transmission between the s- and p-polarizations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Measurements were made with the flow cytometer conditions and analysis methods described in Example I. Calibration bead samples were prepared as described in Example I. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Significant polarization was exhibited by all dyes tested. The degree of fluorescence polarization from the surface marker anti-CD4-FITC and all the DNA-bound dyes was high (P&gE;0.25). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The high degree of polarization observed for DNA dyes is due to the rigidity and relative immobility of the large DNA molecules to which they are bound which hinders depolarization due to molecular movement. In addition to molecular movement, depolarization can occur through energy transfer. The lower polarization of dimeric DNA dyes (TOTO, ETHD, and YOYO) relative to monomeric dyes (TO, EB, and PI) indicate that intramolecular energy transfer occurs between the dimerized chromophores. Energy transfer can also be responsible for the very low polarization exhibited by the antibody-bound fluorophore, anti-CD8-PE, as compared to anti-CD4-FITC. These dyes are expected to have similar mobilities and fluorescence lifetimes, but unlike fluorescein (FITC), each PE molecule contains several closely linked fluorescent groups. Energy transfer can occur very readily between these groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Measurements were made with the flow cytometer conditions and analysis methods described in Example I. Samples were prepared as follows. Mouse thymocytes were harvested from B1O.PL(73NS)/Sn mice, centrifuged, and resuspended at &tilde;1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml in Dulbecco&apos;s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.1, cat. no. 14080-055; Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.). The cytoplasmic dye, fluorescein diacetate (FDA, cat. no. 20164-2; Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.) was added, and the living cells were incubated for 30 min at 37&deg; C. and analyzed immediately. For labeling CD4 and CD8 cell surface receptors, the thymocytes were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies in staining buffer (PBS with 0.05% sodium azide and 5% fetal bovine serum) for 1.5 h at room temperature, washed twice by centrifugation, and then fixed by addition of 1% formaldehyde. Antibodies conjugated to fluorescein (anti-CD4-FITC) and phycoerythrin (anti-CD8-PE) were purchased from Pharmingen (cat. nos. 09424D and 01045B; San Diego, Calif.). The thiazole orange derivative, TO-PRO-l iodide (TO), ethidium bromide (EB), propidium iodide (PI), TOTO-I iodide (TOTO), ethidium-homodimer-1 (ETHD), and YOYQ-1 iodide (YOYO) were incubated with thymocytes in PBS with added detergent (0.05% Triton-X to permeabilize membranes) and RNAse (50 pg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature prior to analysis. The DNA dyes were purchased from Molecular Probes (cat. nos. T-3602, E-3565, P-3566, T-3600, E-1169, and Y-3601; Eugene, OR). All procedures regarding the use of animals were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Washington. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Mesoporous hexagonal, cubic or wormhole aluminosilicates derived from zeolite seeds using an ionic structure directing agent are described. The aluminum in the structures is stable so that the framework of the structures does not collapse when heated in the presence of water or water vapor (steam). The steam stable aluminosilicates can be used as acid catalysts for hydrocarbon conversions, including the fluidized bed catalytic cracking and the hydrocracking of petroleum oils, and other cracking of organic compounds. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to mesoporous aluminosilicate compositions which have a unique structure which are stable at high temperatures and under hydrothermal conditions. In particular, the present invention relates to a process for producing the mesoporous aluminosilicate composition which uses a zeolite seed with a structure directing agent. Further still, the present invention relates to novel cracking catalysts for oil and other organic molecules. The present invention thus provides for the assembly of ultrastable mesoporous aluminosilicates with hexagonal, cubic and wormhole framework structures that do not suffer from the undesirable extensive de-alumination and steam instability of conventional aluminosilicate mesostructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> All previously reported aluminosilicate mesostructures, as prepared by either direct or post synthesis alumination, results in the extensive de-alumination of the framework upon calcination (Ryoo, R., et al., Chem. Commun. 2225 (1997); and Luan, Z. H., et al., J. Phys. Chem. 99 10590 (1995)). This undesired property has been attributed to the hydrolysis of the framework Al by steam generated in the calcination process (Corma, A., et al., J. Catal. 148 569 (1994); and Luan, Z. H., et al., J. Phys. Chem. 99 10590 (1995)). Regardless of the mechanism responsible for the de-alumination process, the acid catalytic properties of these materials for organic chemical conversions is greatly compromised. Moreover, all previously reported aluminosilicate mesostructures completely lose their framework mesoporosity when exposed to steam at the temperatures normally encountered in the processing of petroleum catalysts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Soon after the discovery of mesoporous MCM-41 molecular sieves (Beck, J. S., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114 10834 (1992)), it was found that the incorporation of aluminum into the framework introduced mild acidic-functionality, but the long range order and tetrahedral siting of the aluminum was compromised (Chen, C- Y., et al., Microporous Mater. 2 17 (1993); Borade, R. B., et al., Catal. Lett 31 267 (1994); Luan, Z. H., et al., J. Phys. Chem. 99 10590 (1995)), especially at intended aluminum loadings above about 8 mol %. Mild acidity and loss of structural integrity, together with poor steam stability under regeneration conditions made hexagonal Al-MCM-41 compositions unattractive candidates for the processing of high molecular weight petroleum fractions. More recently, important advances have been made in improving the structural integrity of Al-MCM-41 through direct assembly (Janicke, M. T., et al., Chem. Mater. 11 1342 (1999)) and post synthesis modification methods (Hamdan, H., et al., J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans 92 2311 (1996); Mokaya, R., et al., Chem. Commun. 2185 (1997); Ryoo, R., et al., J. Chem. Commun. 2225 (1997); and Ryoo, R., et al., Chem. Mater. 9 1607 (1998)). However, the low acidity and poor steam stability still limit potential applications in petroleum refining (Corma, A., Chem. Rev. 2373 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There is thus a need for improved aluminosilicate compositions that are stable, particularly in the presence of steam. In particular, the present invention relates to aluminosilicates that have stable framework structures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> This invention provides the structurally distinct families of mesoporous aluminosilicates that are stable solid acid catalysts under the harsh steaming conditions encountered in the regeneration of the catalyst in processes such as the refining of petroleum. This result has been achieved without added reagent or processing costs in comparison to the costs for producing conventional mesostructures. The large framework pore sizes (2.0-10.0 nm) make these new materials especially desirable as cracking catalysts or hydrocracking catalysts for the refining of &ldquo;heavy crudes&rdquo; containing very high molecular weight fractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The approach for making ultrastable aluminosilicate mesostructures is to prepare first a reaction mixture of nanometer-sized anionic aluminosilicate clusters that contain primarily four-coordinated aluminum and silicon as linked tetrahedral AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units. These nanoclustered aluminosilicate anions are then further linked into a mesoporous framework structure through supramolecular assembly reaction in the presence of a structure-directing surfactant, most preferably a quaternary ammonium ion surfactant. The surfactant can contain ammonium, phosphonium or arsonium ions in an organic molecule. The displacement of alkali metal ions, organic ions and surfactant from the as-made mesostructure provides a mesoporous structure with unique thermal and hydrothermal stability in comparison to previously disclosed aluminosilicate mesostructures. Most preferred are the mesoporous structures obtained by displacing the sodium ions, organic ions and most of the surfactant by treatment with a solution of ammonium ions (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>). The calcination of these NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-exchanged forms of the compositions at temperatures above about 500&deg; C. removes residual surfactant and converts the ammonium ions to protons, thus affording a stable solid acid for catalyzing a variety of organic chemical conversions, especially alkylation reactions, isomerization reactions, cracking reactions, hydrocracking reactions, and hydrotreating reactions. The resulting acidic compositions can be easily incorporated as an active component of a conventional catalyst particle to improve catalytic conversions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In particular, an enhancement in the catalytic performance properties of FCC (fluidized bed catalytic cracking) particles can be expected by incorporating into the particle matrix the steam-stable mesoporous compositions of the present invention as a component capable of cracking a high fraction of the petroleum that comprises the resid or heavy end fraction of the petroleum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The nanoclustered aluminosilicate anions used to form the stable mesostructures of this invention are known in the art of zeolite chemistry as nucleating agents or, more generally, as &ldquo;zeolite seeds&rdquo;. They are given this term because they can be crystallized into a specific atomically ordered zeolite upon aging them as a solution, gel, or wet solid at elevated temperatures. In addition, some zeolite seeds can promote the nucleation and crystallization of a specific zeolite when they are added in small amounts to reaction mixtures of silicate and aluminate ions that would not normally form the desired zeolite of interest under equivalent conditions in the absence of the added seeds. In general, zeolite seeds can have two physical forms, namely, they can be in the form of sub-micrometer crystalline particles of the same zeolite that they nucleate, or they can be amorphous nanoclusters in solution, gel or solvent-suspended form. The sub-micrometer forms are often referred to as crystalline &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; whereas the amorphous nanoclustered forms are often called &ldquo;nucleating centers, gels, solutions, agents ,etc.&rdquo; For instance, Lechert et al. Stud. Surf. Sci. Catal., 84,147(1994) distinguishes between crystalline and amorphous gel forms of nucleating agents for type Y zeolites seeds. For the purposed of presenting the art of the present invention, however, we refer to both forms of these zeolite nucleating reagents as &ldquo;zeolite seeds&rsquo; or simply &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; whether they are sub-micrometer crystals or amorphous nanoclusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Zeolite seeds are formed by aging mixtures of silicate anions and aluminate anions under conditions of basic pH and, normally, elevated temperatures in the presence of specific inorganic and organic cations. The cations are selected so that they act as &ldquo;templates&rdquo; or, more precisely, as structure directors in forming the seeds. For example, the use of inorganic cations to form seeds of zeolite Y, more precisely the seeds of faujasitic zeolites, has been disclosed by Robson ACS Sym. Ser., 398,436 (1989), by Vaughan et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,178,352 (1979), Lechert et al, Stud. Sur. Sci. Catal., 84, 147 (1994), and by U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,574,538 and 3,808,326 to McDaniel et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,191 to Maher et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,789,107 to Elliott. The use of organic cations to form seeds of many different families of zeolites have been described by Lok et al. Zeolites, 3, 282 (1983); J. N. Watson et al. J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. (94) 2181 (1998); P. P. E. A. deMoor, et al. Chem. Mater. (11) 36 (1999); P. P. E. A. de Moor, et al. J. Phys. Chem. B (103) 1639 (1999) and S. I. Zones et al., Microporous Mesoporous. Mater. 21, 199(1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The structures of amorphous nanoclustered seeds is unknown, but it is presumed that the nanoclusters contain linkages of SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra that resemble the secondary building blocks found in crystalline zeolites. These secondary building blocks may contain rings of a specific number of space filling oxygen atoms that bridge the tetrahedrally coordinated silicon and aluminum centers, such as single and double 4-rings, 5-rings, 6-rings, and the like. Whatever the structure or connectivity of the SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units in nanoclustered aluminosilicate seeds may be, they are powerful structure-directing reagents in the nucleation of zeolite phases. The nanoclusters may be regarded as being &ldquo;proto-zeolitic&rdquo; by bearing a structure or tetrahedral building block connectivity that readily promotes zeolite crystallization. The art of the present invention discloses that these same protozeolitic seeds are preferred precursors for the supramolecular assembly of highly stable mesostructured aluminosilicate molecular sieves, even though the framework walls remain largely disordered in comparison to the atomically well-ordered framework walls of conventional zeolites. However, we do not exclude from the disclosed art the use of crystalline sub-micron zeolite seeds as precursors to the assembly of stable mesostructured aluminosilicate molecular sieves. Such small crystalline zeolite seeds can be transformed, at least in part, into stable framework wall-forming substructures under the conditions used to assemble a mesostructure. In addition, crystalline zeolite seeds may be admixed with amorphous nanoclustered seeds. Indeed, the residual crystalline zeolite seeds could even become embedded in the walls of the stabilized aluminosilicate mesostructures formed from the amorphous cluster fraction of the seed precursors. Mesostructures with such biphasic walls could have useful properties as catalysts for size dependent sequential chemical conversions, such as the cracking reactions involved in the refining of petroleum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The structural order, acidity and steam stability of hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructures all can be substantially improved through the assembly of nanoclustered precursors that normally nucleate the crystallization of microporous zeolites, particularly zeolites type Y and ZSM-5. These zeolite seeds are presumed to promote zeolite nucleation by adopting AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra connectivities that resemble the secondary structural elements in a crystalline zeolite. Assembling these same zeolite seeds into a mesostructure imparts acidity and hydrothermal stability that begin to approach zeolites, even though the framework walls remain in large part atomically disordered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The assembly of hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructures from zeolite seeds according to the teachings of this invention is not limited to zeolite Y formed from inorganic cations or to ZSM-5 seeds formed from organic cations. Any zeolite seed composition can be used to form aluminosilicate mesostructures with a hydrothermal stability that is substantially improved in comparison to the same mesostructures prepared from conventional precursors. The literature discloses numerous examples of organic molecules and ions that organize (or &ldquo;template&rdquo;) silicate and aluminate anions into nanoclustered units that seed the nucleation of crystalline zeolites (see, for example, B. M. Lok, et al. Zeolites (3) 282 (1983); R. E. Boyett, et al., Zeolites (17) 508 (1996); S. I. Zones, et al. Microporous Mesoporous Mater. (21) 199 (1998)). All of these zeolite seed compositions formed from organic templating agents are preferred precursors for the surfactant-directed supramolecular assembly of aluminosilicate mesostructures with enhanced hydrothermal stabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The assembly of zeolite seeds, particularly amorphous nanoclustered seeds, into a mesoporous framework causes the framework aluminum to remain in large part tetrahedral as AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units even after calcination. Also, the siting of the aluminum is more like that found in a hydrothermally stable zeolite, as indicated by the aluminum nmr chemical shift. By doing so, up to 35 mol % aluminum can be easily incorporated into hexagonal and wormhole silicate frameworks, denoted MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>and MSU-S<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>, respectively. Up to 13% Al was incorporated into cubic silicate mesostructures, denoted MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>. More importantly, at least half and more typically more than 75% or even 90% of the aluminum sites remain tetrahedral after calcination at 540&deg; C. Also the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-NMR chemical shift, as well as the shape and width of the resonance, was very similar to that of microporous zeolite Y. These latter results indicate that the local structure of the aluminum is analogous to that found in one of the most stable and most widely used zeolites in the petrochemical industry. Thus, these new ultrastable mesostructures with pore sizes in the range 2.0 to 15 nm are very useful for many applications where zeolite Y and other zeolites cannot be used because of a limited pore size below 1.0 nm. In addition, the structures remain stable even after treatment in 20% steam at 800&deg; C. for up to 5 hours, making them suitable for cracking or hydrocracking of high molecular weight petroleum fractions that cannot be processed by zeolite Y. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructures with Si/Al ratios in the range 80-2.0 have been assembled from aluminosilicate nanoclusters that normally nucleate the crystallization of zeolites type Y and ZSM-5. The aluminum content can be made very low in the case of ZSM-5 seeds increasing the Si/Al ratio to a value of 1000 and beyond. The calcined hexagonal mesostructures of this invention, denoted Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, are well-ordered, and structurally stable when exposed to 20% steam at 8000C for 5 hours. Al MAS NMR chemical shifts indicate that, unlike mesostructures assembled from conventional precursors, the mean Al&mdash;O&mdash;Si angle is similar to the value found for many crystalline zeolites. The steam stability of 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, together with an intrinsic acidity sufficient to crack cumene over the temperature range 300-450&deg; C., suggests that nanoclustered zeolite seeds are promising precursors for the design of hydrothermally stable mesostructures for the acid-catalyzed processing of high molecular weight petroleum fractions that cannot be adequately refined over microporous zeolites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Three structurally relevant properties embody the stable mesostructured aluminosilicate compositions of this invention from previously disclosed mesostructures. In the first general structural embodiment of the invention, the preferred compositions prepared from zeolite seeds have an experimentally observed <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift in the range 57-65 ppm relative to an aqueous 1.0 M aluminum nitrate as an external chemical shift reference. This is the chemical shift range that is found for many crystalline zeolite, including zeolite Y and other faujasitic zeolites. All previously reported mesostructured aluminosilicates prepared from conventional silicate and aluminate precursors, including the original Al-MCM-41 compositions of Beck et al., exhibit a chemical shift of 53-56 ppm. Chemical shift values in the range of 57-65 ppm are indicative of a zeolite-like connectivity of the SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and the AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units that comprise the framework walls of the mesostructures, even though the framework walls are largely disordered. We postulate that the zeolitic connectivity of the said tetrahedral units contributes substantially to the improvement in the hydrothermal stability of these preferred mesostructured compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the second structural embodiment, the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shifts of the preferred compositions fall in the range of previously disclosed mesostructured aluminosilicate compositions, namely, 53-56 ppm, but are distinguish by the presence of an infrared adsorption band in the frequency range 500-600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and by the retention of at least 80% of the initial framework mesopore volume is retained when the composition is exposed to boiling water for 5 hours or to 20% steam at 600&deg; C. for 5 hours. The infrared band at 500-600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>is indicative of the presence of zeolite-like secondary building blocks (e.g., 5-membered or 6-membered ring structures ) in the amorphous framework walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the third structural embodiment, the preferred aluminosilicate compositions of this invention are free of sodium exchange cations, exhibit a zeolite-like <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift in the range 57 to 65 ppm, and contain between 0.01 and 10 wt % carbon embedded in the framework mesopores. The sodium ions in the as-made mesostructures are displaced by ion exchange reaction with an ammonium salt, most preferably ammonium nitrate, in aqueous solution in the presence of the structure directing surfactant in the framework mesopores This exchange reaction also displaces a substantial amount of surfactant from the mesopores. Subsequent to the ion exchange reaction with ammonium ions, the mesostructure is calcined in air at a temperature sufficient to remove the remaining surfactant and to convert the ammonium exchange ions to protons, most preferably at a temperature of 540&deg; C. for a period of about 5 hours. This calcination procedure converts some of the remaining framework surfactant to carbon, presumably through cracking reactions of the surfactant in the acidic mesopores of the framework. The embedded carbon, which can amount to 0.01 to 10 wt % of the calcined mesostructure depending on calcination conditions, plays an important role in the hydrothermal stability of the mesostructures, presumably by reinforcing the framework against collapse under hydrothermal conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In view of the importance of the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift measurements in characterizing the preferred compositions of this invention, we briefly describe the measurement of this diagnostic parameter. In magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiment, the energy levels of the magnetic nucleus are split by the imposed magnetic field. Transitions between these energy levels are made to occur through the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the radio frequency range, typically the megahertz range. The absorption of the electromagnetic radiation gives rise to a &ldquo;resonance&rdquo; line at a frequency that is energetically equivalent to the energy separation between the magnetic energy levels for the nucleus under investigation. The sample is spun at an angle to the imposed magnetic field (the so-called magnetic angle) to average-out dipolar interactions that can broaden the resonance lines and complicate the spectrum. Because the electrons surrounding the nucleus contribute to the magnetic field experienced by the nucleus, the resonance frequency is dependent on the chemical environment. Thus, the resonance frequency &ldquo;shifts&rdquo;, depending on the chemical environment. These &ldquo;chemical shifts&rdquo; in the resonance frequency are recorded in &ldquo;parts per million&rdquo; (ppm) frequency units relative to the frequency of a reference compound with a known chemical environment and an arbitrarily assigned chemical shift of 0 ppm. The magnitude of the chemical shift is often used to deduce information on the chemical environment of the nucleus in the chemical compound being studied by MAS NMR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the case of quadrupolar 2 Al nuclei, the splitting of the nuclear energy levels is determined by the nuclear magnetic spin quantum number 1&equals;5/2. The observed MAS NMR spectrum is typically dominated by the (&plus;&frac12;, &minus;&frac12;) central transition. The experimentally observed chemical shift for the resonance line corresponding to this transition can be influenced by quadrupolar interactions of the nucleus with the electric field gradient at the nucleus. Generally speaking, the observed <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shifts are too small and should be corrected for quadrupolar interactions to obtain the true values of the chemical shifts. However, if the electric field gradient at the nucleus is small, then the error in the observed resonance position for the (&plus;&frac12;, &minus;&frac12;) transition also is small (about 1 ppm or so in error) and no correction in the observed chemical shift is needed, especially if the differences in the chemical shifts being compared are much larger than the error caused by quadrupolar effects. This is typically the case for the AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra in most zeolites and related aluminosilicates (see Lippmaa et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 108 1730 (1986)), as well as for the Al(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight> cations that are used as the chemical shift reference in <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al NMR spectroscopy. For this reason, the chemical shifts reported here and in the literature for aluminosilicate mesostructures are not corrected for quadrupolar effects. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In order to have a contrast example for our newly invented aluminosilicate mesoporous molecular sieves, we prepared a conventional (well-ordered ) hexagonal MCM-41 aluminosilicate molecular sieve in which the overall Si/Al molar ratio was 49/1. This Example 1 sample is denoted 2% Al-MCM-41. The synthesis recipe was as follows: a solution containing the appropriate amounts of sodium aluminate (NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and sodium silicate solution was mixed, and then the required amount of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>acid was added under stirring to obtain a clear solution. Next, the required amount of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide in water was added and the mixture was stirred vigorous at ambient temperature for 30 minutes.

The X-ray diffraction pattern exhibited three diffraction lines with d-spacings at 43.2, 24.9, and 21.6 &angst; and corresponding to the (100), (110) and (200) reflections, respectively, of a hexagonal mesostructure. The <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>AL-NMR spectrum for this particular sample is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In agreement with the findings reported by Corma and his coworkers, the MCM-41 aluminosilicate mesostructure prepared by this procedure has about &frac13; of the Al-sites in octahedral coordination and the remainder in tetrahedral coordination after calcination. The tetrahedral Al-sites exhibited a chemical shift at 53 ppm relative to 1.0 M aluminum nitrate solution, whereas the chemical shift for the aluminum in octahedral sites was 0 to 10 ppm. These chemical shifts are in agreement with the typical literature values (i.e. 53&tilde;56 ppm for tetrahedral aluminum and &tilde;0.0 ppm for octahedral aluminum for a conventional Al-MCM-41. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 TO 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> These two examples illustrate according to the teachings of the present invention the preparation of mesoporous aluminosilicates with hexagonal, cubic, and wormhole framework structures that are steam-stable in comparison to like mesostructure compositions obtained from conventional aluminosilicate precursors. The preferred aluminosilicate precursors of this invention contain nanosized aggregates in which the aluminum is in tetrahedral coordination and linked through bridging oxygen atoms to silicon tetrahedra that in are largely in Q<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>connectivity to other silicon tetrahedra. By Q<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>connectivity we mean that the SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedron is linked through bridging oxygens to four adjacent tetrahedra that are occupied by silicon and aluminum. These nanosized aluminosilicate precursors also are capable of promoting the crystallization of atomically ordered zeolite phases when mixed with suitable gels and aged under hydrothermal conditions. Owing to their ability to nucleate zeolitic phases, such as zeolites type Y (more precisely faujasitic zeolites) and ZSM-5 (more precisely MFI zeolites, these highly cross-linked precursors are often referred to as &ldquo;zeolite seeds&rdquo;. Therefore, the aluminosilicate precursor of Example 2 is referred to here as a &ldquo;type Y seeds&rdquo; composition, because it is known to promote the crystallization of Type Y zeolite. Likewise, the cross-linked aluminosilicate precursor of Example 3 is referred to here as &ldquo;ZSM-5 seeds&rdquo;, because the precursor is known to nucleate the crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolite. However, in this example we use these zeolite seeds as precursors to mesoporous molecular sieve aluminosilicates with atomically disordered (amorphous) walls, but with a hexagonal, cubic or wormhole pore structure that sufficiently order on a mesoscopic length scale to exhibit correlation (Bragg) peaks in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The type Y seeds composition of Example 2, which contained 10 mole % aluminum (Si/Al&equals;9/1), was prepared in the following manner. A NaOH aqueous solution with 0.088 mole NaOH and 8.5 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was prepared and 0.10 mole NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was added to this NaOH solution under stirring until a clear solution formed. To this basic sodium aluminate solution was added 1.0 mole of sodium silicate from a 27 wt % sodium silicate solution under vigorous stirring until a homogeneous opalescence gel formed. To obtain the Y-seeds composition, the gel was sequentially aged at ambient temperature over night and then at 100&deg; C. over night. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The 5% Al-ZSM-5-seeds composition corresponding to Example 3 was prepared from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as the silicon source and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as the template for ZSM-5 seed formation. TEOS (1.0 mole) was mixed with 0.22 mole of 1.0 M TPAOH to obtain a clear solution under mild heating. Then 0.05 mole aluminum sec-butoxide was added to obtain an opaque solution. The solution was diluted with 127 mole water and aged at 85&deg; C. for 3 days to produce a clear ZSM-5 seeds solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> 27Al-MAS NMR spectra of the above Type Y and ZSM-5 seeds compositions were recorded on a Varian VRX 400S instrument in a zirconia rotor at spinning speeds of 2 kHz and 900 Hz, respectively. The spectra are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> provides the X-ray diffraction pattern of the 10% Al-Y-seeds obtained by smearing the Y-seeds gel on a glass plate in the absence (bottom) or the presence of ethanol (top) to help promote the aggregation of the aluminosilicate precursor. The single <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al NMR lines with chemical shifts of 55 and 59 ppm correspond to aluminum in a zeolite-like tetrahedral environment. In other words, the aluminosilicate species in the precursor compositions exhibit an NMR pattern consistent with the presence of nano-sized aluminosilicate clusters, as reported in the literature (White et al, <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. </italic></highlight>1998, 94, 2181; van Santen et al, <highlight><italic>Chem. Mater. </italic></highlight>1999, 11, 36). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The following examples will illustrate the use of these nano-clustered zeolite seeds as precursors for the assembly of aluminosilicate mesostructures with hexagonal, cubic, and wormhole frameworks that are ultrastable under steaming conditions in comparison to mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves prepared from conventional precursor solutions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> These three examples were designed to illustrate the use of nanoclustered zeolite seeds according to art of the present invention for the preparation of mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves with long range hexagonal order even at high tetrahedral aluminum concentrations in the framework. The hexagonal order is retained even after the mesostructures have been calcined to remove the surfactant. These mesostructures also exhibited a <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>AL-NMR resonance with a chemical shift substantially greater than 56 ppm, indicating a more zeolitic connectivity of SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units in the framework walls. This minimum chemical shift value for our new aluminate mesostructures is larger than the previously reported literature values for all known aluminated derivatives of silica mesostructures, regardless of the long range structural order of the mesostructure or the method used to form the aluminated derivatives. Moreover, the aluminum NMR chemical shifts for our new aluminosilicate mesostructures are comparable to the values typically observed for the siting of aluminum centers of crystalline zeolites, including steam stable HY zeolite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates how the art of the present invention overcomes the destructive effect of direct aluminum incorporation that is normally encountered in the assembly of a mesoporous aluminosilicate with long range hexagonal order. The three mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves of examples 4, 5, and 6 have Al-loading of 2 mol %, 10 mol % and 20 mol %, and are denoted 2% Al-, 10% Al., And 20% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, respectively.

In this example, tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) in place of CTAB as the structure director. A reaction mixture containing 0.25 mole TTAB as the surfactant structure director and a 20 mol % Al type Y zeolite aluminosilicate precursor was prepared and processed in the same way as described in Examples 4 to 6.

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> These two examples were designed to demonstrate the art of the present invention for the preparation of our new aluminosilicate mesostructures with long range cubic order, which we denote as Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>. These cubic compositions also exhibit tetrahedral <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-NMR resonances at chemical shifts greater than 56 ppm and similar to the chemical shift of HY zeolite. Two cubic mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves with Al contents of 2 mol %, and 10 mol % were prepared corresponding to examples 8 and 9, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> To obtain the said cubic mesostructures, gel-like zeolite type Y aluminosilicate seed precursors with the appropriate Al content were obtained according to Example 2 and diluted with 127 mole water. For each mole of silicon used in the reaction mixture, the diluted gel was first treated with 0.044 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to lower the pH. Then 0.12 mole CTAB and 3.0 mole ethanol was sequentially added under vigorous stirring at ambient temperature. After being stirred for 40 minutes the pH of the reaction mixture was reduced with the addition of 0.14 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The resulting mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 150&deg; C. for 15 h. The as-made products were recovered by filtration, air-dried and then calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove the surfactant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the top diffraction pattern is for the calcined 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>sample prepared from type Y zeolite seeds as described in Example 9. The bottom diffraction pattern is for 2% Al-MCM-48 as a contrast sample (Example 10). This contrast sample was prepared from conventional precursors by mixing diluted sodium silicate (1.0 mole) and sodium aluminate (0.02 mole) and NaOH (0.088 mole) solutions to obtain a clear solution and then reducing the pH immediately with 0.18 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. Then, 0.12 mole CTAB and 3 mole ethanol per mole of silicon was sequentially added under vigorously stirring at ambient temperature before transferring the reaction mixture to a Teflon-lined autoclave to age at 150&deg; C. for 15 h. The product was then washed and calcined at 540&deg; C. to remove the surfactant. This same procedure afforded a well-ordered cubic MCM-48-like silica when the aluminum was omitted from the reaction mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> It is clear from the XRD pattern for the calcined 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>mesostructure in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> that a well ordered cubic mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves was obtained from type Y zeolite seeds as the inorganic precursor. In contrast, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also shows that the calcined 2% Al-MCM-48 mesostructure prepared from conventional sodium aluminate, sodium silicate precursors and surfactant is disordered as judged from the broad low angle x-ray reflections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-NMR spectra of 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>from Example 8 and 2% Al-MCM-48 from Example 10 are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The zeolite-like resonance at a chemical shift of 62 ppm clearly indicates the exclusive presence of tetrahedral Al-sites for the cubic 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>. An analogous result was obtained for the cubic 10%-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>mesostructure prepared in Example 9. However, the resonance for the tetrahedra aluminum in 2% Al-MCM-48 occurs at a chemical shift of 56 ppm. In addition, this latter mesostructure exhibits a resonance (indicated by the arrow) at 0 ppm corresponding to octahedral Al-sites. Consequently, we can conclude that pre-formation of aluminosilicate nanocluster indeed improves the long range order of cubic mesostructures as well as the Al-sitting in these mesoporous molecular sieves. The BET surface area (and pore volume) measured from N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>adsorption isotherms for the MSU-SC samples prepared from Example 8 and 9 were 976 (0.70) and 599 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g (0.51 cc/g).

The filling of the framework wormhole pores is indicated by the step in the adsorption isotherms at partial pressures between 0.25 and 0.45. In agreement with a wormhole framework structure, the X-ray diffraction patterns (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) for the calcined aluminosilicate mesoporous molecular sieves of examples 11 and 12 contain a single intense X-ray diffraction line corresponding to the correlation length between the wormhole pores and a weak higher order refectin at higher scattering angle. Also, the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-NMR spectra for these two wormhole mesostructures exhibited a zeolitic chemical shift at &tilde;61 ppm, in accord with the shifts observed for the samples prepared in Example 4 to 6. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 13 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The purpose for this example was to show that the aluminosilicate mesostructures prepared from nanoclustered zeolite seeds according to the present art are capable of surviving exposure to steam at 800&deg; C., at least when the structures are free of sodium ions and surfactant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Samples of 10% Al-MSU-S and 20% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, were prepared from nanoclustered zeolite Y type seeds according to the general procedure described in Examples 4-6. One-gram quantities of each as-made sample were separately treated with 100 ml 0.1 M NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>aqueous solution at 100&deg; C. for overnight. The treated samples were recovered by filtration and calcined at 540&deg; C. in air for 7 hours to remove the surfactant in the mesopores. These calcined samples were used for steam stability testing. Each sample was steamed at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours in the a stream of 20 vol % steam-containing N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Then the X-ray diffraction patterns and nitrogen adsorption isotherms were used to investigate the retention of a mesoporous structure after steaming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is obvious that the aluminosilicate mesostructures formed from preformed aluminosilicate nanoclusters retained their hexagonal structural integrity entirely, but the conventional MCM-41 like hexagonal mesostructure collapsed after steaming treatment at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours. This is in agreement with what has been reported previously by Ryoo and his co-workers (Ryoo, J. Phys. Chem. 1995, 99, 16742) regarding the stability of MCM-41 prepared from conventional precursors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Chemical analysis of the calcined samples before steaming indicated the presence of about 0.8% carbon. Samples calcined for periods longer or shorter periods than eight hours contained quantities of carbon lower than or greater than the 0.8 wt % value, respectively. Also, the degree to which the samples retained a hexagonal X-ray pattern and a framework mesoporosity after steaming generally paralleled the carbon content. Thus, we conclude that the framework embedded carbon, as well as the zeolite-like connectivity of the framework walls contributes to the steam stability of these materials. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 14 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The purpose of this example was to prepare a so-called ultrastable Al-MCM-41 sample according to the preparation art of R. Mokaya, as described in <highlight><italic>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. </italic></highlight>1999, 38 No.19, 2930. A 1.0 g calcined sample of a &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; MCM-41 silica was prepared according to the methodology of Mokaya (see below). To this secondary silica was add 50 ml of aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH) solution (0.48 M with respect to Al) and the mixture was stirred at 80&deg; C. for 2 h. The resulting solid was collected by filtration and washed with 100 ml distilled water until it was free of Cl<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> ions, dried at room temperature, and calcined in air at 550&deg; C. for 4 h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In accord with the teachings of Mokaya, in order to prepare a &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; MCM-41 silica, we first prepared a &ldquo;primary&rdquo; MCM-41 silica. To obtain the primary MCM-41 silica, 2.0 g of fumed silica was added to a solution containing 3.0 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 0.610 g tetramethyl-ammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) in 24 g H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O at 35&deg; C. under stirring for 1 h. After further stirring for 1 h, the resulting synthetic gel of molar composition 1.SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; 0.25 CTAB: 0.2TMAOH; 40H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was left to age 20 h at room temperature then the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150&deg; C. for 48 h. The solid product was obtained by filtration, washed with distilled water, dried in air at room temperature and calcined at 550&deg; C. for 8 h. The &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; MCM-41 silica was then prepared from the primary MCM-41 silica. To prepare the secondary MCM-41, a synthesis gel of same molar ratio was prepared, except that the primary calcined MCM-41 was used as silica source instead of fumed silica. The synthetic procedures were identical to the described for the primary synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The procedure for the steam stability test was as follows: 0.2 g of ultra stable MCM-41 was put into a Y-shaped quartz tube reactor and a stream of 20 vol % steam in N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was introduced at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours. The 20% water steam in N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was generated using a saturator. The X-ray diffraction patterns and N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-sorption and desorption isotherms were used to evaluate the residual structure after steaming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As shown by the X-ray and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>adsorption data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A, 11B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C, the ultrastable MCM-41 of Mokaya underwent structural collapsed after the steaming treatment at 800&deg; C. for 5 and the surface area was reduced by 92% to 62 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g by steaming. Also, the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR spectrum in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows that only about half the aluminum is in tetrahedral environments (&tilde;51 ppm) and the other half is in octahedral environments (&tilde;0 ppm). We conclude that this material lacks the desired stability for many practical applications in acid catalysis, especially catalytic cracking. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Example 15 describes the synthesis and properties of a typical hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructure., &excl;0% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>(Si:Al&equals;9:1), derived from seeds that normally nucleate the crystallization of faujasitic zeolite type Y. The procedure used here for forming the zeolite type Y seeds follows the general methodology described in the literature (Robson, H. ACS Symp. Ser. 398 436 (1989); and Lechert, L., et al., Stud. Surf. Sci. Catal. 84 147 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Example 16 describes the preparation of a 10% Al-MCM-41 from convention silicate and aluminate precursors by eliminating the zeolite seeds-forming step used in the preparation of the 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>in Example 15. We then compare on the basis of XRD and nitrogen adsorption properties the steam stabilities of these two mesostructures. In addition, we include in the comparison of steam stability the &ldquo;ultrastable&rdquo; Al-MCM-41 prepared as described in Example 14 using the method of Mokaya. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>of Example 15 was prepared as follows. First, 0.269 g NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was dissolved in a solution of 0.116 g of NaOH in 5.0 ml water to obtain a clear solution. To this solution was added 7.29 g of sodium silicate solution (27 wt % SiO2, 14 wt % NaOH) under vigorous stirring to obtain a homogeneous mixture. To generate faujasitic type Y zeolite seeds, the resulting mixture was aged at room temperature overnight and then an additional 24 hour period at 100&deg; C. under static conditions. The mixture of zeolite seeds was diluted with 75 ml of water to obtain a milky suspension. Concentrated sulfuric acid (0.142 g) was added to the seeds mixture, followed by the addition of 2.45 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) under vigorous stirring for 30 minutes. Then an additional 0.781 g of sulfuric acid was added and the mixture was allowed to age at 100&deg; C. under static conditions overnight. Following this aging step additional increments of 0.156 g and 0.781 g of sulfuric acid were added and the mixture was again allowed to age at 100&deg; C. overnight under static conditions to form the mesostructure. At this point the pH of the reaction mixture was about 9.0 The resulting 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>product prepared from zeolite seed precursors was filtered, washed, and dried at ambient temperature in air. A 1.0-g quantity of the air-dried product was treated with 100 ml of 1.0M NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>at 100&deg; C. overnight to displace sodium ions and about half of the surfactant from the mesopores, dried in air, and then calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove remaining surfactant and to convert charge-balancing ammonium ions to protons. Chemical analysis of the calcined product indicated a Si:Al molar ratio of 9:1, along with the presence of 0.80 wt % carbon. We attribute the formation of carbon to the cracking of surfactant in the very acidic mesopores of the zeolite-like framework of the hexagonal MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>mesostructure during calcination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The 10% Al-MCM-41 comparative sample of Example 16 was prepared as follows. A mixture of 0.269 g of NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 7.29 g of sodium silicate (27 wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 14 wt % NaOH) were stirred vigorously to form a homogeneous mixture and then 75 ml of water was added to form a milky suspension. To the milky suspension was added sequentially with stirring 0.142 g of concentrated sulfuric acid, 2.45 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide with vigorous stirring for 30 minutes , and 0.781 g concentrated sulfuric acid. The resulting mixture was allowed to age overnight at 100&deg; C. under static conditions. The resulting 10% Al-MCM-41 mesostructure prepared from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors was filtered, and dried in air at ambient temperature. A 1.0-g quantity of the air-dried product was treated with 100 ml of 1.0M NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>at 100&deg; C. overnight to displace sodium ions and some of the surfactant from the mesopores, dried in air, and then calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove remaining surfactant and to convert charge-balancing ammonium ions to protons. Chemical analysis indicated a Si/Al ratio of 9/1, but the presence of less than 0.04% carbon. </paragraph>

Included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference> are the corresponding patterns for 14% Al-MCM-41 prepared as described in Example 14 using the very recently reported post-synthesis grafting reaction between a sodium-free MCM-41 silica and Al<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>oligocations (R. Mokaya, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 38, 2930 (1999)). This latter grafted form of Al-MCM-41 has been described as being &ldquo;ultrastable&rdquo; in comparison to all previously reported Al-MCM-41 derivatives. The XRD patterns of calcined 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>and ultrastable 14% Al-MCM-41 prior to steaming show well expressed hkl diffraction lines indicative of a hexagonal mesostructure. The diffraction lines for 10% Al MCM-41, made by the direct synthesis route of Example 16, are substantially broadened. This broadening of the diffraction lines is indicative of the disorder that normally accompanies the direct assembly of Al-MCM-41 from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors, particularly when the intended level of silicon substitution by aluminum in the framework is greater than about 8 mole %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The XRD patterns in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> clearly indicate that the 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>mesostructure assembled from nanoclustered zeolite seeds retains a well ordered hexagonal structure upon steaming at 800&deg; C. In comparison, the Al-MCM-41 mesostructures prepared both by direct assembly from conventional silicate and aluminate precursors and by so called ultrastable grafting reaction are almost totally destroyed by steaming. These observations are supported by a comparison of the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sorption isotherms shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference> for the same series of mesostructures.

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>sample of Example 15 retains more than 90% of its surface area and about 75% of its framework pore volume after steaming. In addition, the steam treatment improves the textural porosity of the mesostructure as evidenced by the hysteresis behavior at partial pressures above 0.50. In contrast, little or no surface area or framework pore volume is retained after steaming for either of the two Al-MCM-41 samples prepared according to Examples 14 and 16. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The unique hydrothermal stability of Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>is attributed at least in part to the retention of a zeolite-like connectivity of AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra upon assembling the zeolite seeds into a mesostructure. Also, the occluded carbon plays a role in contributing to the structural stability, because samples that are calcined for longer times at 541&deg; C. or at higher temperatures to remove more carbon exhibited a somewhat larger loss in surface area and pore volume upon steaming. However, in support of the importance of a zeolite-like connectivity of SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units in the framework walls, the Al chemical shift of tetrahedral aluminum in as-made and calcined Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>occurs at 5&equals;60 ppm, the same value as the seeds solution and within the 59-65 ppm range observed for most zeolites (Lippma, E., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108 1730 (1986)). This chemical shift value is unique among aluminosilicate mesostructures. All previously reported mesostructured aluminosilicates, including the Al-MCM-41 samples of the present work, exhibit a chemical shift of 53-56 ppm. On the basis of the relationship between <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al chemical shift and the mean bond angle in framework aluminosilicates provided by Lippma et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 108, 1730 (1986)), the mean Al&mdash;O&mdash;Si angle is substantially smaller (by &minus;8 degrees) for the 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>of Example 15 than for the two Al-MCM-41 prepared as described in Examples 14 and 16. </paragraph>

In contrast to the Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>compositions reported in Examples 4, 5, and 6, where the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shifts are well within the zeolitic range of 57-65 ppm, the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR shift observed for the product of this example was equivalent to the shift found for the initial ZSM-5 seed precursor and comparable to the shifts typically found for aluminosilicate mesostructures assemble from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors (53-56 ppm). However, the resulting mesostructure showed an infrared absorption band indicative of the presence of ZSM-5 type secondary building blocks in the framework walls. The presence of a stable, zeolite-like framework wall structure for the product of this example was verified by a hydrothermal stability to both steam and boiling water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Tetraethylorthosilicate (6.83 g) was added with stirring to 7.22 ml of 1.0 M tetrapropylammonium hydroxide and then 0.17 g of aluminum sec-butoxide was added to form a clear solution. A 75 ml portion of water was added to the stirred solution, and the solution was allowed to age at 85&deg; C. overnight under static conditions to form a clear solution of ZSM-5 zeolite seeds. A 2.45-g portion of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide then was added under vigorous stirring for 30 minutes, and the resulting mixture was allowed to age at 100&deg; C. under static conditions overnight. The pH of the reaction mixture was lowered to a value of 9.0 by the addition of 1.0 M sulfuric acid and the reaction mixture was aged again overnight at 100&deg; C. under static conditions. The mesostructured precipitate was filtered, washed, dried in air and then calcined at 550&deg; C. to remove the surfactant. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the calcined 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>product exhibited four diffraction lines (100, 110, 200, 210) consistent with a hexagonal mesostructure. The <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR spectrum of the calcined product exhibited a single resonance line at 55 ppm, consistent with the same linked AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedral environment as in ZSM-5 seeds (see the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR spectrum for ZSM-5 seeds in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Further evidence for a zeolite-like framework wall structure was obtained from the infrared absorption spectrum of the calcined 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>mesostructure.

<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Kloetstra et al (Chem.

This material was prepared by exchanging a conventional Al-MCM-41 with tetrapropylammonium ions and subsequently heating the exchanged mesostructure in glycerol to convert some of the framework into embryonal ZSM-5 units. However, we find upon repeating this work that the mesostructure of Kloetstra et al is hydrothermally unstable. Boiling the material in water for 5 hours or exposing it to 20% steam in nitrogen stream at 600&deg; C. for 5 hours results in nearly the complete loss of framework mesoporosity. In contrast, the hexagonal 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>of Example 18 retains nearly all of its framework mesoporosity under these conditions, Thus, the introduction of ZSM-5 type building blocks into the framework walls of MCM-41 by the method of Kloetstra appears to be localized to specific regions of the framework adjacent to tetrapropylammonium cations, whereas the use of zeolite seeds as precursors according to example 18 affords a more uniform framework of zeolite-like connectivity and, hence, greatly improved hydrothermal stability. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates that preparation of zeolite seeds for the assembly of hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructures is not limited to the use of sodium silicate precursor solutions containing 27 wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 14 wt % NaOH. Sodium silicate solutions containing higher ratios of silica to sodium hydroxide are also suitable for forming the zeolite seeds needed for the supramolecular assembly of hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Example 19 illustrates the use of a sodium silicate solution containing 28.43 wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 8.93 wt % NaOH for preparing zeolite type Y zeolite nucleating centers (seeds) and the subsequent use of these zeolite seeds for preparing an aluminosilicate mesostructure with a zeolite-like <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift in the range 57 to 65 ppm. The method used to prepare the seeds follows the general procedure provided by Vaughan (U.S. Pat. No. 4,178,352) for a zeolite Y seeds composition containing 35 mole % aluminum (Si/Al&equals;1.88). A NaOH aqueous solution containing 1.013 mole NaOH and 7.6 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was prepared and 0.54 mole NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was added to this NaOH solution under stirring until a clear solution formed. To this basic sodium aluminate solution was added 1.0 mole of sodium silicate (28.43% SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 8.93 wt % NaOH, 41 degree, Be&prime;,) in 6.6 mol H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O under vigorous stirring. The product set to a stiff gel within 2 minutes after mixing was completed. The above gel was called type Y zeolite seeds or nucleation centers. In order to form a mesoporous aluminosilicate the above zeolite Y seeds, 127 mol H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was added to the diluted mixture. To the diluted mixture was added sequentially 0.5065 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and 0.20 mole CTAB under stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes. The resultant mixture was further acidified with 0.15 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and aged at 100&deg; C. for 20 h. The mixture then was acidified with 0.029 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>under vigorous stirring and aged at 100&deg; C. again for 20 h to obtain the as-made aluminosilicate mesostructure. The as-made mesostructure were washed thoroughly with water and dried in air. The product was calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove the surfactant. The calcined product exhibited a single XRD line consistent with a wormhole framework structure and denoted 35% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. The corresponding basal spacing was about 5.0 nm. The chemical shift for the calcined product was 59 ppm, within the 57-65 ppm range expected for a hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructure assembled from zeolite seeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The sodium aluminate is prepared by reacting sodium hydroxide with an aluminum source selected from the group consisting of a soluble aluminum salt, a cationic aluminum oligomers, an aluminum hydroxide, an aluminum oxide, an aluminum alkoxide and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a unique class of chiral compounds for liquid crystals, and to liquid-crystalline mixtures containing such chiral compounds, and to their use for cholesteric displays and the resulting devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Cholesteric flat-panel displays are currently under development because of their low power consumption, bright viewing characteristics at wide angles, and high-resolution capability at low cost. Their low-power consumption is a result of the bistable memory characteristic inherent in the technology. As described in the first U.S. Patents on this technology (See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,251,048, 5,384,067, 5,437,811, and 5,453,863), each pixel of the display can exist in a stable color reflective state with any desired reflective intensity or brightness (gray-scale) without any applied power. The degree of brightness is electronically selected by a pulse. A unique feature described in those inventions, is the existence of a threshold in the electronic response to a pulse such that a matrix of pixels can be multiplexed to achieve a high resolution display at low cost without the need of transistor elements (active matrix) at each pixel. Because of the low power and reflective brightness characteristics, cholesteric displays are used in portable or handheld applications where long battery life and versatile viewing capabilities are important. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The reflective properties of cholesteric liquid crystals have been generally known for many years. Sometimes called a chiral nematic, a cholesteric liquid crystal achieves its color reflective property because the molecules are arranged in a helical twist pattern with a periodicity (pitch length) equal to the wavelength of light in the material. The first materials explored with this property were the cholesterol esters. These materials are not only chiral but also liquid crystalline and reflect iridescent colors when the periodicity of the twist corresponds to a reflective wavelength from 400 nm to about 700 nm &lsqb;&ldquo;Cholesteric Structure&mdash;II: Chemical Significance&rdquo;, p105-119, J. L. Fergason, N. N. Goldberg, R. J. Nadalin, <highlight><italic>Liquid Crystals, </italic></highlight>Ed. G. H. Brown, G. J. Dienes, M. M. Labes, Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, New York (1966)&rsqb;. The materials were therefore called cholesteric liquid crystals, a name still used today even though cholesterol materials are seldom used today. Instead, a mixture of chiral and achiral compounds is used as discussed by Gottarelli et al. &lsqb;&ldquo;Induced Cholesteric Mesophases: Origin and Application, G. Gottarelli, G. P. Spada, Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst., 123, 377-388 (1985)&rsqb;. Achiral liquid crystalline compounds make up a nematic liquid crystalline host mixture, which has no helical twist by itself. To this host nematic is added a chiral compound to twist up the nematic material into one of a cholesteric structure, hence the name chiral nematic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The helical arrangement of the molecules provides a self-assembled stack of dielectric layers because of the anisotropy of the refractive index of the molecules. The index of refraction continuously varies along the stack by as much as 0.25 depending upon the nematic material. Because of the helical nature of the refractive index in the layer, the stack will reflect one circular component of a selected bandwidth of colored light. A right handed twisted planar texture will therefore decompose incident unpolarized white light into its right and left components by reflecting the right hand component and transmitting the left. A left-handed twisted material will do the opposite. A left-hand display cell stacked on top of a right-hand cell, both with the same pitch length, will reflect all of the incident light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to Bragg&apos;s law, the wavelength &lgr;, of the selective reflection is given by the equation: &lgr;&equals;np where p is the pitch of the helical structure and n is the average refractive index of the liquid crystal mixture. In mixtures of a nematic liquid crystal with the chiral additive, the reciprocal of the pitch length is approximately proportional to the concentration X, of the chiral compound, p<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>&equals;&bgr;<highlight><subscript>X </subscript></highlight>with &bgr; being the helical twisting power (HTP). Conventional chiral additives available today have twisting powers typically of &bgr;&lt;15 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>when X is measured in weight percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Certain dimethanoldioxolane derivatives have been described in the literature as possessing large HTP values. E.g., &ldquo;TADDOLs with Unprecedented Helical Twisting Power in Liquid Crystals&rdquo;, H. G. Kuball, B. Weiss, A. K. Beck, D. Seebach, <highlight><italic>Helvetica Chimica Acta, </italic></highlight>80, 2507-2514 (1997); &ldquo;TADDOLs Under Closer Scrutiny&mdash;Why Bulky Substituents Make it All Different&rdquo;, A. K. Beck, M. Dobbler, D. A. Plattner, <highlight><italic>Helvetica Chimica Acta, </italic></highlight>80, 2073-2083 (1997); and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,255. Like other chiral additives, they are also known to generally possess large temperature dependent values of dp/dT and, hence, d&lgr;/dT. Their temperature dependencies tend to be positive in that the pitch length increases with w increasing temperature, causing a cholesteric material to change from blue to red reflecting. Furthermore, the temperature dependence dp/dT has been shown to depend on the material of the host nematic. See &ldquo;TADDOLs with Unprecedented Helical Twisting Power in Liquid Crystals&rdquo;, H. G. Kuball, B. Weiss, A. K. Beck, D. Seebach, <highlight><italic>Helvetica Chimica Acta, </italic></highlight>80, 2507-2514 (1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order for flat-panel displays to be useful for portable applications, it is necessary for the display be operable over a wide range of temperatures. Outdoor temperatures can range from &minus;20&deg; C. to &plus;50&deg; C. depending on the environment. It would be advantageous if the reflected colors did not change over this temperature range. Implementing this desirable characteristic is not a straightforward task, since nearly all cholesteric liquid crystalline materials are well known to exhibit reflective colors that vary strongly with changes in temperature. Depending on the shape or chemical structure of the chiral molecule, the pitch length p and, hence, the peak reflective wavelength &lgr;, can increase with temperature (&plus;d&lgr;)/dT) or decrease with temperature (&minus;d&lgr;/dT). Also, in many cases, d&lgr;/dT is not linear over the temperature range of the cholesteric phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It should be mentioned at this point that the measurement for the temperature dependence of the pitch is performed using test cells, each of which is 5 &mgr;m thick, and has a hard coat layer on both substrates. There is also an unrubbed polyimide surface on top of the hard coat layers. The measurement for the temperature dependence of the pitch is performed in the following manner. A collimated light is incident on the display at surface normal and the reflected light is detected at 45&deg;. The display is scanned in the wavelength band that includes the peak-reflected wavelength, e.g., 400 nm to 700 nm, or 700 nm to 1500 nm. The cell is switched to the planar texture at each test temperature. The measurement is performed from &minus;20&deg; C. to &plus;70&deg; C. in 10&deg; C. intervals. It should be noted that, for the purposes of a flat temperature dependence, only a portion of the test temperature range, i.e., temperatures between &plus;10&deg; C. to &plus;50&deg; C., are considered. In any event, the maximum change in peak reflected wavelength is then recorded. A mixture is considered to exhibit temperature independent color behavior if the maximum change in the peak reflection wavelength is 30 nm or less across the temperature range of &plus;10&deg; C. to &plus;50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It has been shown that cholesteric displays fabricated using a mixture of two or more chiral compounds as additives can be made to produce a helical twist power and, hence, reflective wavelength that is independent of temperature by combining a chiral compound that has a &plus;d&lgr;/dT with one with a &minus;d&lgr;/dT. U.S. Pat. No. 5,309,265 describes a means of achieving a temperature independent &lgr; by combining a plurality of chiral compounds, where both compounds exhibit the same twist sense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that there are a number of factors that preclude employing many previously known chiral compounds in liquid crystals. First of all, a chiral compound must be soluble in the nematic liquid crystal host material; many compounds are simply not soluble or only weakly soluble and, thus, cannot be used. In compounds that are soluble, they may adversely affect the nematic material by substantially reducing the temperature range of the liquid crystalline phase. If the chiral compound has an HTP that is too low, it may be necessary to add a large quantity of the additive which can dilute some of the desirable physical properties of the host nematic needed for the cholesteric display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Consequently, a need still exists for a chiral additive, which is readily soluble in a nematic host mixture and which can be used individually (i.e., without needing to be combined with other chiral materials) for cholesteric displays that provides a high helical twisting power, substantially independent of temperature in operating ranges suitable for the cholesteric displays. What is also needed is a cholesteric display exhibiting a high helical twisting power, which is substantially independent of temperature in operating ranges suitable for the cholesteric displays, which display includes at least one chiral additive, which is readily soluble in a nematic host mixture. In some cases it would be desirable if the temperature dependence of the cholesteric display could be tailored by the addition of a second additive, e.g., either an achiral compound or a second chiral additive different from the first chiral additive, where the twist senses of the first and second chiral additives are opposite to one another. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In this invention, a new class of derivatives of dioxolanes embodied by the formula of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has been discovered that provide a substantially temperature independent dp/dT over a wide operating temperature range when added to nematic liquid crystalline mixtures with physical properties that are useful in cholesteric displays, including commercially viable cholesteric displays. The inventive chiral compounds are especially useful as additives to nematic liquid crystals for use in cholesteric displays to achieve needed properties for their practical use, particularly in portable device applications. Significantly, this invention provides this utility while only requiring the use of a single type of chiral additive compound within the scope of the invention, as described herein, and without requiring a mixture of different types of chiral additives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Commercially viable displays require a liquid crystal mixture that has a dielectric anisotropy, birefringence and desired elastic and viscosity coefficients to provide a display with suitable brightness, contrast, and speed. The dielectric anisotropy and viscosity must be such that low voltage pulses can be used to reduce the cost of the electronic drive chips as well as implement drive schemes and waveforms for rapidly addressing the display. The birefringence has to be large to provide high brightness. Furthermore, the materials must not provide undesirable features to the display such as image sticking or phase separation. Cholesteric displays therefore require very special cholesteric materials. Cholesteric displays incorporating the inventive dioxolane derivatives satisfactorily meet all these criteria and requirements, while providing superior temperature independence performance and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Namely, the invention provides chiral compound additives to nematic liquid crystals that provide at least the following features important for cholesteric displays: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 1. Solubility in nematic liquid crystals that have the physical properties necessary for cholesteric displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 2. Possess a helical twist power (HTP) generally ranging from 15 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to 200 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, and more usually from 30 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to 90 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. HTP values in this range are not so small as to dilute the important physical properties of nematic liquid crystals when twisted to reflect light in the visible spectrum. In addition, these values are not so large that slight inhomogeneities in the mixture caused by phase separation can disfigure the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> 3. Provide a substantially temperature independent HTP in the cholesteric phase over the operating temperature range of cholesteric displays of commercial value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 4. Do not decompose under ultraviolet light of exposures under common environmental conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 5. Do not chemically react with the host nematic liquid crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> 6. Possess the property that the temperature dependence can be modified by the addition of an achiral additive to the nematic liquid crystal. Such an additive may or may not posses a liquid crystalline phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As compared to the competing contemporarily available chiral additives that have twisting powers typically of &bgr;&lt;15 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>when X is measured in weight percent, the new soluble chiral additive materials, invented here, have values of &bgr; approaching 80 &mgr;m<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. This is a substantial improvement since the concentration of the chiral additive in this invention can be so small as to have a near negligible effect on the physical properties of the nematic liquid crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Chiral nematic liquid crystalline materials within the scope of this invention, which include an inventive chiral additive and a nematic host mixture, can be implemented in cholesteric liquid crystal displays, electro-optical cells, and light modulating apparatuses in manners, arrangements and/or systems consistent with the descriptions, such as set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,251,048, 5,384,067, 5,437,811, and 5,453,863, whose descriptions are incorporated by reference. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that E44 is commercially available nematic liquid crystal mixture that was obtained from Merck KgaA in Darmstadt, Germany through EM Industries in Hawthorne, N.Y. It will also be noted that the percentage of compound (4), and thus the percentage of E44, advantageously can be varied to achieve the desired reflective wavelength. For example, varying the percentage of compound (4) from 10 wt % to 2 wt % changes the reflective wavelength from the visible into the infrared. Finally, it will be noted that other additive materials can be included in the cell material to improve other cell properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As to the cholesteric display test cell arrangement used, both mixtures, i.e., Compositions 1 and 2, were vacuum filled in separate surface stabilized cholesteric displays with a 5 &mgr;m cell spacing. To accomplish this, two glass plate substrates were put together using an epoxy material around the perimeters with the substrates separated by 5 micron spacers and a small hole left in the perimeter seal for introducing the liquid crystal. The inner faces of the glass substrates were coated with indium-tin oxide (ITO), a standard insulating layer, and a polyimide layer for liquid crystal alignment. The back plate was painted black. The liquid crystal mixture was vacuum filled into the provided cell so that each liquid crystal mixture was sandwiched between the two glass plate substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The arrangement used to control the temperature of the liquid crystal mixtures samples being tested was as follows. A liquid nitrogen cryostat was used to control temperature on the test cells. The cryostat had a cold finger and a heater. The cryostat system fin was obtained from Janis Cryogenics. A white light source was used with a monochromator, both obtained from Oriel. A silicon detector was used to detect the light intensity. To measure the color, the cell was switched to the reflecting planar state at each temperature and the peak reflection wavelength was determined. The peak reflection wavelength of the cells was measured with incident light at the surface normal and reflected light detected at 45&deg;. The switching pulse used had a magnitude (amplitude and width) high enough to transform the texture to the reflecting planar texture at each temperature. The pulse was an AC square pulse. Data points were typically acquired every 10&deg; C. from &minus;20&deg; C. to about &plus;70&deg; C. The results of these measurements are plotted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In addition to the use of a single chiral additive, independence of the helical twisting power with temperature advantageously can be obtained by mixing two dioxolane materials that are structurally different and that exhibit opposite twist senses. </paragraph>

R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;C<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>23</subscript></highlight>&mdash; for UCN itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Thus, a further discovery of this invention is that fine-tuning can therefore be performed using certain achiral non-liquid crystalline compounds added to a cholesteric system with a nematic host mixture and a single chiral compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> For practicing this further embodiment, the achiral additive, namely, aliphatic nitrites, can be commercially obtained from Aldrich Chemicals or prepared by conventionally known methods. Useful alkyl nitrites as the achiral additive include 5C-17C alkanenitriles, and more preferably 8C-14C straight chain or n-alkane nitrites. One preferred alkyl nitrile is undecanenitrile, using IUPAC nomenclature (alternatively, referred to as undecyl cyanide, in common nomenclature). These achiral additives have been found to be effective in amounts of approximately 2 to 6 wt % of the overall liquid-crystalline mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Although E44 was exemplified above, virtually any nematic host mixture, including cyanobiphenyls known in the art, can be used in the practice of this invention. The inventive chiral compounds are readily soluble, as required, in many commercially available nematic host mixtures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described in terms of its preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Bacterial identification methods currently used include analysis of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic data. In the last two decades, molecular methods, especially 16S rRNA gene sequencing, have developed into reliable aids for the identification of diverse bacteria. Although the 16S rRNA method has served as a powerful tool for finding phylogenetic relationship between bacteria because of its molecular clock properties and the large database for sequence comparison, the molecule is too conserved to provide good resolution at the species and subspecies levels (See e.g., Woese, Microbiol. Rev., 51:221-271 &lsqb;1987&rsqb;; DeParasis and Roth, Phytopathol., 80:618-621 &lsqb;1990&rsqb;; Fox et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 42:166-170; Martinez-Murcia et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 42:412-421 &lsqb;1992&rsqb;; Stackebrandt and Goebel, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 44:846-849 &lsqb;1994&rsqb; and Weisburg et al., J. Bacteriol., 173:697-703 &lsqb;1991&rsqb;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The relationship between 16S rRNA gene similarity and percent DNA-DNA reassociation is a logarithmic function in which the sequence similarity within a species (&gt;70% DNA relatedness) is expected to be &gt;98% (Devereux et al., J. Bacteriol., 172:3609-3619 &lsqb;1990&rsqb;), and the similarity among different species in a genus (e.g., fluorescent Pseudomonas) is 93.3 to 99.9% (Moore et al., Syst. Appl. Microbiol., 19:478-492 &lsqb;1996&rsqb;). Considering the high sequence conservation and relative standard errors at 98% and 90% sequence similarities of 19% and 8%, respectively (Keswani et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 46:727-735 &lsqb;1996&rsqb;), 16S rDNA analysis results on closely related strains may be inaccurate and inconsistent with the results obtained by other methods. Incongruity between genome structure and 16S rDNA sequence similarity has also been reported (See, Lessie et al., FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 144:117-128 &lsqb;1996&rsqb;). As many important ecological and clinical characteristics of bacteria such as pathogenicity, competitiveness, substrate range, and bioactive molecule production, tend to vary below the species level, methods with higher resolution than 16S rDNA sequence are needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> DNA-DNA hybridization methods provide more resolution than 16S rDNA sequencing, and the 70% criterion (Wayne et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 37:463-464 &lsqb;1987&rsqb;) has been a cornerstone for describing a bacterial species. Nonetheless, these methods are not popular, largely due to major disadvantages such as the laborious nature of pairwise cross-hybridizations, the requirement for isotope use, and the fact that it is impossible to establish a central database using these methods. Thus, there remains a need for easy-to-use methods to identify and type microorganisms based on DNA-DNA homologies that eliminate these disadvantages. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides methods and compositions for the identification of microbial species from a variety of sources, including clinical specimens, food, environmental samples, waste or drinking water samples and industrial samples. In particularly preferred embodiments, the present invention provides a DNA &ldquo;chip&rdquo; containing bacterial genomic sequences arranged in a microarray for bacterial identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Indeed, the present invention provides a new approach to identify and type bacteria based on genomic DNA-DNA similarity that eliminates the disadvantages of prior art methods. As discussed in greater detail below, in preferred embodiments, the methods provided by the present invention take advantage of the capacity provided by microarray technology. Also as discussed in greater detail below, in these preferred embodiments, bacterial genomes are fragmented randomly and representative fragments are spotted on a glass slide and then hybridized to test genomes. Resulting hybridization profiles are used in statistical procedures to identify test strains. Importantly, a database of hybridization profiles is established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In some preferred embodiments, reference sequences are prepared by random cloning of genomic sequences in the 1 to 2 kb range from multiple reference species (strains) and subsequent amplification of the genomic inserts. The purified amplification products are then arrayed by a printing process. Genomic DNA from test strains (i.e., organisms to be characterized) is labeled by random priming, and co-hybridized to the chip with reference DNA, which is a mixture of genomic DNAs from the multiple reference species (strains). The hybridized chips are then laser scanned, and a hybridization ratio (test DNA/reference DNA) for each spot on the array is determined, with a correction made for labeling efficiency. Analysis of the corrected hybridization ratios is performed using a correlation coefficient, which can then be expressed as a similarity coefficient to compare hybridization profiles. Clustering analysis is also used to identify the test strains based on hybridization profiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one particular embodiment, the present invention provides a chip arrayed with genomic fragments from reference genomes of four fluorescent Pseudomonas strains. In one embodiment, 60 to 96 genome fragments of approximately 1 kb from each species were spotted on microarrays. Genomes from 12 well-characterized fluorescent Pseudomonas strains were labeled with Cy dyes and hybridized to the arrays. High reproducibility in repeated experiments was observed, and the similarity coefficients calculated based on hybridization to the chip agreed well with DNA-DNA homology-based relationships as determined by % DNA-DNA reassociation values in other reports. Cluster analysis grouped the test strains in agreement with other types of experimental data (16S rDNA sequence and % DNA-DNA homology). Many species were clearly resolved in the cluster analysis, while some pairs were not resolved. In addition to identification, the analysis was able to characterize the degree of conservation of the sequences on the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In addition to these embodiments utilizing Pseudomonas species, other embodiments of the present invention provide larger arrays, such as mixture of DNA from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. The present invention also provides methods to create databases of hybridization profiles for comparisons with future test strains. Also, in one embodiment, arrays containing up to approximately 100,000 DNA spots are used. Thus, a single array is capable of providing broad resolution and identification capacity. Furthermore, the present invention overcomes disadvantages associated with traditional DNA-DNA hybridization methods commonly used. For example, laborious cross-hybridizations are avoided and an open database (i.e., a reference database to match chip contents) of hybridization profiles is made possible by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, genome fragments from additional reference strains are spotted on the array, as this tends to increase the resolution and the consistency of the approach used in the present invention. In the Examples herein, the use of 338 genome fragments from four reference strains are described. Considering that the average genome size of fluorescent Pseudomonas strains is approximately 5 Mb and that the size of the genome fragments used was 1 to 2 Kb, the array used in these Examples sampled approximately 1 to 3% of a genome. However, assuming that each spot (i.e., genome fragment) tests individual genetic characteristics quantitatively, the array performed 338 individual tests for determining the similarity coefficients per one test strain. Sokal and Sneath (Sokal and Sneath, <highlight><italic>Principles of Numerical Taxonomy, </italic></highlight>W. H. Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco &lsqb;1963&rsqb;) suggest that use of more than 60 characters gives significant reliability for similarity coefficients and enough information for numerical taxonomy. In fact, all of similarity coefficients obtained as described in the Examples were statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Cluster analysis was also performed on the hybridization patterns of all 338 spotted fragments across all strain tested. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, four main clusters were found at a cophenetic similarity of 70%. Main clusters F, C, A, and P were mainly comprised of the fragments from the four reference strains, <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>(98.7%), <highlight><italic>P. chlororaphis </italic></highlight>(94.1%), <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>(91.8%), and <highlight><italic>P. putida </italic></highlight>(100%), respectively. Minor clusters V, W, X, and Z were comprised of the genome fragments from different reference strains. In gene expression data analysis, such clusters indicate that these genes tend to turn on and turn off simultaneously, but the grouping in this study indicates only that the hybridization patterns of the cluster member are similar at a certain degree. Formation of a cluster of genome fragments from different reference strains suggests, but does not confirm, conserved sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To conveniently find conserved and unique (variable) sequences in the fragment collection described in the Examples, an evenness index (E) (Legendre and Legendre, <highlight><italic>Numerical Ecology, </italic></highlight>Elsevier Science, Amsterdam &lsqb;1998&rsqb;; Pielou, J. Theor. Biol., 13:131-144 &lsqb;1966&rsqb;) was calculated from hybridization signal ratio profiles of each spotted genome fragment across the test strains. These results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. For fragments that are extremely conserved in all test strains (e.g., rRNA genes), the angle (&thgr;<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>) shows its minimum value (0&deg;). Genomic fragments showing a small angle (high evenness) tend to show a high hybridization signal ratio with low standard deviation, indicating that they have an equally high hybridization signal to many genomes tested. Hence, they can be considered to be conserved sequences. In contrast, genomic fragments with a large angle (low evenness) tend to show a low average signal ratio with high standard deviation, indicating that they have an appreciable hybridization signal only to the closely related strains. Hence, these are considered to be variable sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The average angle (&thgr;<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>) for all data was 35.0&deg;&plusmn;12.5&deg;. Fifty one (15.1%) fragments of &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values lower than one standard deviation (S.D.) below the mean (&lt;22.5&deg;) (See, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, Panel B) showed appreciable hybridization signal (R&prime;&gt;1) for the genomic DNAs from closely related species (e.g., species pairs <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. marginalis; </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. chlororaphis </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. aureofaciens</italic></highlight>). The majority of these originated from two reference strains <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>(ATCC 13525<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>) and <highlight><italic>P. chlororaphis </italic></highlight>(ATCC 9447), including only five fragments from the clusters V, W, X, and Z, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Fragments showing appreciable hybridization (R&prime;&gt;1) for all strains tested (e.g., &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>&lt;&lt;10&deg;), were not found on the array obtained as described in the present Examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Sixty eight (20.1%) fragments with &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values one S.D. above the mean (&gt;47.5&deg;) showed appreciable hybridization only when hybridized to the reference strains. The rest of the fragments (64.8%) showed an intermediate level of conservation. While four main clusters (F, P, C, and A; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) contain all genome fragments with &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values of 22.5&deg; to 47.5&deg; (at the species level), the groups of highly variable sequences (&thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>value&gt;47.5&deg;) (at the strain level) are also located in the main clusters (See, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). It is noteworthy that the variable and conserved sequences cannot be reliably identified by cluster analysis (See, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), but are easily revealed by &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The calculated &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values are also useful for constructing relationships between &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values and taxonomic distance (See, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), where valley-shaped regions are considered to be caused by selection pressure, resulting in subsequent speciation events. The genome fragments with low &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values have almost identical sequences, and are distributed over a wide taxonomic range, while the fragments with high &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values are distributed over a narrow taxonomic range. When the empirical results obtained in the Examples described herein (i.e., &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values) were applied to this diagram, the degree of conservation within strain level, species level, closely related species level, and genus level roughly corresponded to &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values of &gt;50&deg;, 50&deg; to 20&deg;, 20&deg; to 10&deg;, and &lt;10&deg;, respectively. Additionally, a taxonomic distance (D<highlight><subscript>1/tan(&thgr;)</subscript></highlight>) was calculated (D<highlight><subscript>1/tan(&thgr;)</subscript></highlight>&equals;1/&lsqb;tan(&thgr;<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>)&rsqb;). The range of &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>values for species level (&gt;20&deg;) in the experiments described in the Examples resulted in a D<highlight><subscript>1/tan(&thgr;) </subscript></highlight>of 2.74, indicating a radius of taxonomic range for a species. This alternative to calculating taxonomic distance using genome-wide analyses finds use in delineating species, although the values would be expected to vary with the microbial group tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention provides methods and compositions for the identification of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) using DNA-DNA hybridization with DNA microarrays. Although the present Examples involved testing on four reference strains of fluorescent Pseudomonas, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to this genus. Indeed, the methods of the present invention are suitable for use with various microorganisms. Given the current technology of microarray fabrication, it is possible to spot 100,000 genomic fragments on a chip. Hence, it is feasible to test 1000 reference strains with 100 genome fragments from each reference strain. Although arrays of this size are sufficient to cover the full taxonomic range of either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria, smaller or larger arrays are provided by the present invention. In addition, combinations of arrays find use in the extended analysis and comparisons of organisms. The methods of the present invention find use in determining the genetic distances among microorganisms, as well as for identifying species of microorganisms. In particularly preferred embodiments, the methods are used for the analysis of bacteria. However, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to bacteria, as the present invention finds use with other microorganisms as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides major improvements and advantages over the traditional DNA-DNA reassociation approaches commonly used. For example, the present invention does not need cross hybridization to identify genetic relationships between test strains, does not require the use of an isotope, and is capable of utilizing an open database of hybridization profiles when standard genome chips for bacteria are available. Indeed, unlike other methods presently available, the present invention permits the capture of hybridization information from any microbial species. The use of multiple probes and multiple reference species, that can be customized for the user&apos;s purposes, as needed, provides means for great capability in identification and characterization of microorganisms. For example, although the prototype described herein utilized only approximately 380 genome fragments from four different Pseudomonas species as reference strains, in other embodiments, the arrays of the present invention are constructed with probes from at least 5000 different species. Thus, using the method of the present invention, only 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>probes are needed to cover the majority of bacterial species. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;genotype&rdquo; refers to the entire genetic constitution of an organism, while the term &ldquo;phenotype&rdquo; refers to the entire physical, biochemical, and physiological makeup of an organism (e.g., the readily observable characteristics), as determined both genetically and by the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;sample&rdquo; and &ldquo;specimen&rdquo; in the present specification and claims are used in their broadest sense. On the one hand, they are meant to include a specimen or culture. On the other hand, they are meant to include both biological and environmental samples. These terms encompasses all types of samples obtained from humans and other animals, including but not limited to, body fluids such as urine, blood, fecal matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), semen, and saliva, as well as solid tissue. These terms also refers to swabs and other sampling devices which are commonly used to obtain samples for culture of microorganisms. </paragraph>

By &ldquo;enrichment means&rdquo; or &ldquo;enrichment treatment,&rdquo; the present invention contemplates (i) conventional techniques for isolating a particular microorganism of interest away from other microorganisms by means of liquid, solid, semi-solid or any other culture medium and/or technique, and (ii) novel techniques for isolating particular microorganisms away from other microorganisms. It is not intended that the present invention be limited only to one enrichment step or type of enrichment means. For example, it is within the scope of the present invention, following subjecting a sample to a conventional enrichment means, to subject the resultant preparation to further purification such that a pure culture of a strain of a species of interest is produced. This pure culture may then be analyzed by the methods of the present invention. </paragraph>

Spatial light modulators include, but are not limited to, Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs) and Liquid Crystal Devices (LCDs). In some embodiments, the LCD is reflective, while in other embodiments, it is transmissive of the directed (e.g., spatially modulated) light. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;microarray&rdquo; refers to a substrate with a plurality of molecules (e.g., nucleotides) bound to its surface. Microarrays, for example, are described generally in Schena, <highlight><italic>Microarray Biochip Technology, </italic></highlight>Eaton Publishing, Natick, Mass., (2000). Additionally, the term &ldquo;patterned microarrays&rdquo; refers to microarray substrates with a plurality of molecules non-randomly bound to its surface. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;optical detector&rdquo; and &ldquo;photodetector&rdquo; refers to a device that generates an output signal when exposed to optical energy. Thus, in its broadest sense, the term &ldquo;optical detector system&rdquo; refers devices for converting energy from one form to another for the purpose of measurement of a physical quantity and/or for information transfer. Optical detectors include but are not limited to photomultipliers and photodiodes, as well as fluorescence detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;TTL&rdquo; stands for Transistor-Transistor Logic, a family of digital logic chips that comprise gates, flip/flops, counters etc. The family uses zero Volt and five Volt signals to represent logical &ldquo;0&rdquo; and &ldquo;1&rdquo; respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;dynamic range&rdquo; refers to the range of input energy over which a detector and data acquisition system is useful. This range encompasses the lowest level signal that is distinguishable from noise to the highest level that can be detected without distortion or saturation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in its broadest sense refers to any undesired disturbances (i.e., signal not directly resulting from the intended detected event) within the frequency band of interest. Noise is the summation of unwanted or disturbing energy introduced into a system from man-made and natural sources. Noise may distort a signal such that the information carried by the signal becomes degraded or less reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;signal-to-noise ratio&rdquo; refers the ability to resolve true signal from the noise of a system. Signal-to-noise ratio is computed by taking the ratio of levels of the desired signal to the level of noise present with the signal. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, phenomena affecting signal-to-noise ratio include, but are not limited to, detector noise, system noise, and background artifacts. As used herein, the term &ldquo;detector noise&rdquo; refers to undesired disturbances (i.e., signal not directly resulting from the intended detected energy) that originate within the detector. Detector noise includes dark current noise and shot noise. Dark current noise in an optical detector system results from the various thermal emissions from the photodetector. Shot noise in an optical system is the product of the fundamental particle nature (i.e., Poisson-distributed energy fluctuations) of incident photons as they pass through the photodetector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;system noise&rdquo; refers to undesired disturbances that originate within the system. System noise includes, but is not limited to noise contributions from signal amplifiers, electromagnetic noise that is inadvertently coupled into the signal path, and fluctuations in the power applied to certain components (e.g., a light source) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;background artifacts&rdquo; include signal components caused by undesired optical emissions from the microarray. These artifacts arise from a number of sources, including: non-specific hybridization, intrinsic fluorescence of the substrate and/or reagents, incompletely attenuated fluorescent excitation light, and stray ambient light. In some embodiments, the noise of an optical detector system is determined by measuring the noise of the background region and noise of the signal from the microarray feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;processor&rdquo; refers to a device that performs a set of steps according to a program (e.g., a digital computer). Processors, for example, include Central Processing Units (&ldquo;CPUs&rdquo;), electronic devices, and systems for receiving, transmitting, storing and/or manipulating digital data under programmed control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;memory device,&rdquo; and &ldquo;computer memory&rdquo; refer to any data storage device that is readable by a computer, including, but not limited to, random access memory, hard disks, magnetic (e.g., floppy) disks, zip disks, compact discs, DVDs, magnetic tape, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;gene&rdquo; refers to a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) sequence that comprises coding sequences necessary for the production of a polypeptide or precursor. It is intended that the term encompass polypeptides encoded by a full length coding sequence, as well as any portion of the coding sequence, so long as the desired activity and/or functional properties (e.g., enzymatic activity, ligand binding, etc.) of the full-length or fragmented polypeptide are retained. The term also encompasses the coding region of a structural gene and the sequences located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends for a distance of about 1 kb on either end such that the gene corresponds to the length of the full-length mRNA. The sequences that are located 5&prime; of the coding region and which are present on the mRNA are referred to as &ldquo;5&prime; untranslated sequences.&rdquo; The sequences that are located 3&prime; (i.e., &ldquo;downstream&rdquo;) of the coding region and that are present on the mRNA are referred to as &ldquo;3&prime; untranslated sequences.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;gene&rdquo; encompasses both cDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A genomic form of a genetic clone contains the coding region interrupted with non-coding sequences termed &ldquo;introns&rdquo; or &ldquo;intervening regions&rdquo; or &ldquo;intervening sequences.&rdquo; Introns are segments of a gene that are transcribed into nuclear RNA (hnRNA); introns may contain regulatory elements such as enhancers. Introns are removed or &ldquo;spliced out&rdquo; from the nuclear or primary transcript; introns therefore are absent in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript. The mRNA functions during translation to specify the sequence or order of amino acids in a nascent polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Where &ldquo;amino acid sequence&rdquo; is recited herein to refer to an amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring protein molecule, &ldquo;amino acid sequence&rdquo; and like terms, such as &ldquo;polypeptide&rdquo; and &ldquo;protein&rdquo; are not meant to limit the amino acid sequence to the complete, native amino acid sequence associated with the recited protein molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In addition to containing introns, genomic forms of a gene may also include sequences located on both the 5&prime; and 3&prime; end of the sequences that are present on the RNA transcript. These sequences are referred to as &ldquo;flanking&rdquo; sequences or regions (these flanking sequences are located 5&prime; or 3&prime; to the non-translated sequences present on the mRNA transcript). The 5&prime; flanking region may contain regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers that control or influence the transcription of the gene. The 3&prime; flanking region may contain sequences that direct the termination of transcription, post-transcriptional cleavage and polyadenylation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;wild-type&rdquo; refers to a gene or gene product that has the characteristics of that gene or gene product when isolated from a naturally occurring source. A wild-type gene is that which is most frequently observed in a population and is thus arbitrarily designed the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or &ldquo;wild-type&rdquo; form of the gene. In contrast, the terms &ldquo;modified,&rdquo; &ldquo;mutant,&rdquo; and &ldquo;variant&rdquo; refer to a gene or gene product that displays modifications in sequence and or functional properties (i.e., altered characteristics) when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. It is noted that naturally-occurring mutants can be isolated; these are identified by the fact that they have altered characteristics when compared to the wild-type gene or gene product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;nucleic acid molecule encoding,&rdquo; &ldquo;DNA sequence encoding,&rdquo; and &ldquo;DNA encoding&rdquo; refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The DNA sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> DNA molecules are said to have &ldquo;5&prime; ends&rdquo; and &ldquo;3&prime; ends&rdquo; because mononucleotides are reacted to make oligonucleotides or polynucleotides in a manner such that the 5&prime; phosphate of one mononucleotide pentose ring is attached to the 3&prime; oxygen of its neighbor in one direction via a phosphodiester linkage. Therefore, an end of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide, referred to as the &ldquo;5&prime; end&rdquo; if its 5&prime; phosphate is not linked to the 3&prime; oxygen of a mononucleotide pentose ring and as the &ldquo;3&prime; end&rdquo; if its 3&prime; oxygen is not linked to a 5&prime; phosphate of a subsequent mononucleotide pentose ring. As used herein, a nucleic acid sequence, even if internal to a larger oligonucleotide or polynucleotide, also may be said to have 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends. In either a linear or circular DNA molecule, discrete elements are referred to as being &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; or 5&prime; of the &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; or 3&prime; elements. This terminology reflects the fact that transcription proceeds in a 5&prime; to 3&prime; fashion along the DNA strand. The promoter and enhancer elements that direct transcription of a linked gene are generally located 5&prime; or upstream of the coding region. However, enhancer elements can exert their effect even when located 3&prime; of the promoter element and the coding region. Transcription termination and polyadenylation signals are located 3&prime; or downstream of the coding region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;an oligonucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene&rdquo; and &ldquo;polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence encoding a gene,&rdquo; means a nucleic acid sequence comprising the coding region of a gene or, in other words, the nucleic acid sequence that encodes a gene product. The coding region may be present in either a cDNA, genomic DNA, or RNA form. When present in a DNA form, the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be single-stranded (i.e., the sense strand) or double-stranded. Suitable control elements such as enhancers/promoters, splice junctions, polyadenylation signals, etc. may be placed in close proximity to the coding region of the gene if needed to permit proper initiation of transcription and/or correct processing of the primary RNA transcript. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;regulatory element&rdquo; refers to a genetic element that controls some aspect of the expression of nucleic acid sequences. For example, a promoter is a regulatory element that facilitates the initiation of transcription of an operably linked coding region. Other regulatory elements include splicing signals, polyadenylation signals, termination signals, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; and &ldquo;complementarity&rdquo; are used in reference to polynucleotides (i.e., a sequence of nucleotides) related by the base-pairing rules. For example, for the sequence &ldquo;A-G-T,&rdquo; is complementary to the sequence &ldquo;T-C-A.&rdquo; Complementarity may be &ldquo;partial,&rdquo; in which only some of the nucleic acids&apos; bases are matched according to the base pairing rules. Or, there may be &ldquo;complete&rdquo; or &ldquo;total&rdquo; complementarity between the nucleic acids. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in amplification and hybridization reactions, as well as detection methods that depend upon binding between nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;homology&rdquo; and &ldquo;similarity&rdquo; refer to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary sequence is one that at least partially inhibits a completely complementary sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid and is referred to using the functional term &ldquo;substantially homologous.&rdquo; The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (e.g., Southern and/or Northern blots, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe competes for and inhibits the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous sequence to a target under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target that lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The art knows well that numerous equivalent conditions may be employed to comprise low stringency conditions; factors such as the length and nature (DNA, RNA, base composition) of the probe and nature of the target (DNA, RNA, base composition, present in solution or immobilized, etc.) and the concentration of the salts and other components (e.g., the presence or absence of formamide, dextran sulfate, polyethylene glycol) are considered and the hybridization solution may be varied to generate conditions of low stringency hybridization different from, but equivalent to, the above listed conditions. In addition, the art knows conditions that promote hybridization under conditions of high stringency (e.g., increasing the temperature of the hybridization and/or wash steps, the use of formamide in the hybridization solution, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> When used in reference to a double-stranded nucleic acid sequence such as a cDNA or genomic clone, the term &ldquo;substantially homologous&rdquo; refers to any probe that can hybridize to either or both strands of the double-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A gene may produce multiple RNA species that are generated by differential splicing of the primary RNA transcript. cDNAs that are splice variants of the same gene will contain regions of sequence identity or complete homology (representing the presence of the same exon or portion of the same exon on both cDNAs) and regions of complete non-identity (for example, representing the presence of exon &ldquo;A&rdquo; on cDNA 1 wherein cDNA 2 contains exon &ldquo;B&rdquo; instead). Because the two cDNAs contain regions of sequence identity they will both hybridize to a probe derived from the entire gene or portions of the gene containing sequences found on both cDNAs; the two splice variants are therefore substantially homologous to such a probe and to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> When used in reference to a single-stranded nucleic acid sequence, the term &ldquo;substantially homologous&rdquo; refers to any probe that can hybridize (i.e., it is the complement of) the single-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;hybridization&rdquo; is used in reference to the pairing of complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (i.e., the strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is impacted by such factors as the degree of complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions involved, the T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>of the formed hybrid, and the G:C ratio within the nucleic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; is used in reference to the &ldquo;melting temperature.&rdquo; The melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. The equation for calculating the T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>of nucleic acids is well known in the art. As indicated by standard references, a simple estimate of the T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>value may be calculated by the equation: T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>&equals;81.5&plus;0.41(% G&plus;C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1 M NaCl (See e.g., Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization, in <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acid Hybridization </italic></highlight>&lsqb;1985&rsqb;). Other references include more sophisticated computations that take structural as well as sequence characteristics into account for the calculation of T<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As used herein the term &ldquo;stringency&rdquo; is used in reference to the conditions of temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of other compounds such as organic solvents, under which nucleic acid hybridizations are conducted. Those skilled in the art will recognize that &ldquo;stringency&rdquo; conditions may be altered by varying the parameters just described either individually or in concert. With &ldquo;high stringency&rdquo; conditions, nucleic acid base pairing will occur only between nucleic acid fragments that have a high frequency of complementary base sequences (e.g., hybridization under &ldquo;high stringency&rdquo; conditions may occur between homologs with about 85-100% identity, preferably about 70-100% identity). With medium stringency conditions, nucleic acid base pairing will occur between nucleic acids with an intermediate frequency of complementary base sequences (e.g., hybridization under &ldquo;medium stringency&rdquo; conditions may occur between homologs with about 50-70% identity). Thus, conditions of &ldquo;weak&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo; stringency are often required with nucleic acids that are derived from organisms that are genetically diverse, as the frequency of complementary sequences is usually less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Amplification&rdquo; is a special case of nucleic acid replication involving template specificity. It is to be contrasted with non-specific template replication (i.e., replication that is template-dependent but not dependent on a specific template). Template specificity is here distinguished from fidelity of replication (i.e., synthesis of the proper polynucleotide sequence) and nucleotide (ribo- or deoxyribo-) specificity. Template specificity is frequently described in terms of &ldquo;target&rdquo; specificity. Target sequences are &ldquo;targets&rdquo; in the sense that they are sought to be sorted out from other nucleic acid. Amplification techniques have been designed primarily for this sorting out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Template specificity is achieved in most amplification techniques by the choice of enzyme. Amplification enzymes are enzymes that, under conditions they are used, will process only specific sequences of nucleic acid in a heterogeneous mixture of nucleic acid. For example, in the case of Q-replicase, MDV-1 RNA is the specific template for the replicase (Kacian et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 69:3038 &lsqb;1972&rsqb;). Other nucleic acid will not be replicated by this amplification enzyme. Similarly, in the case of T7 RNA polymerase, this amplification enzyme has a stringent specificity for its own promoters (Chamberlin et al, Nature, 228:227 &lsqb;1970&rsqb;). In the case of T4 DNA ligase, the enzyme will not ligate the two oligonucleotides or polynucleotides, where there is a mismatch between the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide substrate and the template at the ligation junction (Wu and Wallace, Genomics, 4:560 &lsqb;1989&rsqb;). Finally, Taq and Pfu polymerases, by virtue of their ability to function at high temperature, are found to display high specificity for the sequences bounded and thus defined by the primers; the high temperature results in thermodynamic conditions that favor primer hybridization with the target sequences and not hybridization with non-target sequences (H. A. Erlich (ed.), PCR Technology, Stockton Press &lsqb;1989&rsqb;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;amplifiable nucleic acid&rdquo; is used in reference to nucleic acids that may be amplified by any amplification method. It is contemplated that &ldquo;amplifiable nucleic acid&rdquo; will usually comprise &ldquo;sample template.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;sample template&rdquo; refers to nucleic acid originating from a sample that is analyzed for the presence of &ldquo;target&rdquo; (defined below). In contrast, &ldquo;background template&rdquo; is used in reference to nucleic acid other than sample template that may or may not be present in a sample. Background template is most often inadvertent. It may be the result of carryover, or it may be due to the presence of nucleic acid contaminants sought to be purified away from the sample. For example, nucleic acids from organisms other than those to be detected may be present as background in a test sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;primer&rdquo; refers to an oligonucleotide, whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, which is capable of acting as a point of initiation of synthesis when placed under conditions in which synthesis of a primer extension product which is complementary to a nucleic acid strand is induced, (i.e., in the presence of nucleotides and an inducing agent such as DNA polymerase and at a suitable temperature and pH). The primer is preferably single stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification, but may alternatively be double stranded. If double stranded, the primer is first treated to separate its strands before being used to prepare extension products. Preferably, the primer is an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The primer must be sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of extension products in the presence of the inducing agent. The exact lengths of the primers will depend on many factors, including temperature, source of primer and the use of the method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;probe&rdquo; refers to a molecule (e.g., an oligonucleotide, whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, recombinantly or by PCR amplification), that is capable of hybridizing to another molecule of interest (e.g., another oligonucleotide). When probes are oligonucleotides they may be single-stranded or double-stranded. Probes are useful in the detection, identification and isolation of particular targets (e.g., gene sequences). In some embodiments, it is contemplated that probes used in the present invention are labelled with any &ldquo;reporter molecule,&rdquo; so that is detectable in any detection system, including, but not limited to enzyme (e.g., ELISA, as well as enzyme-based histochemical assays), fluorescent, radioactive, and luminescent systems. It is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular label. With respect to microarrays, the term probe is used to refer to any hybridizable material that is affixed to the microarray for the purpose of detecting &ldquo;target&rdquo; sequences in the analyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As used herein &ldquo;probe element&rdquo; and &ldquo;probe site&rdquo; refer to a plurality of probe molecules (e.g., identical probe molecules) affixed to a microarray substrate. Probe elements containing different characteristic molecules are typically arranged in a two-dimensional array, for example, by microfluidic spotting techniques or by patterned photolithographic synthesis, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;target,&rdquo; when used in reference to hybridization assays, refers to the molecules (e.g., nucleic acid) to be detected. Thus, the &ldquo;target&rdquo; is sought to be sorted out from other molecules (e.g., nucleic acid sequences) or is to be identified as being present in a sample through its specific interaction (e.g., hybridization) with another agent (e.g., a probe oligonucleotide). A &ldquo;segment&rdquo; is defined as a region of nucleic acid within the target sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;polymerase chain reaction&rdquo; (&ldquo;PCR&rdquo;) refers to the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202, and 4,965,188, hereby incorporated by reference, that describe a method for increasing the concentration of a segment of a target sequence in a mixture of genomic DNA without cloning or purification. This process for amplifying the target sequence consists of introducing a large excess of two oligonucleotide primers to the DNA mixture containing the desired target sequence, followed by a precise sequence of thermal cycling in the presence of a DNA polymerase. The two primers are complementary to their respective strands of the double stranded target sequence. To effect amplification, the mixture is denatured and the primers then annealed to their complementary sequences within the target molecule. Following annealing, the primers are extended with a polymerase so as to form a new pair of complementary strands. The steps of denaturation, primer annealing, and polymerase extension can be repeated many times (i.e., denaturation, annealing and extension constitute one &ldquo;cycle&rdquo;; there can be numerous &ldquo;cycles&rdquo;) to obtain a high concentration of an amplified segment of the desired target sequence. The length of the amplified segment of the desired target sequence is determined by the relative positions of the primers with respect to each other, and therefore, this length is a controllable parameter. By virtue of the repeating aspect of the process, the method is referred to as the &ldquo;polymerase chain reaction&rdquo; (hereinafter &ldquo;PCR&rdquo;). Because the desired amplified segments of the target sequence become the predominant sequences (in terms of concentration) in the mixture, they are said to be &ldquo;PCR amplified.&rdquo; In addition to genomic DNA, any oligonucleotide or polynucleotide sequence can be amplified with the appropriate set of primer molecules. In particular, the amplified segments created by the PCR process itself are, themselves, efficient templates for subsequent PCR amplifications. With PCR, it is possible to amplify a single copy of a specific target sequence in genomic DNA to a level detectable by the device and systems of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;PCR product,&rdquo; &ldquo;PCR fragment,&rdquo; and &ldquo;amplification product&rdquo; refer to the resultant mixture of compounds after two or more cycles of the PCR steps of denaturation, annealing and extension are complete. These terms encompass the case where there has been amplification of one or more segments of one or more target sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;amplification reagents&rdquo; refers to those reagents (deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, buffer, etc.), needed for amplification except for primers, nucleic acid template, and the amplification enzyme. Typically, amplification reagents along with other reaction components are placed and contained in a reaction vessel (test tube, microwell, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;reverse-transcriptase&rdquo; and &ldquo;RT-PCR&rdquo; refer to a type of PCR where the starting material is mRNA. The starting mRNA is enzymatically converted to complementary DNA or &ldquo;cDNA&rdquo; using a reverse transcriptase enzyme. The cDNA is then used as a &ldquo;template&rdquo; for a &ldquo;PCR&rdquo; reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;restriction endonucleases&rdquo; and &ldquo;restriction enzymes&rdquo; refer to bacterial enzymes, each of which cut double-stranded DNA at or near a specific nucleotide sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;recombinant DNA molecule&rdquo; as used herein refers to a DNA molecule that is comprised of segments of DNA joined together by means of molecular biological techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;antisense&rdquo; is used in reference to RNA sequences that are complementary to a specific RNA sequence (e.g., mRNA). Included within this definition are antisense RNA (&ldquo;asRNA&rdquo;) molecules involved in gene regulation by bacteria. Antisense RNA may be produced by any method, including synthesis by splicing the gene(s) of interest in a reverse orientation to a viral promoter that permits the synthesis of a coding strand. Once introduced into an embryo, this transcribed strand combines with natural mRNA produced by the embryo to form duplexes. These duplexes then block either the further transcription of the mRNA or its translation. In this manner, mutant phenotypes may be generated. The term &ldquo;antisense strand&rdquo; is used in reference to a nucleic acid strand that is complementary to the &ldquo;sense&rdquo; strand. The designation (&minus;) (i.e., &ldquo;negative&rdquo;) is sometimes used in reference to the antisense strand, with the designation (&plus;) sometimes used in reference to the sense (i.e., &ldquo;positive&rdquo;) strand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; when used in relation to a nucleic acid, as in &ldquo;an isolated oligonucleotide&rdquo; or &ldquo;isolated polynucleotide&rdquo; refers to a nucleic acid sequence that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid with which it is ordinarily associated in its natural source. Isolated nucleic acid is present in a form or setting that is different from that in which it is found in nature. In contrast, non-isolated nucleic acids are nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA found in the state they exist in nature. For example, a given DNA sequence (e.g., a gene) is found on the host cell genome in proximity to neighboring genes; RNA sequences, such as a specific mRNA sequence encoding a specific protein, are found in the cell as a mixture with numerous other mRNAs that encode a multitude of proteins. The isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide, or polynucleotide may be present in single-stranded or double-stranded form. When an isolated nucleic acid, oligonucleotide or polynucleotide is to be utilized to express a protein, the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide will contain at a minimum the sense or coding strand (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may single-stranded), but may contain both the sense and anti-sense strands (i.e., the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide may be double-stranded). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;sequences associated with a genome&rdquo; means preparations of genomes (e.g., spreads of metaphase chromosomes of eukaryotes), nucleic acid extracted from a sample containing DNA (e.g., preparations of genomic DNA); the RNA that is produced by transcription of genes located on a chromosome (e.g., hnRNA and mRNA); and cDNA copies of the RNA transcribed from the DNA located in a genome. Sequences associated with a genome may be detected by numerous techniques including probing of Southern and Northern blots and in situ hybridization to RNA, DNA (or metaphase chromosomes) with probes containing sequences homologous to the nucleic acids in the above listed preparations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As used herein the term &ldquo;coding region&rdquo; when used in reference to a structural gene refers to the nucleotide sequences that encode the amino acids found in the nascent polypeptide as a result of translation of a mRNA molecule. The coding region is bounded, in eukaryotes, on the 5&prime; side by the nucleotide triplet &ldquo;ATG&rdquo; that encodes the initiator methionine and on the 3&prime; side by one of the three triplets which specify stop codons (i.e., TA, TAG, TGA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the terms &ldquo;purified&rdquo; and &ldquo;to purify&rdquo; refer to the removal of contaminants from a sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;recombinant DNA molecule&rdquo; as used herein refers to a DNA molecule that is comprised of segments of DNA joined together by means of molecular biological techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As used herein the term &ldquo;portion&rdquo; when in reference to a nucleotide sequence (as in &ldquo;a portion of a given nucleotide sequence&rdquo;) refers to fragments of that sequence. The fragments may range in size from four nucleotides to the entire nucleotide sequence minus one nucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;recombinant protein&rdquo; and &ldquo;recombinant polypeptide&rdquo; as used herein refer to a protein molecule that are expressed from a recombinant DNA molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> As used herein the term &ldquo;biologically active polypeptide&rdquo; refers to any polypeptide which maintains a desired biological activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> As used herein the term &ldquo;portion&rdquo; when in reference to a protein (as in &ldquo;a portion of a given protein&rdquo;) refers to fragments of that protein. The fragments may range in size from four amino acid residues to the entire amino acid sequence minus one amino acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;antigenic determinant&rdquo; as used herein refers to that portion of an antigen that makes contact with a particular antibody (i.e., an epitope). When a protein or fragment of a protein is used to immunize a host animal, numerous regions of the protein may induce the production of antibodies that bind specifically to a given region or three-dimensional structure on the protein; these regions or structures are referred to as antigenic determinants. An antigenic determinant may compete with the intact antigen (i.e., the &ldquo;immunogen&rdquo; used to elicit the immune response) for binding to an antibody. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In this Example, the production of one microarray embodiment is described. Genomic DNAs from four fluorescent Pseudomonas strains (<highlight><italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens </italic></highlight>(ATCC 13525<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>), <highlight><italic>P. chlororaphis </italic></highlight>(ATCC 9447), <highlight><italic>P. putida </italic></highlight>(ATCC 12633<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>), and <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>(ATCC 15692); i.e., the &ldquo;reference strains&rdquo;) were fragmented by bead-beating to ensure randomness, and the fragments were size-fractionated (1 to 2 kb) by agarose gel electrophoresis, as known in the art. The QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) was used to elute and purify DNA from the agarose gel, according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. The genomic DNA fragments were inserted to pPCR-Script Amp vector (Stratagene), then PCR amplified with the T3/T7 promoter primer set using standard PCR conditions, with a primer annealing temperature of 55&deg; C. Amplified genomic DNA fragments were purified with QIAquick 8 PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and quantified with PicoGreen (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Purified DNAs were resuspended (200 ng/&mgr;l) in 3&times;SSC (1&times;SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, plus 0.015 M sodium citrate), and printed using approximately 1 nl/spot, on CMT-GAPS amino silane coated slides (Coming). In these experiments, 92, 90, 96, and 60 fragments from <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens, P. chlororaphis, P. putida, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>were spotted in duplicate, respectively. Yeast gene STE (pheromone receptor gene; GenBank accession no. M12239) was spotted as positive control, and yeast gene ACT (actin gene; GenBank accession no. L00026), lambda DNA, and water were spotted as negative controls. PCR primer pair, STE3F1 (CCC CTT CAA AAT TGG AGC TTG C; SEQ ID NO: 1) and STE3R1 (CCC CCT TTA GCA TGG CAT TCA; SEQ ID NO: 2), and pair ACT1F1 (GAT GGA GCC AAA GCG GTG A (SEQ ID NO: 3) and ACT1R1 (GCG CTT GCA CCA TCC CAT T; SEQ ID NO: 4) were used to amplify the STE and ACT yeast genes, respectively. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Genomic DNA Labeling and Hybridization </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In this Example, labeling and hybridization experiments conducted using one embodiment of the present invention are described. Genomic DNAs (1 &mgr;g) from all the strains listed above, including the reference strains, were labeled with FluoroLink Cy3-dCTP (Amersham) by random priming using High Prime (Roche), and used as test DNAs. Mixtures of genomic DNA (1 &mgr;g) from the four reference strains (1:1:1:1) used for microarray fabrication were labeled with FluoroLink Cy5-dCTP (Amersham) and used as reference DNA for signal ratio calculation (Cy3-Test/Cy5-Ref). Yeast gene STE (10 ng) was included in each labeling reaction as a positive control, as well as an internal standard (IS; Cy3-IS and Cy5-IS) for labeling efficiency correction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The arrays were pre-hybridized in pre-hybridization buffer (3.5&times;SSC, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at 65&deg; C., hybridized with approximately 1 &mgr;g of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled DNA mixture (1:1) in hybridization buffer (3&times;SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA) at 65&deg; C. overnight, then washed once with primary wash buffer (0.1&times;SSC, 0.1% SDS) at room temperature for 5 min and twice with secondary wash buffer (0.1&times;SSC) for 5 min. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Statistical Analyses of Hybridized Arrays </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In this Example, the methods used to analyze the data obtained from the hybridized arrays of one embodiment of the present invention are described. Hybridized arrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000 laser scanner (Axon). Laser lights of wavelength at 532 and 635 nm were used to excite Cy3 dye and Cy5 dyes, respectively. Fluorescent images were captured as multi-image-tagged image file format (TIFF) and analyzed with GenePix Pro 3.0 software (Axon). The ratio (R) of the extent of hybridization between test DNAs and reference DNAs was derived from a median value of pixel-by-pixel ratios. By using this approach to calculate R, non-specific signals, which appear in both wavelength images, were found to have less of an effect than when the mean values of a whole spot were used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Hybridization signal ratios (R) between test DNA and reference DNA (Cy3-Test/Cy5 Test/Cy5-Ref) were calculated and corrected with the correction factor (c&equals;Cy5-IS/Cy3-IS) from the internal standard (yeast gene STE) (corrected signal ratio R&prime;&equals;c&times;&lsqb;Cy3-Test/Cy5-Ref&rsqb;). Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to find relationships between hybridization patterns and transformed to a percentage scale. Unweighted arithmetic average clustering (UPGMA) was used for hierarchical data ordination. For characterizing the shape of hybridization signal distribution, an evenness (E) value of each spotted genome fragment was calculated based on information theory (Legendre and Legendre, <highlight><italic>Numerical Ecology, </italic></highlight>Elsevier Science, Amsterdam &lsqb;1998&rsqb;; and Pielou, J. Theor. Biol., 13:131-144 &lsqb;1966&rsqb;) using the equation E&equals;(&minus;&Sgr; p log p )/log q; where p is the relative proportion of hybridization signal ratio (R&prime;), and q is the total number of hybridizations performed. Since the distribution of the calculated E values was highly skewed (skewness &equals;&minus;0.855), the E values were normalized using arc cosine transformation. An arc cosine-transformed evenness value, &thgr;<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>, was used to represent the degree of conservation of each genome fragment. Microsoft EXCEL, SYSTAT (SPSS) and NTSYS-pc (Exeter) were used for all statistical calculations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The ratio of Cy5 to Cy3 incorporation (Cy5-IS/Cy3-IS) during the DNA labeling was found to be 1.04&plusmn;0.32 for all experiments. As indicated above, an incorporation ratio (c&equals;Cy5-IS/Cy3-IS) obtained from each microarray was used as a correction factor for hybridization signal calibration (corrected signal ratio R&prime;&equals;c&times;&lsqb;Cy3-Test/Cy5-Ref&rsqb;). The correction factor, however, did not affect the correlation coefficient calculation, since the correlation coefficient is independent of any constant (e.g., &ldquo;c&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In order to test the reproducibility of array hybridization, seven arrays were hybridized to genomic DNAs of <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>(ATCC 13525<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>) (3 times), <highlight><italic>P. putida </italic></highlight>(ATCC 12633<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>) (2 times), and <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>(ATCC 15692) (2 times). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the scatter plot representation of triplicate hybridization profiles of <highlight><italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens </italic></highlight>(ATCC 13525<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>). The arrays hybridized to <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>(ATCC 13525<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>) (triplicate), <highlight><italic>P. putida </italic></highlight>ATCC (12633<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>) (duplicate), and <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>(ATCC 15692) (duplicate) showed similarity values &gt;97.5% (r&gt;0.949, P&lt;0.0001), 95.3% (r&equals;0.906, P&lt;0.0001), and 94.1% (r&equals;0.882, P&lt;0.0001), respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Regression analysis showed a good agreement between DNA-DNA reassociation values and the similarity coefficients obtained from these experiments, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. For these experiments, the coefficient of determination (r<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) was 0.713. Order 1 of linear relationship and the regression coefficient (slope, 0.718) indicated that the microarray method has a similar resolution to the whole genomic DNA-DNA hybridization method. However, the two methods lost their linear relationships below 50% of DNA-DNA similarity, which approximately corresponds to a 60% similarity coefficient obtained by the DNA microarray method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> A similar result was observed with the relationship between repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR genomic DNA fingerprint similarity and percent DNA similarity values (Rademaker et al., Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol., 50:665-677 &lsqb;2000&rsqb;). REP-PCR fingerprinting (Rademaker et al., in Akkermans et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Microbial Ecology Manual, </italic></highlight>Suppl. 3, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands &lsqb;1998&rsqb;, pp. 1-26) lost resolution when applied to strains of below 70% of DNA similarity, indicating that REP-PCR fingerprinting is only capable of resolving relationships among very closely related strains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In contrast, in these experiments, the DNA chip method of the present invention showed linearity over a broader span of DNA similarity values (50 to 100%) but provided slightly less resolution at &gt;70% DNA similarity values than for the REP-PCR fingerprinting method. However, the microarray method of the present invention is still able to resolve closely related strains and, more importantly, provides resolution over the gap between REP-PCR fingerprinting and 16S rDNA analysis (Cho and Tiedje, <highlight><italic>Abstracts of the </italic></highlight>100<highlight><italic>th General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, </italic></highlight>Abstr. N-171, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C. &lsqb;2000&rsqb;, at pages 489-490). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In addition, situations in which different strains of the same species have differences in genome size (e.g., <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>K12, as compared to <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>0157; GenBank accession nos. U00096 and AE005174, respectively) were taken into consideration. It is not contemplated that this scale of difference (1 of 5 Mb) will invalidate the methods of the present invention, although the percent similarity should be slightly higher than the average percent similarity from whole-genome DNA-DNA hybridization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Based on cluster analysis of the overall topology of the dendrogram of similarity coefficient matrix was consistent with the phylogenetic tree obtained from 16S rDNA sequence data (Moore et al., Sys. Appl. Microbiol., 19:478-492 &lsqb;1996&rsqb;) except for <highlight><italic>P. putida </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>clusters, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>group clustered with <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. chlororaphis </italic></highlight>groups at a higher similarity (67.9%) than for the <highlight><italic>P. putida </italic></highlight>group (39.0%), the latter of which generally shows greater 16S rDNA similarity to <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. chlororaphis </italic></highlight>than to <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>(Moore et al., supra). However, a similar result to these array data was reported by Palleroni et al. (Palleroni et al., J. Bacteriol., 110:1-11 &lsqb;1972&rsqb;), using DNA-DNA similarity values, where the <highlight><italic>P. aeruginosa </italic></highlight>group was found to be a closer relative to the <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>group than was the <highlight><italic>P. putida </italic></highlight>group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> All replicate experiments showed similarity coefficients of &gE;94% (r&equals;0.88), and all different strains were distinguished at similarity values of &lE;91% (r&equals;0.82). Hence, similarity coefficients of &lt;92 to 94% (r&equals;0.84 to 0.88) reliably define different hybridization groups. Using the regression equation from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> cut-off value of 77% was calculated to correspond to a 70% DNA homology value to define &ldquo;species&rdquo; (Wayne et al., Int. J. Sys. Bacteriol., 37:463-464 &lsqb;1987&rsqb;). This cut-off resolved the <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens, P. chlororaphis, P. aeruginosa, </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. putida </italic></highlight>species, but did not resolve <highlight><italic>P. marginalis </italic></highlight>from <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens, </italic></highlight>nor <highlight><italic>P. aureofaciens </italic></highlight>from <highlight><italic>P. chlororaphis. </italic></highlight>However, these latter pairs of species are known to be very similar, based on other methods of analysis. For example, <highlight><italic>P. aureofaciens </italic></highlight>(ATCC 13985<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>) and <highlight><italic>P. chlororaphis </italic></highlight>(ATCC 9447) show 85% DNA homology (Palleroni et al., supra). In addition, the 16S rDNA similarity between <highlight><italic>P. aureofaciens </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. chlororaphis, </italic></highlight>and between <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>P. marginalis </italic></highlight>are 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively (results from different strains) (Moore et al., supra). <highlight><italic>P. marginalis </italic></highlight>is also reported to have very similar characteristics to <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens, </italic></highlight>and was previously classified as <highlight><italic>P. fluorescens </italic></highlight>(Misaghi and Grogan, Phytopathol., 59:1436-1450 &lsqb;1969&rsqb;; Pecknold and Grogan, Int.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to magnetic nanowires. In particular, the invention provides multisegmented, multifunctional magnetic nanowires for the probing and manipulation of molecules at the cellular and subcellular level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The ability to selectively probe and manipulate molecules at the cellular and subcellular level is critical in both basic research and the development of biotechnology applications. One powerful method to do this is to use small particles that interact with specific molecules or individual cells, and which respond to a magnetic field. This approach has found widespread application in cell sorting, biosensing, and studies of mechanical properties of cells using magnetic particles or beads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, particles or beads having magnetic properties have previously been used in separation support systems (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,834,121; 5,395,688; 5,356,713; 4,774,265; and 4,554,088, incorporated by reference herein). In particular, magnetically separable support systems have been suggested for the detection of biomolecules by attaching a ligand to a magnetizable bead, attaching a detection molecule to the ligand, permitting the detection molecule to bind to a target molecule, and retrieving the resulting product by use of a magnetic field or other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, a significant limitation of these magnetic carriers is that they have only a single chemical functionality per particle. Further, such magnetic beads or particles have a relatively uniform structure and therefore display relatively uniform magnetic properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would be of benefit to have available magnetic entities which could be used to selectively manipulate and probe molecules at the cellular and subcellular level which contained multiple chemical functionalities per entity. Further, it would be of benefit if the multiple chemical functionalities were spatially resolved from each other. In addition, it would be of benefit if the magnetic properties of such entities could be manipulated and tailored to give the entities a variety of responses to an applied magnetic field. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide magnetic nanowires comprising one or more segments in which a molecular functional group or ligand has beenbound to the surface of at least one segment of the wires. The wires are fabricated from materials such as platinum, iron, cobalt, nickel, gold, silver, copper, iron oxide, copper oxide, zinc oxide, and alloys of these materials such as FeCo, NiFe, AuAg, and CuNi. In multisegmented wires, a specific functional group is localized to a particular segment. Examples of such functional groups are thiols, disulfides, amines, cyanides, carboxylic acids, phosphonates, siloxanes, and hydroxamic acids. Further, the wire may comprise ligands associated with the wire, either directly to the wire or via a functional group. In multisegmented wires, the ligands are localized to a particular segment. Examples of ligands include proteins, fibronectin, DNA, RNA, enzymes, ribozymes, hydrophobic materials, hydrophillic materials, saccharides, cells, tissue, microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, and chemoattractants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The wire or one or more segments of the wire may be formed from a fluorescent or luminescent material, or may have an associated fluorescent label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, a method of forming a functionalized magnetic nanowire is provided. The method comprises providing a magnetic nanowire having one or more segments, and associating functional groups or ligands with at least of one said segments. The segments may be formed from a material such as platinum, iron, cobalt, nickel, gold, silver, copper, iron oxide, copper oxide, zinc oxide, and alloys of these materials such as FeCo, NiFe, AuAg, and CuNi. Potential functional groups include non-adhesive compounds, thiols, disulfides, cyanides, carboxylic acids, phosphonates, siloxanes, and hydroxamic acids. Potential ligands include proteins, DNA, RNA, enzymes, ribozymes, hydrophobic materials, hydrophillic materials, saccharides, cells, tissue, microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, fibronectin, and chemoattractants. At least one segment of the wire may be formed from a fluorescent or photoluminescent material, and the nanowire may have an associated photoluminescent label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a method of binding a target molecule with a magnetic nanowire. The method comprises contacting the target molecule with the magnetic nanowire. The magnetic nanowire comprises at least one segment associated with a functional group or ligand capable of binding to the target molecule. The functional group or ligand is allowed to bind the target molecule. Potential functional groups are non-adhesive compounds, thiols, disulfides, cyanides, carboxylic acids, phosphonates, siloxanes, and hydroxamic acids. Potential ligands include proteins, fibronectin, DNA, RNA, enzymes, ribozymes, hydrophobic materials, hydrophillic materials, saccharides, cells, tissue, microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, and chemoattractants. The method may further include identification of the target molecule, as well as manipulating or retrieving the nanowire after the target molecule is bound to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of binding a magnetic nanowire to a cell. The method involves contacting the cell with the magnetic nanowire. The magnetic nanowire has associated with it functional groups or ligands capable of binding to the cell. The functional groups or ligands are allowed to to bind to the cell. In one embodiment, the nanowire is assembled into a two- or three dimensional structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a magnetized cell. The magnetized cell comprises a cell, and a magnetic nanowire associated with the cell.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides magnetic nanowires and methods for their use in the selective manipulation and probing of molecules at the cellular and subcellular level. The magnetic nanowires of the present invention provide advantages over previously known magnetic beads and particles in that they may be multiply functionalized. In one embodiment of the invention, the nanowires may be multisegmented and multifunctional, i.e. multiple, localized functional groups may be present on each wire. This is possible because the different segments of the wire are formed from different materials and are therefore able to selectively bind with the functional groups. Different functional groups are thus attached to different segments of the wire and are spatially resolved from each other along the length of the nanowire. Individual segments of the nanowires may be fabricated so that, in addition to differentially reacting with functional groups, they may also display varying properties. For example, at least one of the segments of the nanowires of the present invention is magnetic but other segments may be nonmagnetic. Further, the magnetic segments may be fabricated so that they display differing degrees and types of magnetism, as is described in detail below. Due to the fact that the wires are magnetic, they may be readily detected and retrieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An schematic illustration of the nanowires of the present invention compared to known unifunctionalized magnetic beads is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A and B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> depicts a previously available micron-sized magnetic bead consisting of magnetic particles embedded in a polymer matrix. The bead has a terminal end group, R. In contrast, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> depicts an exemplary nanowire in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The multifunctional exemplary nanowire depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> has two segments designated as A and B. In this example, A represents a non-magnetic noble metal (e.g., Au) while B represents a magnetic metal (e.g., Fe or Ni). Segment A is functionalized with functional group S (thiol) which is bound to terminal end group R. However, segment B is functionalized with different functional group CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(carboxylate) which is bound to different terminal end group R&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Those of skill in the art will recognize that the nanowires of the present invention may be formed from a variety of suitable materials. Such materials include, but are not limited to metals such as platinum, iron, cobalt, nickel, gold, silver, copper, either in pure or alloyed form, or compounds such as iron oxide or the semiconductors copper oxide and zinc oxide. In a preferred embodiment of the instant invention, the magnetic segments of nanowires are fabricated of ferromagnetic materials such as Co or Ni. The nanowires may be comprised solely of magnetic materials, or of a mixture of magnetic and nonmagnetic materials. Those of skill in the art will recognize that the nanowires of the present invention may be fabricated from any suitable material so long as the resulting nanowires can be utilized in the practice of the present invention. Examples of such materials and their relevant properties are given in Table 1.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The nanowires of the present invention are quasi-one-dimensional entities with large aspect ratios. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the diameter of a nanowire is in the range of about 10-300 nanometers, and the length of the nanowire is from 10 nm to tens of microns. However, those of skill in the art will recognize that the preferred dimensions of a nanowire will vary from application to application, and that the dimensions of a nanowire can be adjusted during fabrication so as to be of a length suitable for a particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Nanowires may be fabricated by any suitable method known in the art. In one embodiment of the invention, nanowires are fabricated by electrodeposition of the substrate into nanoporous templates. &lsqb;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&rsqb;. This approach offers several advantages, including the ability to fabricate large numbers of nanowires, and to introduce composition modulation along the length of the wires. The template material maintains the nanowires within its thickness, and the nanowires are usually perpendicular to the plane of the template. By using templates with many, parallel-walled nanopores, arrays of nanowires can be grown with wire diameters from a few nanometers up to tens of microns, wire lengths up to 100 &mgr;m, and areal densities up to 10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>(limited by wire diameter). However, since many essential characteristics of the nanowires, such as shape, size, and surface roughness, directly reflect the properties of the pores, templates with well-controlled pore morphology are crucial for nanowire fabrication by this tehcnique. Examples of templates include polycarbonate membranes or mica films containing etched nuclear particle tracks &lsqb;<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&rsqb;, porous alumina films formed by anodic oxidation of aluminum &lsqb;<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&rsqb;, and nanochannel glass films &lsqb;<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In fabricating nanowires by electrodeposition, one side of the porous template is usually coated with a metal layer, which serves as a working electrode in a three-electrode deposition cell. The deposition takes place inside the nanopores, starting from the metal layer. Multisegmented nanowires are made by either sequentially changing the deposition solution, or from single multi-reagent solutions by varying the deposition potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> To create suspensions of nanowires, the nanowires are first removed from the template by dissolving the template material. For example, polycarbonate is dissolved in chloroform, alumina is dissolved in warm potassium hydroxide, and mica is dissolved in hydrofluoric acid. After suitable cleaning, the wires may be suspended in a variety of solvents by ultrasonic agitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The magnetic properties of a nanowire, or of individual segments of a nanowire, can be &ldquo;tuned&rdquo;. By &ldquo;tuning&rdquo; we mean that the composition or morphology of the wire can be adjusted to vary the magnetic behavior of the wire, for example by controlling the strength, existence, or orientation of its permanent magnetic moment, to change the way it responds to a magnetic field. The tuning of the wire is accomplished by precisely varying parameters such as the size, shape, and composition of the segments. For example, wires may be fabricated via the alternating deposition of two or more different magnetic materials along the length of the wire. In addition, the magnetic properties of the wire may be further modified by the introduction of non-magnetic segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Nanowires may also be &ldquo;tuned&rdquo; by introducing alterations in their morphology. Nanowires with long magnetic segments form single-domain ferromagnetic states with large coercive fields (H<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&ap;40 kA/m (500 Oersteads) for Ni) due to their magnetic shape anisotropy. Based on the bulk saturation magnetization, M<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>&ap;1.7&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>A/m (1700 Oe) for Fe and M<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>&ap;5&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>A/m (500 Oe) for Ni, a typical nanowire with length L&equals;10 &mgr;m, and diameter d&equals;100 nm will have a magnetic moment &mgr;&ap;1.4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;13 </superscript></highlight>Am<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for Fe, and &mgr;&ap;4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;-</superscript></highlight>Am<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for Ni independent of the applied field. This is comparable to the typical saturated magnetic moment &mgr;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>for magnetic beads and thus similar forces may be applied at high fields to the nanowires as to the beads. However, since beads are superparamagnetic, they achieve &mgr;<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>in fields H exceeding 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>A/m (1.25 kOe). Thus, at low fields, larger forces can be applied to the nanowires of the present invention than to magnetic beads </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For example, nanowires can be constructed that have low moments in small fields. These wires are useful, for example, in applications in which it is desirable to minimize inter-wire interactions that can lead to aggregation. This is done with wires with disk-shaped magnetic segments by exploiting interlayer magnetic coupling across non-magnetic spacer segments &lsqb;<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>&rsqb;. By appropriately choosing the spacer&apos;s thickness, this coupling is antiferromagnetic, and the resulting anti-parallel alignment of the segments produces wires with no net moment in zero field. Above a threshold field, this coupling is overwhelmed, and the segments&apos; moments align, giving the wire a net moment and producing a corresponding force on it due to the action of the field on this magnetic moment. By varying the spacer thickness, the interlayer coupling strength can be varied, and the threshold field for the application of a force to different nanowires can be tuned (see e.g. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). This permits the development of multicomponent nanowires with tunable threshold fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Thus, by combining different deposition strategies, it is possible to create a wide variety of nanowires, each of which is tuned or tailored to possess desired behavior in response to magnetic fields. Any number or combination of magnetic or non-magnetic segments arranged in any desired pattern may form a nanowire in accordance with embodiments of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> schematically depicts the tuning of the magnetic moment of exemplary nanowires. In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, Wire (a) has a larger magnetic moment than Wire (b) even though they are the same length. In contrast, Wire (c) retains the same dimensions as Wire (a) but has a smaller magnetic moment due to the introduction of a non-magnetic segment. In Wire (d), the introduction of disk-shaped magnetic segments which are short compared to their diameter makes the wire align with its long axis perpendicular to a magnetic field. In all cases, (a)-(d), the same material may be used. This is due to magnetic shape anisotropy that makes the magnetic moment of a disk preferentially lie in the plane of the disk, perpendicular to the axis of the wire. When the disks&apos; moments align parallel to the field, the wire rotates to be perpendicular to the field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment, the nanowires of the present invention may be modified with functional groups. The functional groups may be atoms or groups of atoms that are capable of further chemical reactivity such as reacting with a ligand to attach the ligand to the wire, or to bind a target molecule. Further, different segments of the same nanowire may be functionalized with different functional groups, providing multiple discrete functional regions that are spatially resolved along the length of the wire. For example, a first segment of a nanowire may comprise a metal oxide or a metal with a native oxide layer whose surface can be functionalized with a functional group such as a carboxylic acid group. A second segment of the nanowire may comprise a non-magnetic substrate, such as gold, which can be functionalized with a thiol group. Thus, an exemplary two segment nanowire may be functionalized with two independent functional groups wherein each functional group may have different chemical properties. Examples of functional groups that may be used in accordance with alternative embodiments of the invention are set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Such functional groups may be capable of interacting directly with a molecule or cell of interest in the methods of the present invention. However, the functional group may serve to link or attach to the nanowire a secondary molecule or ligand that is capable of interacting with a molecule or cell of interest in the methods of the present invention. The term &ldquo;ligand&rdquo; refers to any entity capable of specifically or non-specifically binding to, attracting, localizing in proximity to, or detecting the presence of a target molecule. The term &ldquo;target molecule&rdquo; refers to any molecule capable of specifically or non-specifically binding to a ligand. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, different ligands are linked to different segments of the nanowire. For example, a first ligand (e.g. an antibody specific for a protein A) may be linked to a first segment of the nanowire, and a second ligand (e.g. an antibody specific for a protein B) may be linked to a second segment of the nanowire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the process of linking a ligand to a nanowire via a functional group, the functional group may be first attached to the nanowire, and then the nanowire may be reacted with the ligand to tether the ligand to the nanowire. Alternatively, the ligand itself may be derivatized so as to contain a functional group suitable for linking it directly to a wire. In fact, some suitable secondary molecules may inherently possess a &ldquo;functional group&rdquo; (e.g. the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues, and the carboxy- and amino-terminal functional groups of polypeptides) that are suitable for directly reacting with a segment of a wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Other molecular groups may also be included in the linking arrangement. For example, linear or branched alkyl chains or other polymers may be introduced between the wire and a ligand in order to, for example, position the ligand further from the surface of the wire, or to offer the possibility of introducing more than one ligand per functional group to order to increase ligand density on the wire. Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are many strategies for attaching a useful ligands to the magnetic nanowires of the present invention. All such variations and modifications are intended to be encompassed by the present invention. A &ldquo;functionalized nanowire&rdquo; is one which has been modified to contain a moiety which is added to the wire after fabrication, for example, a functional group such as a thiol, or a linking molecule such as an alkyl chain, or a ligand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Examples of ligands which are suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, molecules and macromolecules such as proteins and fragments of proteins, peptides and polypeptides, antibodies, receptors, enzymes, substrates, substrate analogs, ribozymes, structural proteins, nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA and DNA/RNA hybrids, saccharides, lipids, various hydrophobic or hydrophillic substances, lipophilic materials, chemoattractants, enzymes, hormones, fibronectin. and the like. Further, such molecules and macromolecules may be naturally occurring or synthetic in nature. The term ligand may also include larger entities such as cells, tissues, entire microorganisms, viruses, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Those of skill in the art will recognize that, in many circumstances, the terms &ldquo;ligand&rdquo; and &ldquo;target molecule&rdquo; are not absolute and may be interchanged, i.e. a molecule that is described as a ligand in one circumstance may be described as a target molecule in another circumstance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a single type of ligand is associated with a segment of a nanowire. However, those of skill in the art will recognize that this need not be the case. For example, it may be desirable to associate two (or more) ligands with a single segment of a nanowire in order to achieve a desired result. In the practice of the present invention, ligands may be arranged on the segments of a nanowire in any desired combination or configuration. The segmented nature of the nanowires allows the orderly positioning of ligands via functional groups at defined positions along the wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The attachment or association of a functional group or ligand to the wire, or of a ligand to the wire, and of a ligand to a target molecule may be of any suitable nature. For example, they may be associated via magnetic, covalent, ionic, electrostatic, hydrophobic or hydrophillic interactions or attractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, magnetic manipulation of the nanowires is combined with the well-developed and powerful optical tracking techniques currently in use in biological and other systems. For example, fluorescent or photoluminescent materials may be associated with the nanowires, either by direct incorporation into the nanowire during fabrication, or by attachment to the nanowire after fabrication. For example, zinc oxide or ZnO, can be electrochemically deposited to form photoluminescent nanowire segments. Alternatively, cuprous oxide, Cu<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O can be used to form photoluminescent nanowires which absorb light in the visible region and emit light in the near infrared or IR region, a spectroscopic region useful for many biological applications. Thus, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a variety of photoluminescent materials can be electrodeposited in compositionally modified nanowires to yield materials that have both luminescent and magnetic segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, luminescent chromophores may be bound to nanowires after fabrication. The chromophores may be bound directly to specific segments of a nanowire, (e.g. the chromphores may be capable of reacting with specific segments of the wire, for example, via a functional group). Alternatively, for some purposes it may be desirable to tag nanowires nonspecifically. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the chromophore may not be attached directly to the wire, but rather to a ligand or to a linking molecule (e.g. an alkyl chain or other polymeric chain) so that the chromophore is positioned away from the surface of the wire. A wide variety of luminescent chromophores with appropriate chemical compositions are known and commercially available, and the relevant methods of detection are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, see the World Wide Web site of Molecular Probes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Because the multifunctional nanowires of the present invention are magnetic, they can readily be manipulated and/or retrieved by straightforward methods which are well-known to those of skill in the art, such as the application of magnetic fields. Examples include but are not limited to the application of a non-uniform magnetic field. This may be accomplished with, for example, external magnets or magnetic tweezers, or with more localized field sources such as lithographically patterned magnetic structures, microfabricated circuits, or even with other nanowires. Further, the location of magnetic nanowires may also be readily detected and monitored by methods which are well-known to those of skill in the art, including via visual observation. Further, if the wires have been functionalized with a fluorescent tag or label, spectroscopically based detection means can also be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Multifunctional magnetic nanowires have many potential applications in biological systems. Most basically, because the wires are multifunctional, they may be utilized in any system in which it is desirable to utilize a substrate capable of presenting multiple ligands, and/or in which it would be desirable to have the ability to orient and/or retrieve the substrate after the ligand has bound to a target molecule, or to magnetically detect the location of the substrate after the ligand has bound to a target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> For example, the multifunctional nanowires may be utilized to simultaneously bind and detect a plurality of target molecules in a biological sample, the number being limited only by the number of differentially functionalized segments on the wire. Examples of target molecules which can be detected in this manner include but are not limited to proteins and peptides, nucleic acids, lipids and saccharides. Any molecule or macromolecule capable of being bound by a ligand that can be attached to a magnetic nanowire of the present invention may be detected by the practice of the methods of the present invention. Further, the binding may be either specific or non-specific. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are many applications for such a tool. For example, the wires may be utilized to simultaneously detect the presence of or to measure multiple compounds present in biological samples such as blood, plasma, urine, semen, saliva, stool samples, swabs (vaginal, oral, etc.), cells (such as mammalian and plant cells), cellular or subcellular extracts, viruses, water samples, and the like. Target molecules that may be detected included drugs, hormones, proteins (e.g. antibodies, antigens, enzymes, etc.), peptides, nucleic acids (e.g. DNA and RNA), carbohydrates, metals, pollutants, and the like. Further, such a tool may be utilized in various assay systems such as for assays of enzymes and substrates (e.g. fluorescence and radio immunoasays) and in nucleic acid hybridization assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In addition, the magnetic nanowires may be used for affinity purification of target molecules. For example, one member of a ligand-target molecule binding pair (e.g. antibody/antigen, enzyme/substrate, ligand-receptor, and the like) may be attached to the wire in order to sequester and remove the other member of the binding pair from a sample. The multifunctionality of the nanowires of the present invention is a boon in this application since more than one target molecule can be sequestered and retrieved. This aspect of the invention may be used to obtain desired molecules from a mixture, or to remove unwanted molecule from a mixture e.g. to remove unwanted protein components from antisera or clinical samples, to sequester or remove anti-self antibodies. Because the substances which are bound to the wires are held in place by the wires, the substances may be conveniently washed to remove extraneous matter, and/or transferred to a desired location (e.g. to an assay container). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The target molecule need not be free in solution but may be attached to or embedded in a biological structure such as a cell, subcellular organelle or tissue. Thus, one segment of a functionalized nanowire may serve to target the entire wire to a cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Potential applications for this aspect of the invention include but are not limited to: the detection of cell surface receptors; localization/bifunctional capture of multiple cells; transport of a ligand of interest to a targeted cell via binding of a ligand on the wire to a target molecule on the cell surface; study of the motion of cells with associated nanowires; determining abundance of the cells with bound wires by measuring the local field created by the wires; retrieval and thus separation of cells with bound nanowires, including selection of desired cell types or purging of unwanted cell types (because the cells which are bound to the wires are held in place by the wires, they may be conveniently washed to remove extraneous matter and transferred to a desired location); application of a magnetic field to a cell-bound wire to twist the wire and damage or kill the cell; application of an electric current to disrupt the transmembrane potential of the cell, therefore permeabilizing the cell membrane in order to introduce other molecules (e.g. nucleic acids) into the cell; use of a strong current to kill the targeted cell; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, with bi-functionalized wires, one functional group could be used to localize wires to specific anatomical structures inside a cell, and a second to, for example, probe the presence of a relevant protein at that location, sample internal cell compartments, to assess the mechanical and Theological properties of sub-cellular species, or to deliver a substance of interest to that location. Alternatively, if a segment of a nanowire is functionalized with a non-adhesive substance that prevents binding of that segment to a cell, such as ethylene glycol, and the remaining segment with a ligand for a cell-surface receptor, then cells will be able to bind only part of the nanowire. The unbound segment would prevent internalization of these wires; thus, the wires of the present invention would then be permanently held on the outside of the cell surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, nanowires can be made into artificial, magnetic antibodies by functionalizing one segment with a ligand to bind to a specified target molecule, and the other end with a ligand that acts as a beacon to attract immune cells. In this manner, the wires may be used to present stimulartory or co-stimulatory signal to T-cells which induce clonal expansion of T cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The location of magnetic nanowires may be detected, either directly by detecting the magnetic fields of the wires, or by detection of a labeled (e.g fluorescent, or photoluminescent) segment of the wire. Luminescent and fluorescent and other optically active materials may be used, for examples, to fabricate nanowires with unique &ldquo;optical bar-coding&rdquo; for the simultaneous tracking of multiple biological targets. For example, a unique combination of fluorescent and non-fluorescent nanowire segments can be fabricated and assigned a particular optical pattern or bar-code to distinguish the nanowire from other nanowires within a biological or other system. A unique optical pattern or barcode can be applied to a segment of a nanowire functionalized with a particular ligand or designed to bind to a particular target molecule or target molecules. When the nanowire encoded with an optical pattern or barcode is introduced into a biological or other system, it can be located and tracked using a variety of magnetic or optical detection devices. For example, a magnetic nanowire bound to a cell can be used to track the movement of a cell in a biological fluid (e.g., blood, serum, lymph, semen, vaginal fluid). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, a particular cell or cell type can be optically or magnetically &ldquo;tagged&rdquo; with a nanowire. The movement of the cell-bound exemplary nanowire can then be tracked within a fluid system (e.g., the body of a human, animal or plant). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, nanowires are used as biosensors to detect the presence of and quantitate target molecules. There are many potential applications that use microfabricated magnetic field probes to detect the presence and location of small magnetic entities. For example, cells or molecules bound to nanowires with magnetic segments can be selectively bound to specific regions of a surface. By measuring the local fields produced by the magnetic entities in those regions, the location and/or abundance of the cells or molecules of interest can be determined. Alternatively, motion of individual cells with magnetic entities bound to them can be detected by local field probes. Detection of magnetic nanowires with local field probes is yet another alternative to the optical tracking and detection mechanisms described above. Microfabricated field probes can also provide a means to link biological systems to integrated circuit technology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, tunable magnetic properties and chemical multifunctionality of nanowires are combined in a variety of ways to form one-, two- and three-dimensional nanoscale structures. Multisegmented magnetic nanowires can be manipulated in an external magnetic field to form such structures by taking advantage of the multifunctionality of the nanowires. One strategy is to use one segment of the nanowire as a binding site for a ligand that will also bind to a corresponding segment in another nanowire. For example, short-chain dithiols can be used to link gold segments in multicomponent nanowires. In one embodiment of the invention, controlled assembly of individual nanowires can be induced by functionalizing the non-linking segments of the nanowires with charged tail groups. The electrostatic forces between these segments can be used to control the angle at which two nanowires are attached. This approach can be used to produce ordered and disordered arrays with different dimensionality depending on the functionalization of the wires. Further control can be achieved by combining electrostatic and magnetic interactions. The electrostatic forces between two nanowires with charged monolayers can be significantly larger than the magnetic forces between the same wires. However, the range of the electrostatic interactions can be tuned by changing the ion concentration, which controls the screening length. Complex arrangements of nanowires can thus be achieved by using the long-range magnetic forces to bring wires into proximity. The precise nature of the interactions of the nanowires can be determined by the distribution of the charged segments on the wires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> This approach is of interest, for example, for tissue engineering and in the design of self-healing structures. For example, nanowire structures may function as scaffoldings or templates for cell growth or for the implantation of cells. A cell of interest (for example, a cardiac cell) may be attached to and/or grown on single nanowires. The attachment may be specific (e.g. via a ligand on the wire binding to a target molecule on the cell), or non-specific by introducing nanowires into a cell culture substrate (e.g. culturing the nanowires with the cells and allowing the cells to grow on the wires). Alternatively, the nanowires may be assembled into the desired structure prior to the attachment of the cells, and the cells allowed to attach to and grow on the structure. The open nature of these exemplary structures will allow easy diffusion of nutrients through the assembled nanowire network. As such, the structures will provide superior substrates for, for example, the culture of cells compared to typical two-dimensional culturing techniques (e.g. on the flat surface of a Petri dish). The structures can provide scaffolding for cells grown in liquid culture. It is well known that cells (e.g. cardiac cells) grown on supportive three-dimensional scaffolding such as threads of suture material exhibit characteristics more like that of heart tissue than those grown on flat surfaces. The nanowires of the present invention provide such supportive scaffolding with the added benefit of ready manipulation and retrieval of the structures, and the ability to monitor the location of the structures, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, such structures with attached cells could be used in the transplantation of cultured cells into a an organism of interest. For example, tissue which had been cultured in vitro could be introduced into an organism. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Nickel Nanowire Fabrication. Nickel nanowires were fabricated by electrochemical deposition into commercially available 50 &mgr;m thick alumina filter templates (Anodisck, Whatman, Inc.) with a nominal minimum pore diameter of 100 nm. A gold film was sputter-deposited on one side of the template to serve as a working electrode. Nickel was deposited from a solution of 20 g L<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>NiCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.6H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, 515 g L<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>Ni(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NSO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.4H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, and 20 g L<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>BO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, buffered to pH 3.4 at a potential of &minus;1.0 V (Ag/AgCl). The wires were grown to be 5-25 &mgr;m in length as controlled by the deposition time. The nanowires&apos; average radius was a&equals;0.18 &plusmn;0.02 &mgr;m, as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The wires are therefore nanometers in diameter and microns in length. The nanowires were removed from the templates by dissolving the alumina in 0.5 M KOH at T&equals;50&deg; C. for 24 h, stirring occasionally. The wires were collected by entrifuging at 7000 rpm for 10 min, or by placing a small magnet on the side of the flask. This latter magnetic collection procedure exposed the wires to a field in excess of 1 kG and permanently magnetized the wires with their magnetic moments parallel to their long axis. With both procedures, the supernatant was decanted and the wires were resuspended by sonication in 1.5 mL of absolute ethanol. This collection and rinsing procedure was repeated twice with fresh ethanol or other solvents of interest and the supernatant was generally stored in these solvents in air. Aggregation and settling of the wires was observed under a variety of conditions, and brief sonication (&tilde;5 s, 42 kHz, Cole-Parmer model 8890) consistently resulted in redispersion of the wires, regardless of their remnant magnetization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Nanowires suspended in low viscosity liquids such as water, ethanol, and 2-propanol precipitate from the solutions in the course of several minutes. In addition, aggregation occurs due to interwire magnetic forces. To minimize aggregation and precipitation, the nanowires were suspended in more viscous media such as 1:1 hexadecane (C<highlight><subscript>16</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>34</subscript></highlight>)/octadecane (C<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>38</subscript></highlight>) mixtures or ethylene glycol in order to increase stability. For example, in hexadecane/octadecane the nanowires remain suspended for period of days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Gold-Nickel Nanowire Fabrication To make Au-Ni nanowires, Ni segments were grown as described above. The Ni solution was then removed from the deposition cell and replaced with a commercially available Au-plating solution (Technic 495). Further electrodeposition resulted in Au segments growing on the Ni segments to form two-segment nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Functionalization of Nanowires with Porphyrin. To functionalize magnetic nanowires with fluorescent porphyrins, Hematoporphyrin IX, &lsqb;8, 13-bis(1-hydroxyethyl)-3,7,12,17-tetramethyl-21H, 23H-porphine-2,18-dipropionic acid&rsqb; was employed. Hematoporphyrin IX has two intense, red fluorescence bands (&lgr;<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&equals;626 and 696 nm in ethanol) and two carboxylic acid groups that are known to bind strongly to metal oxides and to the native oxide films on metals, such as nickel. Approximately one million 10 &mgr;m-long Ni nanowires were fabricated as described, placed in 20 mL of a 10 mM hematoporphyrin IX ethanol solution, and allowed to react at room temperature for 1 hour. The wires were then collected by placing a magnet outside of the reaction flask, the solution was decanted, and the wires were rinsed with excess ethanol until no fluorescence was observed from the supernatant solution. Typically, between two and four iterations were required before the supernatant was nonemissive. The wires were then re-suspended in a 1:1 hexadecane-octadecane solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Cell Culture. HeLa human epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco&apos;s modified Eagles&apos; medium (DMEM) containing Na-pyruvate and L-glutamine as supplied, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast cell were cultured in DMEM as above, supplemented with 5% calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Attachment of Nanowires to Cells. Cells grown on either glass coverslips or on plastic culture dishes were exposed to solutions of functionalized nanowires (approximately 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>nanowires per ml). The nanowires are allowed to settle on the cells, and the cell/nanowire mixture is then incubated for periods of one to twelve hours. Wires that do not bind to the cells may be washed away by gentle rinsing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Porphyrins are an important class of macrocycles that regulate many biological processes such as the transport and activation of dioxygen. Free-base porphyrins display intense fluorescence and are readily derivatized with functional groups that bind tenaciously to solid-state surfaces, but do not affect the fluorescent properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Nickel nanowires were reacted with hematoporphyrin IX as described. Fluouresence images of the wires after reaction (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) demonstrate that the nickel wires display the characteristic fluorescence of hematoporphyrin IX, while the solution itself is non-fluorescent. Control experiments with porphyrins lacking terminal functional groups did not bind to the wires under the same conditions (data not shown). The control experiment suggests that binding occurs through the carboxylic acid groups on the hematoporphyrin IX to the native oxide film on the nickel surface. This experiment demonstrates that the hematoporphyrin IX binds to nickel nanowires and that nanowires with bound hematoporphyrin IX may be readily visualized. </paragraph>

The wires were placed in a 20 mL ethanol solution containing 20 mM octane thiol (capable of interacting with Au) and 10 mM hematoporphyrin IX (capable of interacting with the oxide film of the Ni portion of the wire). The wires were allowed to react at room temperature for 1 hour. The wires were then collected by placing a magnetic stir bar outside of the reaction flask and decanting the solution.

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Interaction Between Nanowires and Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Experiments were conducted in which the tendancy of magnetic nanowires to adhere to living cells was investigated. HeLa cells were exposed to bare Ni wires, or to Ni wires that had been coated with either 11-aminoundecanoic acid or rat-tail collagen. Typical results are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. The amine termination of 11-aminoundecanoic acid has a general, non-specific affinity for cells, and rat-tail collagen is known in the art to promote cell-surface adhesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Bare Ni wires showed no tendency to adhere to the HeLa cells (not shown). However, as can be seen, both the 11-Aminoundecanoic acid and collagen coated wires adhered strongly to the cells. In fact, the cells displayed a tendency to internalize the wires. An important observation was that the wires do not appear to be toxic to the cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The strong adherence of the nanowires to the cells was confirmed by the manipulation of the cells with bound wires using magnetic fields. For example, cells with a bound magnetic wire were rotated in place by the torque produced on the nanowire&apos;s magnetic moment by an external magnetic field (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Further observations showed that the binding of a nanowire to a cell influences the cell&apos;s orientation on a substrate. As cells with a bound nanowire spread on a flat surface, they did so asymetrically with their long axis parallel to the bound nanowire, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A and B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates that while bare nanowires did not attach to living cells, nanowires coated with substances known to promote adhesion to cells did so. In some cases, the nanowires were internalized by the cells, yet the wires were non-toxic. Further, the position of the cells with bound nanowires could be manipulated using an external magnetic field. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Alignment and Self-Assembly of Nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Fluorescent and non-fluorescent nanowires functionalized with fluorescent porphyrins and suspended in fluid solution can be oriented and assembled with magnetic fields. Self-assembly of the nanowires from suspension is achieved by allowing the wires to settle onto flat, glass substrates. The magnetized nanowires interact with each other through dipolar forces, and tend to aggregate. This occurs both during settling and on the substrates, where they remain mobile for periods of up to hours. If the nanowires are initially randomly oriented in the fluid, then this process yields random collections of nanowires, due to the dependence of the dipolar interaction between pairs of nanowires on their relative orientation. However, controlled assembly may be achieved by applying a small external field H&lt;10 G. By pre-aligning the suspended nanowires, this field suppresses the tendency towards random aggregation, and leads to the formation of extended head-to-tail nanowire chains. These chains can become quite long, ultimately extending over hundreds of microns on the substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The morphology of the chains is governed by the external field strength. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A-C, for Ni nanowires, at higher fields the chains become progressively straighter (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>) and the tendency to form multiple branches seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference> is eliminated. These chains are stable when the field is removed, and retain their shape when the solvent is evaporated slowly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Experiments on chain formation with three component nanowires, with non-magnetic Au ends and a central magnetic Ni segment, were also carried out The results showed that the three component nanowires form overlapping chains so as to bring the ends of the magnetic segments of adjacent wires in the closest possible proximity (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates that self-assembled structures of nanowires with controlled morphology may be formed and has application in providing scaffolds for tissue engineering. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The dynamics of chain formation were studied via video microscopy. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows four video frames (a-d) from the joining of two short chains composed of two and three nanowires, respectively, carried out in ethylene glycol at T&equals;20&deg; C. and H&equals;4 G. From these data, the chains&apos; locations can be determined for each frame, and the end-to-end separation vs. time r(t) for the event in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is shown in as Trace <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference>. The large circles indicate the data points corresponding to the frames in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> also shows data for a second event in ethylene glycol (Trace <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), along with two events observed in water at T&equals;35&deg; C. (Traces <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The separation vs time curves are qualitatively similar for all joining events, but the significantly higher viscosity of ethylene glycol results in a much slower motion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The force F between both single nanowires and nanowire chains can be modeled very accurately by treating them as extended magnetic dipoles. Their hydrodynamics is dominated by viscous drag effects, and hence a wire or chain&apos;s velocity is v&equals;F/D, where D is the appropriate drag coefficient. Integrating this equation of motion yields the solid lines for r(t) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, and provides a very accurate description of the chain formation dynamics for a wide range of chain lengths and fluid viscosities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The quantitative understanding of the dynamics of the nanowires&apos; interactions demonstrated in this example has applications in the design of nanowires with specific behavior and response to both locally applied and external magnetic fields for use in any of the applications and devices described herein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The efficacy of magnetic separation using magnetic nanowires was demonstrated as follows. NIH 3T3 cells cultured as described above were exposed to single-segment, umnagnetized Ni nanowires functionalized with rat-tail collagen, and incubated overnight. The wire concentration was chosen such that approximately 50% of the cells had one or more wires bound to them. The cells were than detached from the dishes by exposure to trypsin following standard techniques. Two-ml aliquots of the cells in suspension were placed in 10-ml plastic centrifuge cuvettes. The cuvettes were then brought in close proximity to a pair of small rear-earth permanent magnets for 5 minutes. The magnets were oriented with their poles anti-aligned to maximize the magnetic field gradient and hence the force on the nanowires, which become magnetized as well by exposure to this field. Visible clumps of wires and cells can be observed collecting near the pole faces of the magnets. The supernatant was then removed by pipetting and collected in a culture dish. This dish contained a large number of cells, of which less than 5% were bound to nanowires. Meanwhile, fresh medium was placed in the cuvette, and the magnets removed, which allowed the cells that had been immobilized to be collected. Of these, over 95% were found to be bound to one or more nanowires. This example demonstrates that cells bound to magnetic nanowires can be separated from cells that are not so bound. </paragraph>

In this process, which is illustrated schematically in FIG. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, magnetic nanowires <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in a fluid suspension are allowed to settle onto a substrate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that contains lithographically patterned magnetic features <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>.

The trapping process can be tuned by varying the concentration of nanowires in suspension and by applying an external magnetic field.

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates that magnetic nanowires can be directed to specific locations on a substrate or on the surface of an integrated circuit chip by localized magnetic fields produced by features, structures, or devices on that substrate or chip.

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The ability to use magnetic trapping of nanowires to bring cells to specific locations on a substrate was demonstrated as follows. Ni nanowires, 20 microns long and 300 nm in diameter, were functionalized with rat-tail collagen, and bound to NIH 3T3 cells, as described in Example 7. The cells were detached from the surface on which they had been cultured by exposure to trypsin, and suspended in fresh culture medium. These cells were magnetically separated as described in example 7. The cells containing magnetic nanowires were then allowed to settle onto a glass substrate with pairs of 8&times;80 micron magnetized Ni ovals. After settling, some of these cells are attracted into the gaps between ovals by the ovals&apos; magnetic fields, where they become trapped by the magnetic forces between the ovals and the nanowires to which they are bound. This demonstrates the ability to manipulate the locations of individual cells using magnetic nanowires. This technique could be used to bring cells into contact with microelectronic circuits at specific locations in controlled ways. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Attractive lawns are considered an asset by homeowners and owners of commercial recreational establishments, such as theme parks and golf courses. Typically, such lawns require treatment with a number of chemicals, including fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. Unfortunately, until the lawn begins to show obvious symptoms of a nutritional deficiency or infestation with weeds or pests, there is no way to determine when application of such chemicals is appropriate or warranted. Accordingly, there is often extensive and unnecessary usage of such compounds. Excessive treatment with these chemicals is expensive and environmentally compromising. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The maintenance of attractive lawns also requires application of water at appropriate times. If watering is delayed too long, leaf browning and leaf loss can occur. In addition, plants may die from draught stress. Watering too often can also result in plant damage. Moreover, frequent watering is expensive and poses serious problems in areas with water shortage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Attempts have been made to overcome these problems by developing more resistant grasses that require less fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides. However, there currently are no systems available which permit application of fertilizers, pesticides and water to select areas that need such treatment. Accordingly, it is desirable to have grass plants which are capable of visually communicating their need for fertilizers, chemicals or water to the observer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides transgenic grass plants which exhibit a color different from the color exhibited by the corresponding non-transgenic grass plants under conditions of stress. Examples of such conditions include, but are not limited to, lack of fertilizer, lack of water, and attack by insects or pathogens. The genome of the present transgenic grass plant comprise a transgene comprising a nucleic acid which encodes one or more regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis, hereinafter referred to as an &ldquo;anthocyanin regulatory gene&rdquo;, and an inducible promoter which is responsive to a stress condition, such as for example, nutrient deprivation, water deprivation, and attack by a pathogen. The promoter, which is hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;stress&rdquo; inducible promoter, is operably linked to the anthocyanin regulatory gene. Expression of the anthocyanin regulatory gene, in response to the stress condition, provides a gene product which activates expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and results in the transgenic grass plant having a different color phenotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a construct and vector for preparing the transgenic grass. The construct and vector comprise a transgene comprising an anthocyanin regulatory gene operably linked to a stress inducible promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a transgenic grass plant which constitutively exhibits a different color phenotype, particularly a red color phenotype. The genome the transgenic grass plant comprises a transgene comprising an exogenous anthocyanin regulatory gene operably linked to a constitutive promoter. Grass plants that constitutively display a colored phenotype are useful for display and decorative purposes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Definitions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Promoter, as used herein, refers to a recognition site on a DNA molecule that provide an expression control element for a gene and which allows the recruitment of RNA polymerase to initiate RNA synthesis (transcription) of the gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Regeneration, as used herein, refers to the process of growing a plant from a plant cell (e.g., plant protoplast, plant calli or plant explant). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Transformation, as used herein, refers to a process of introducing an exogenous DNA molecule (e g., a vector, a recombinant DNA molecule) into a cell, a callus, or protoplast in which that exogenous DNA is incorporated into a chromosome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Transformed Cell, as used herein, refers to a cell whose DNA has been altered by the introduction of an exogenous DNA molecule into that cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Transgene, as used herein, refers to an exogenous gene which when introduced into the genome of a host cell through a process such as transformation, electroporation, particle bombardment, and the like, is expressed by the host cell and integrated into the cells genome such that the trait or traits produced by the expression of the transgene is inherited by the progeny of the transformed cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Transgenic Cell, as used herein, refers to any cell derived or regenerated from a transformed cell or derived from a transgenic cell. Exemplary transgenic cells include plant calli derived from a transformed plant cell and particular cells such as leaf, root, stem, e.g., somatic cells, or reproductive (germ) cells obtained from a transgenic plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Transgenic Plant, as used herein, refers to a plant or progeny thereof derived from a transformed plant cell or protoplast, wherein the plant DNA contains an introduced exogenous DNA molecule not originally present in a native, non-transgenic plant of the same strain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Vector, as used herein, refers to a DNA molecule capable of replication in a host cell and/or to which another DNA segment can be operatively linked so as to bring about replication of the attached segment. A plasmid is an exemplary vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides a nucleic acid construct comprising a transgene which comprises one or more anthocyanin regulatory genes and a stress inducible promoter which induces transcription of the anthocyanin regulatory gene in response to a stress condition. The promoter is operably linked to the anthocyanin regulatory gene or genes. The anthocyanin regulatory gene may be derived from a grass plant or from a plant other than grass. In one embodiment the, anthocyanin regulatory genes are derived from maize. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a transgenic grass plant whose genome comprises a transgene comprising an exogenous anthocyanin regulatory gene and a promoter which is operably linked to the anthocyanin regulatory gene. In one embodiment, the promoter is a stress inducible promoter i.e., a promoter which induces expression of the anthocyanin regulatory gene in response to a stress condition such as for example, drought conditions, lack of fertilizer, or attack by a pathogen. In another embodiment, the promoter is a chemical inducible promoter, which induces expression of the anthocyanin regulatory gene in response to exposure of the plant to the chemical. In yet another embodiment, the promoter is a constitutive promoter which continuously drives expression of the anthocyanin regulatory gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Nucleic Acid Construct </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A. Anthocyanin Regulatory and Biosynthetic Genes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Anthocyanins are non-toxic pigments that are responsible for many of the red and blue colors in plants. These pigments function to attract pollinating insects to plants and shield plant DNA from ultraviolet light damage. There are multiple anthocyanin genes producing pigments that cause plants to display different colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In corn or maize, anthocyanin biosynthesis requires expression of 20 or more genes. Some of these genes are anthocyanin biosynthetic genes; others are anthocyanin regulatory genes. An anthocyanin biosynthetic gene is a gene whose product is an enzyme that is involved in the biosynthesis of the anthocyanins. Examples of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes or loci in maize include C2, Whp, A1, CHI. A2, Bz1, and Bz2. In maize, there are at least 6 anthocyanin regulatory genes or loci, R, B, C1, P1, P and P, whose products are regulatory proteins which activate the transcription of one or more anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although the genetic pathways for anthocyanin synthesis are complex, there is some understanding of regulation of anthocyanin synthesis. Two of the better understood protein factors known to activate expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in maize are C1, which is a homologue of the mammalian transcription factor myb, and R, a group of factors that contain helix-loop-helix domains in their proteins. C1 and R proteins act together to increase expression of the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes by binding to their promoter regions and activating their transcription. Expressing the C1/R transcription factors in transgenic maize cell lines stimulates expression of genes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, resulting in the accumulation of the anthocyanins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The R locus encompasses a gene family (in maize, located on chromosome 10) comprising at least three different genes; i.e., R (which itself may comprise duplicate genes organized in a tandem array), and the displaced duplicate genes R(Lc) and R(Sn). R typically conditions pigmentation of the aleurone (i.e., outer layer of a seed) but various alleles are known to confer distinct patterns of pigmentation. R(Lc) is associated with unique pigmentation of leaves and R(Sn) with unique pigmentation of the scutellar node. One state of R is associated with pigmentation of the whole plant (R(P)), while another is associated with pigmentation of the seeds (R(S)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Alleles of the C1 locus of particular interest are C1 (Paz-Ares et. al., EMBO J. 6:3553-3558, 1987) and C1-S (Schleffer et. al., Mol.Gen.Genet. 242:40-48, 1994). Analysis of the sequences revealed the presence of two introns in the coding region of the gene. The protein encoded by the C1 and C1-S alleles shares homology with myb proto-oncogenes and is known to be a nuclear protein with DNA-binding capacity acting as a transcriptional activator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, applicants have shown that expression of exogenous C1/R transcription factors in grass plants activates expression of endogenous anthocyanin biosynthesis genes that are present in the genome of the grass plants but that are not normally expressed. As a result of the expression of the &ldquo;normally-silent&rdquo; endogenous anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, the transformed grass plants express a red color phenotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the DNA construct of the present invention comprises a maize anthocyanin regulatory gene which, preferably, is selected from the group consisting of the R gene, the C1 gene, and combinations thereof. A construct which comprises both the R and C1 genes, herein called &ldquo;C1/R&rdquo;, is described in articles by Grotewold et. al. (Cell 76: 543-553, 1994; Plant Cell 10:721-740, 1998), which are specifically incorporated herein by reference. The C1 and R genes encode proteins that interact with each other, bind to the promoters of anthocyanin structural genes and thereby activate transcription of the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. The nucleotide sequence of various C1 and R, genes are available in Genbank and other references, such as for example, Paz-Ares et. al., EMBO J. 6:3553-3558, 1987. In another embodiment, the anthocyanin regulatory gene encodes a chimeric protein referred to hereinafter as the &ldquo;CRC&rdquo; protein. The CRC protein provides a convenient artificial single-gene regulator of anthocyanin accumulation. The CRC protein is formed by a translational fusion of the Myb domain of C1 (C), the complete R protein (R), followed by the C-terminal region of C1 (C).(see, Bruce, W. et al. (2000) Expression profiling of the maize flavonoid pathway genes controlled by estradiol-inducible transcription factors CFC and P. Plant Cell 12: 65-79). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> B. Promoters </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The transgene further comprises a promoter which is operably linked to the coding sequence of the anthocyanin regulatory gene for expression of the coding sequence. Preferably, the promoter is upstream of the anthocyanin regulatory gene or genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the promoter is a stress inducible promoter that responds to a stress condition such as drought or infection with a pathogen. Promoters that respond to drought include the promoter of the maize rab28 gene as described in Pla et. al., Plant Mol. Biol. 21:259-266, 1993, the promoter of the maize rab17 gene as described in Busk et. al., Plant J. 11:1285-1295, 1997, and the promoter of the maize Ivr2 gene, as described in Pelleschi et. al., Plant Mol. Biol. 39:373-380, 1999. One example of a promoter that responds to pathogens is the promoter of the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (Garcia-Muniz et. al., Plant Mol. Biol. 38:623-632, 1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the promoter is a chemical inducible promoter that induces expression of the anthocyanin regulatory gene in response to contact of the transgenic plant with a chemical. Several promoters inducible by chemicals are available in plants (See, Gatz and Lenk I. (1998) Promoters that respond to chemical inducers. Trends Plant Sci. 3: 352-358). Suitable examples include, but are not limited to, steroid-inducible promoters (See, Lloyd et al. (1994) Epidermal cell fate determination in Arabadopsis: Patterns defined by a steroid inducible regulator. Science 266: 436-439.) and estradiol inducible promoters (See, Bruce, W. et al. (2000) Expression profiling of the maize flavonoid pathway genes controlled by estradiol-inducible transcription factors CFC and P. Plant Cell 12: 65-79). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the promoter is a constitutive promoter such as for example, the 35S cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter or a nopaline synthase or octopine synthase promoter. Examples of other constitutive promoters used in plants are the 19 S promoter, and promoters from genes encoding actin or ubiquitin. The promoters may be obtained from genomic DNA by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then cloned into the construct. Standard recombinant DNA and molecular cloning techniques used here are well known in the art and are described by J. Sambrook, E. F. Fritsch and T. Maniatis, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989) and by T. J. Silhavy, M. L. Berman, and L. W. Enquist, Experiments with Gene Fusions, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1984). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In addition to the transgene, the DNA construct, preferably, also comprises other appropriate regulatory signals, such as a leader sequence, transcription terminator, and polyadenylation site. Such regulatory signals are readily available in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> C. Transcriptional Terminators </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A variety of transcriptional terminators are available for use in expression cassettes. These are responsible for the termination of transcription beyond the transgene and its correct polyadenylation. Appropriate transcriptional terminators and those which are known to function in plants include the CaMV 35S terminator, the tml terminator, the nopaline synthase terminator and the pea rbcS E9 terminator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> D. Sequences for the Enhancement or Regulation of Expression </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Numerous sequences have been found to enhance gene expression from within the transcriptional unit and these sequences can be used in conjunction with the genes of this invention to increase their expression in transgenic plants. Various intron sequences have been shown to enhance expression, particularly in monocotyledonous plants. For example, the introns of the maize Adh1 gene have been found to significantly enhance the expression of the wild-type gene under control of its cognate promoter when introduced into maize cells. Intron 1 was found to be particularly effective and enhanced expression in fusion constructs with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (Callis et. al., Genes Develop. 1:1183-1200, 1987). In the same experimental system, the intron from the maize bronze 1 gene had a similar effect in enhancing expression (Callis et al., supra). Intron sequences have been routinely incorporated into plant transformation vectors, typically within the non-translated leader. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A number of non-translated leader sequences, derived from viruses, are also known to enhance expression. Specifically, leader sequences from Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV, the &ldquo;omegasequence&rdquo;), Maize Chlorotic Mottle Virus (MCMV), and Alfalfa Mosaic Virus (AlMV) have been shown to be effective in enhancing expression (e.g., Gallie et. al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:8693-8711, 1987; Skuzeski et. al., Plant Mol. Biol. 15:65-79, 1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Optional components of the construct include a marker gene, such as for example, a dominant herbicide resistance gene. Other examples of suitable marker genes include the bar gene which codes for phosphinothricin acetyl transferase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the DNA may include partial T-DNA border sequences, typically retained on integrated DNA following a T-DNA insertion event. Alternately, the integrated exogenous DNA may show some truncation of the left end of the T-DNA, or occasionally, of some DNA beyond the left border, as has been observed after transformation with Agrobacterium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The construct (i.e., anthocyanin regulatory gene plus promoter) may be cloned into a vector, such as for example, a plasmid. Vectors suitable for transforming plant cells include, but are not limited to, Ti plasmids from <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>(J. Darnell, H. F. Lodish and D. Baltimore, Molecular Cell Biology, 2nd edition, Scientific American Books, N.Y. (1990)), a plasmid containing a &bgr;-glucuronidase gene and a cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter plus a leader sequence from alfalfa mosaic virus (Sanford et. al., Plant Mol. Biol. 22:751-765, 1993) or a plasmid containing a bar gene cloned downstream from a CaMV 35S promoter and a tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) leader. Other plasmids may additionally contain introns, such as that derived from alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1), or other DNA sequences. The size of the vector is not a limiting factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Transformation of Grasses with the Transgene </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The transgenic grass plant may be derived from any number of turfgrasses, including Tall fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, Perennial ryegrass, Creeping bentgrass, Bermuda grass, and Zoysia grass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Any type or source of plant cells which can serve as a target for transformation by any one or more of the various biological and non-biological delivery mechanisms available in the art can also serve as a target for transformation according to the present invention. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, immature and mature embryos, pollen, protoplasts, suspension culture cells, callus cells, cotyledon or other seed and seedling parts, leaves or leaf pieces, and roots or root pieces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Methods of Transfecting the Plant </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Delivery or introduction of the DNA construct into eukaryotic cells (i.e., transformation), such as the host plant cells, may be accomplished by a variety of techniques available in the art. Such techniques include non-biological mechanisms such as microprojectile bombardment, electroporation, microinjection, induced uptake, and aerosol beam injection, as well as biological methods such as direct DNA uptake, liposomes and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. See, for example, Bilang, et. al., Gene 100:247-250, 1991; Scheid et. al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 228:104-112, 1991; Guerche et. al., Plant Science 52:111-116, 1987; Neuhause et. al., Theor. Appl Genet. 75:30-36, 1987; Klein et. al., Nature 327:70-73 1987; Howell et. al., Science 208:1265, 1980; Horsch et. al., Science 227:1229-1231, 1985; DeBlock et. al., Plant Physiology 91:694-701, 1989; Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, Weissbach and Weissbach, eds., Academic Press, Inc., 1988; and Methods in Plant Molecular Biology, Schuler and Zielinski, eds., Academic Press, Inc., 1989. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,945,050; 5,036,006; and 5,100,792, all to Sanford et. al. Combinations of the above methods may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Transformation of grass host cells, preferably, is achieved using microprojectile bombardment. As used herein &ldquo;microprojectile bombardment&rdquo; is used to refer to the general method of delivering nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA, to a living cell by coating or precipitating the nucleic acids onto a microprojectile, preferably gold particles, and propelling the coated microprojectile into the living cell (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,036,006 issued Jul. 30, 1991 to Sanford et. al.; U.S. Pat. No., 5,302,523, issued Apr. 12, 1994 to Coffee; Vasil et. al., Biotechnology 11:1553-1558, 1993; and Weeks et. al., Plant Physiol. 102:1077-1084, 1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The exact amount of the construct provided to the host cell is not critical and may vary depending on the manner and form in which the component is delivered. If desired, the skilled artisan may routinely vary the amount of construct delivered to determine the optimum level for each using a particular delivery system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The successful delivery of the DNA into the host cell may be preliminarily evaluated by the transient expression of a &ldquo;reporter&rdquo; gene. A reporter gene is a component on the DNA construct introduced into the cell, or a component of a separate DNA construct which is co-introduced into the cell along with the DNA construct comprising the transgene. The property conferred on the transformed cell or tissue by the introduction of the reporter gene is usually easily detectable (e.g., expression of an easily assayable enzyme). &ldquo;Transient expression&rdquo; denotes the expression, often cytoplasmic, of a gene before the gene has been stably integrated into the genome of the treated cells or tissue. For example, commonly used reporter genes are the genes coding for the production of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which confers resistance to the antibiotic chloramphenicol, or the <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>&bgr;-glucuronidase gene (gusA), the products of which can be detected by a histochemical assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Cells that express reporter genes in transient assays may not give rise to cells where the transformed DNA becomes stably integrated into the host cell genome. Selection of cells that express various marker genes, however, does give rise to cells in which the transformed DNA is stably integrated into the host cell genome. Herein, &ldquo;selection&rdquo; means conditions where only cells into which the DNA construct has been delivered will grow and cells in which the DNA construct has not been delivered will not grow. For example, cells stably expressing an introduced neomycin phosphotransferase gene are selected by growth in the drug G418, and cells stably expressing the Bar gene are resistant to the herbicide BASTA. Cells stably expressing an introduced drug resistance gene are selected by growth in the presence of the drug. Shoots or plantlets growing in the presence of the drug or herbicide are presumptively transformed. Confirmation of stable integration of the transformed genes into the genome of the host may later be accomplished by, for example, herbicide treatment of the resulting plants. In addition, later molecular detection of the introduced DNA in the isolated genomic DNA of the plant cells, for example using Southern blotting/hybridization or polymerase chain reaction, may be used to confirm integration of the introduced genes into the genome of the host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Transformed plant host cells are used to regenerate grass plants. In plants, every cell is capable of regenerating into a mature plant and, in addition, contributing to the germ line such that subsequent generations of the plant will contain the transgene. Growth of grass cells and regeneration of the cells into mature plants is common among those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The transgenic plants are then grown and pollinated with either the same transformed strain or with different strains, and the resulting hybrid, having the desired phenotypic characteristic, is identified. Two or more generations may be grown to ensure that the desired phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and inherited and then seeds harvested. Transformed progeny obtained by this method may be distinguished from non-transformed progeny by the presence of the introduced gene(s) and/or accompanying DNA (genotype), or the phenotype conferred. Preferably, transformation of the grass is determined by assaying for expression of the anthocyanin gene pigment. Accumulation of anthocyanins is verified by extracting a small piece of blade tissue with acid methanol and measuring the absorbance of the extract at or around 530 nanometers using a spectrophotometer. Alternatively, the color change may be apparent after visual inspection of the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that transgenic plants having a genome comprising a stress inducible promoter operably linked to one or more anthocyanin regulatory genes, will produce anthocyanin pigments prior to development of any lesion or other stress-related phenotype. Advantageously, this will allow actions, such as application of a pesticide, fertilizer, or water, to be taken before the plant or tissue is irreversibly damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The present invention also encompasses transgenic grasses which constitutively express the anthocyanin color gene product. Such grasses comprise, within their genome, an anthocyanin regulatory gene operably linked to a constitutive promoter. Grasses resulting from expression of a transgene under control of a constitutive promoter are used for decorative purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Applicants have observed that overexpression of maize C1/R genes produces grass plants that are red in color. Since anthocyanins produce colors other than red in plants, overexpression of other exogenous anthocyanin regulatory genes may produce transgenic grass plants which exhibit a color other than red, that is different from the color exhibited by non-transgenic plants. Alternatively, to produce grass plants which exhibit a color other than green or red, the transgenic grass is co-transformed with a transgene comprising a sequence which encodes an exogenous anthocyanin biosynthesis gene, such as for example the cyt b5 gene whose gene product confers blue colors to flowers.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> DNA constructs comprising the CMV 35 S promoter, operably linked to the R gene from maize, the C1 gene from maize, and the reporter gene &bgr;-glucuronidase, were prepared using standard recombinant DNA techniques. All constructs were introduced into leaf sheaths of Tall fescue via particle bombardment with gold particles using a DuPont Biolistic particle delivery system. After bombardment, cells were transferred to fresh medium. Anthocyanin accumulation was observed in leaf sheaths and roots after 48 hours. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Kentucky bluegrass immature embryos (embryonic calli) are transformed with DNA constructs comprising the CMV 35 S promoter, operably linked to the R gene from maize, the C1 gene from maize, and the reporter gene &bgr;-glucuronidase via particle gun bombardment as described above in Example 1. The transformed plant embryo cells are used to generate transgenic grass plants. This is done by mechanically dispersing the transformed cells, such that single cell clones are obtained, and then growing the clones in medium plus the appropriate hormones such that transgenic grass plants develop. Anthocyanin accumulation is either visually observed in the blades of the transgenic grass plant or is detected spectrophotometrically following extraction of anthocyanin from the blade using methanol or both. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Promoter sequences from the rab28 gene are generated by PCR and cloned into a construct comprising the C1/R chimeric regulatory gene. A vector is constructed such that the regulatory gene encoding C1/R is downstream from, and regulated by, the rab28 promoter. The resulting vector is introduced into embryogenic calli suspension cultures of Kentucky bluegrass, Perennial ryegrass or Tall fescue, via particle bombardment. A bialaphos herbicide resistance selectable marker, under the control of a 35 S promoter, is simultaneously introduced into the cells of the cultures. Calli resistant to the herbicide are selected and maintained before transferring to the regeneration medium, from which plantlets are selected. Transformed plantlets are selected, and anthocyanin pigmentation detected under different light intensities before and after treatment with absicic acid, which mimics the drought inducibility of the rab28 promoter. </paragraph>

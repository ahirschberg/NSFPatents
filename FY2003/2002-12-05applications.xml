<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention provides a device and method for wireless material handling systems. The invention further provides an instrumented glove device worn by an operator. A sensory system within the glove device measures the contact force the operator is exerting on either an object to be moved or the material handling system and generates a set of contact signals representing the contact force. The contact signals are transmitted, via a transmitter circuitry, to a controller in another location. The controller receives and processes the signals and generates a set of command signals. The command signals control the speed and mechanical assistance required of an actuator, as a function of the operator contact force, to move the material handling system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to material handling devices. More specifically, this invention is a material handling device that, among other components, includes an instrumented glove worn by an operator and measures the force the operator is imposing on an object and transmits the measured force in a manner to move the object. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Current material handling devices, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,915,673 and 5,865,426 (Kazerooni), include a sensory end-effector held by a human operator, wherein the human operator force on the material handling device is then amplified electronically to drive the manual material handing device. The sensory end-effector that measures the human operator force is physically connected to the material handling device. A signal, representing the human force imposed on the end-effector by the human operator is measured by the force sensor in the end-effector and transmitted to a controller which controls the actuators of the material handling device. The controller causes the material handling device to move the end-effector and load appropriately so that only a pre-programmed small proportion of the load force is supported by the human operator and the remaining force is provided by the actuators of the material handling system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the critical element of the cited prior art is the end-effector. The material handling device of the prior art responds only to the measured force from a force sensor in the end-effector. Thus, the material handling device is moved only by operator contact with the end-effector; it is not moved by operator contact with the load or any other part of the material handling device. The material handling device of this invention does not have any sensory end-effector and allows the operator to move the load by pushing onto any point on the load or onto any point on the material handling system itself. The material handling system of this invention includes an instrumented glove that is always worn by the operator and therefore remains with the operator. The instrumented glove of this invention generates a set of contact signals as a function of the contact force between the glove and the object being manipulated or the material handling device itself. A set of control signals representing the contact force is transmitted in the form of RF signals to a controller so that a command signal is generated. The command signal is sent to an actuator to provide the required assistance to maneuver the material handling device as a function of the force imposed by the operator, so that the operator provides only a small portion of the total force needed to maneuver the material handling device and the object being manipulated by the material handling device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Instrumented glove is an important component of the invention described here. Currently, instrumented gloves are used in various applications. For instance, gloves with actuators that create forces on the fingers according to a set of computer instructions are designed to emulate forces on the wearer&apos;s fingers and thumbs in telerobotics and virtual reality applications. U.S. Pat. No. 5,184,319 (Kramer) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,505 (Burdea et al.) are patents teaching examples of this application of instrumented gloves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another type of instrumented glove device includes sensors that measure kinematics type data (i.e., position, orientation, and posture) of the fingers, thumbs and wrists for various applications. Applications for gloves with embedded sensors measuring kinematics type data include for example: transforming human hand movements into electronic letters and characters, controlling the movement and actions of video characters, providing biofeedback for sports training such as tennis and golf, and assessing the mobility of human and/or animal joints. Examples of transforming human hand movements into electronic letters and characters are taught by, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,414,537 (Grimes) and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,047,952 and 6,035,274 (Kramer et al.). Examples of controlling the movement and actions of video characters are found in the inventions taught by U.S. Pat. No. 5,796,354 (Cartabiano et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,613,139 (Robinson II). U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,530 (Hock) teaches a method and an apparatus with sensors to measure body movement and flexure during kinetic activities. U.S. Pat. No. 4,542,291 (Zimmerman), teaches an optical flex sensor that can be used to detect bending of human movements. U.S. Pat. No. 4,715,235 (Fukui) teaches an electro conductive woven or knitted fabric, which changes its electrical characteristics when stretched and can be used as a switch. And finally, examples of assessing the mobility of human and/or animal joints are taught by, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,444,205 (Jackson) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,986,280 (Marcus et al.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A third type of instrumented glove in the prior art includes glove devices with some sort of sensors to measure the interaction with other objects. Examples include the inventions taught by U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,484 (Prince) describing an apparatus for manually entering information into a computer by generating a virtual keyboard, mouse, graphics tablet or other forms of input data, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,055,905 (Budrose) describing a system that facilitates learning to type. Gloves with sensors to measure the interaction with other objects also include safety and sports training applications, such as taught by, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,016,103 (Leavitt) describing a glove to detect whether or not a motor vehicle driver is sleeping, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,669,809 (Townsend) describing a safety glove to be used in conjunction with a cutting machine, U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,993 (Heitman) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,488,726 (Murray) describing gloves for monitoring human gripping force on a golf club or on an aircraft control stick. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,126,572 (Smith) describes an apparatus for monitoring and displaying information related to pressure exerted at a point of interest during an isometric exercise, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,786 (Klapman) describes a boxing glove capable of measuring impact forces. And finally, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,662,123, 5,449,002, 5,775,332 (Goldman et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,370, (Reinbold et al.) describe capacitive sensor which has a plurality of layers forming a force detector which can be embedded in various patients&apos; shoe, boot, ankle, brace, crutch and handgrip to provide biofeedback to help patients relearn function or prevent atrophy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, prior to the present invention a need remained in the art for a simpler, more versatile device for maneuvering a manual material handling system that requires very little force from the operator and, wherein the operator directs the maneuvering of the material handling device to move an object, by pushing on any point on the material handling device or pushing on the object being maneuvered. Moreover, a system is also further needed to provide assistance for maneuvering the material handling device proportionally based on the force imposed by the operator, so that the operator provides only a small portion of the total force needed to maneuver the material handling device. Nevertheless, no prior art instrumented glove type device is designed for assisting manual material handling systems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The description contained herein relates to a device and method for a material handling system comprising an instrumented glove, a controller and an actuator, that measures the force imposed by wearer of the instrumented glove on the material handling system or an object being manipulated, and provides the required assistance so that the operator provides only a small portion of the total force needed to maneuver the material handling system. This description, however, is intended to be illustrative only and not limiting as to the scope of the present invention. Referring now to the drawings, the details of embodiments of the invention are graphically and schematically illustrated. Like elements in the drawings may be represented by like numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an exemplary embodiment of the instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is worn on the human operator&apos;s hand. Instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of a leather (or cloth) glove <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> with an embedded sensory system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Embedded sensory system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> measures the compressive force exerted by the human operator on an object. Arrow <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> represents the direction of the compressive force that can be measured by instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A contact signal, representing the compressive force, is sent to a transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> via a signal cable <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> transmits a set of control signals (in terms of RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>), representing the contact signal, to a receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> installed in another location. (Receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The received radio frequency waves that are functions of the measured operator force are then used to control other devices. In particular if the instrumented glove measures the operator force on a material handling device or an object being manipulated by the material handling device, the received RF waves can be used to control the material handling device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the instrumented glove on the wearer&apos;s left hand, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that the instrumented glove of the present invention is applicable to either hand. Also note that the instrumented glove described here is not confined to represent ordinary wearable gloves instrumented with force sensors. The terminology &ldquo;instrumented glove&rdquo; is used here to encompass all kinds of gloves, hand pieces, palm, hand and finger covering devices, brace type devices or any type of device that can be connectable and wearable by human hand and measures the human force imposed on an object and transmits RF signals (RF waves) representing the measured force to a receiver located in another location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The term Radio Frequency (RF) refers to the electromagnetic field that is generated when an alternating current is input to an antenna. RF radiation, can be used for wireless broadcasting and communications over a significant portion of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum&mdash;from about 3 kilohertz (kHz) to thousands of gigahertz (GHz). Usually Microwave (MW) radiation is considered a subset of RF radiation, although an alternative convention treats RF and MW radiation as two spectral regions. Microwaves occupy the spectral region between 100 MHz and 300 GHz. As the frequency is increased beyond the RF spectrum, electromagnetic energy takes the form of infrared (IR), visible light, ultraviolet (UV), X rays, and gamma rays. Many types of wireless devices make use of RF fields&mdash;radio, television, cordless and cellular telephones, satellite communication systems, and many measuring and instrumentation systems used in manufacturing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> RF waves (some times referred to as RF signals) have different frequencies, and by tuning a radio receiver to a specific frequency one can pick up a specific signal. In the U.S. the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) decides who is able to use what frequencies for what purposes, and it issues licenses to stations for specific frequencies. All FM radio stations transmit in a band of frequencies between 88 megahertz and 108 megahertz. This band of the radio spectrum is used for no other purpose but FM radio broadcasts. In the same way, AM radio is confined to a band from 535 kilohertz to 1,700 kilohertz. Other common frequency bands include the following: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> For exemplary purposes, a particular application of the present invention is first described. The mechanical and electrical components of the wireless material handling system including the instrumented glove, wireless communication architecture, and control method are then described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A particularly appropriate application for the present invention is the cable car system still in use today in San Francisco, Calif. Cable cars have been used in San Francisco as a transportation means for many years. The principle of the San Francisco cable car operation is simple. Underneath the streets where the cable cars run, a continuously moving cable is pulled in a powerhouse by an electric actuator. Slots in the street, located between the rails on which the cable cars run, provide access to the continuously moving cable. Each cable car is equipped with a grip, which is essentially a strong pair of pliers that extends through the slot to the continuously moving cable. To move the cable car, the conductor pulls a lever inside the cable car, which tightens a grip on the cable and the cable car moves with the continuously moving cable. To stop the cable car, the conductor releases the grip and applies the brakes. The San Francisco cable car system also has several rotating stations. At these rotating stations, the cable cars are placed on large turntables that rotate the cable car so that the cable car is directed back in the opposite direction on the same route. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a rotating station used to rotate cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is first driven onto a set of rails <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that are installed on turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. After engaging the cable car&apos;s brakes, turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotated by an operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> until rails <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are aligned with a set of rails <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> mounted outside of turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Arrow <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> shows the direction of the turntable&apos;s rotation. After alignment of the rails, the cable car brakes are disengaged and cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is driven out of turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> onto street rails <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. This rotation process allows cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to change orientation so that it can go in the opposite direction on the same rails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The turntables of San Francisco are not powered, and therefore, need to be rotated manually by one or two operators. The manual rotation of the San Francisco turntables gives a charming flavor of an older era and attracts millions of tourists. At each rotating station, hundreds of people wait to see the manual rotation of the cable cars by operators. For this reason, it is undesirable to power and automate these turntables. However, although amusing and attractive for passengers and viewers, the manual rotation of the San Francisco cable cars is painful for cable car operators who have to push the cable cars to rotate them. The large forces required to turn the cable car and the turntable have caused cable car operators a great deal of repetitive injuries. Thus, the present invention is ideally suited for this situation. Electric actuators installed under the turntables power the turntables. However, the authenticity of the San Francisco turntables is maintained since no intermediary devices such as, push-buttons, keyboards, or switches are used to operate the actuators. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, where operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is pushing against cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using the instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention, the strenuous efforts required by the operator are significantly decreased. Instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> measures the force operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> imposes on cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and generates contact signals representing the operator force. The contact signals are converted to command signals, which control the actuator used to turn the turntable. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> schematically shows the details of the wireless communication and how the information associated with the operator force is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As shown on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotated by actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. One of ordinary skill in the art would know there are various ways of constructing actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and connecting it to turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example an electric motor could be used in conjunction with a transmission speed reducer to power and rotate turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In locations that electric power is not available, one can use hydraulic or pneumatic actuators. In some simple instances actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> could include a simple clutch that releases energy for rotation of the table. Transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> receives the generated contact signals and transmits a set of control signals via RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through a transmitting antenna (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Turntable controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> located either under the turntable or next to the turntable, receives RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> via a receiving antenna <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (located in turntable controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>) receives RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which represent the operator force. Receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates a set of data as a function of the received RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Using the data generated by receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, turntable controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> calculates an appropriate speed for actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that turns turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This calculated appropriate speed provides enough mechanical strength to assist the operator in the rotating task as required, so that, when operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> pushes on cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> rotates, wherein the operator exerts only a small portion of the total force needed to rotate the turntable. All of this happens so quickly that the operator&apos;s pushing and the turntable turning appear synchronized perfectly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Additionally, since instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is worn by the operator, the operator can push cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by exerting force on any point on the cable car. In this way, the instrumented glove of the present invention replaces intermediary devices such as push buttons, keyboards, and switches to operate turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Similarly, to an observer, the method seems manual since operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is involved in the turning process and actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that rotates turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is under turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and cannot be seen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Thus, the method and device of the present invention including instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, create an assisting system for manual operation of the turntable without any modification to the appearance of the manual operation. This assisting system also reduces the force operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> needs to apply to rotate turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> since actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> generates most of the torque required to rotate the turntable. This reduction in force leads to less fatigue and less risk of injuries for the cable car operators. In general, an instrumented glove in conjunction with a controller and an actuator, as described above, can be used as an assist device to help workers push against various objects and move them with little force in various manufacturing and industrial environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The details of a preferred embodiment of instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, where glove <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is removed for clarity, are shown <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. Sensory system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which is embedded in glove <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> measures the operator&apos;s forces on the environment. Sensory system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a base platform <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> connected (either glued or sewn) to the palm of glove <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Force sensing device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to platform <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> by means of fasteners (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>). Force sensing device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be any kind of sensor that measures the operator force. We have used a strain gage based force sensing device. A strain gage based force sensor includes resistors that are bonded to the material of the force sensor. The force on the force sensor will give rise to the force sensor strain which causes a change in the active length of the resistors and hence their electrical resistance. This change in the electrical resistance of the resistors can then be transformed into a change in voltage via an electric circuitry. The produced voltage is proportional with the applied force. There are a great number of strain gage based sensors in the market. Entran is an example of a company that has been manufacturing variety of strain gage sensors for many years. In should be apparent to one skilled in the art that there are alternative force sensing devices which take advantage of the changes in other electrical properties (e.g. capacitance and inductance) as a function of the applied force. A thin plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is connected to base platform <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> at point <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The top of thin plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is covered with soft material <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, e.g., rubber. As operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, wearing glove <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, pushes against cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>), force sensing device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> measures the contact force and generates contact signals representing the force. The contact signals from force sensing device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are then transmitted to transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which transmits a set of RF waves representing the contact signals to another location for processing and control. Transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is worn by operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> like a watch and receives contact signals via signal cable <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In should be apparent to one skilled in the art that there are alternative locations for the transmitter circuitry, e.g., operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can wear transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on his belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> schematically illustrates the wireless data exchange between transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (integrated with the instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or attached to operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) and receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (integrated in turntable controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). The transmitter circuitry comprises a micro-controller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a transmitter module <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and a transmitting antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. An 8-bit micro-controller manufactured by Motorola (Motorola part no. MC68HC705B16CFN) was used in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention. This particular micro-controller is the most widely used general-purpose 8-bit micro-controller in the US. As would be apparent to those skilled in the art, various alternatives are available, e.g., the TMS320C240 (16 bit digital signal processor) manufactured by Texas Instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The contact signals from sensory system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (part of instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) are first read by analog to digital converter (ADC) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of micro-controller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and then collected into the micro-controller&apos;s memory. Micro-controller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> generates a set of information signals as a function of the collected contact signals. This set of information signals, generated in micro-controller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is then passed to RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> one bit at a time (serial streams) using Serial Communications Interface (SCI) <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> located in micro-controller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The individual bits sent to RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are synchronized to create the desired baud rate. Transmitter module <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> used in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention has a maximum data transfer rate of 50 kbps (kilobauds per second), and therefore dictates the maximum rate at which micro-controller <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can feed RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The available baud rate closest to this maximum is 41,667 bps, and is the rate selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Transmitter module <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> used in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is the HP Series-II transmitter manufactured by Linxc Technologies (Linx Technologies part no. TXM-900-HP-II). The HP Series-II operates in the 902-928 MHz band, and offers simplified integration into wireless product designs. Other features of transmitter module <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are 8 selectable channels and the ability to transmit either analog or digital data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Transmitting antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> functions as a coupling device that allows for transmition of a set of RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as a function of the information signals collected by transmitter module <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Note that RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, transmitted in the air through transmitting antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> represent the contact signals or the operator contact force and can easily be collected by any receiving antenna. For the exemplary embodiment, the transmitting antenna used is the flat &ldquo;Splatch&rdquo; antenna, manufactured by Linx Technologies (Linx part no. ANT-916-SP). The compactness of this transmitting antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> allows it to be concealed within the enclosure of transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, which makes it better suited for portable devices. An alternative is a &ldquo;whip&rdquo; style antenna, which would afford somewhat better performance, but would make the transmitter unit more cumbersome. Additional alternatives for the transmitting antenna <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> would be apparent to one skilled in the art. A battery <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> with proper voltage and current limit is also included in transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to power all components of the transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and embedded sensory system <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Turntable controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> comprises four major components: a receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a power amplifier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a logic circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes an RF receiver module <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a receiving antenna <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Receiver module <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> receives RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> through receiving antenna <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for use by other parts of turntable controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. After detecting, filtering, and amplifying the transmitted RF waves, receiver module <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> makes a set of data available to computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> through the Serial Communications Interface (SCI) <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> feature of computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Receiver module <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (e.g., Linx Technologies part no. RXM-900-HP-II) operates in the same band as the transmitter module <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> (902-928 MHz), separated into <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> selectable channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An analog circuit, a digital circuit, or a computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, with input-output capability and standard peripherals, processes the data received from RF receiver module <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and other various switches (such as emergency stop and start push-buttons), and generates command signals for actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that rotates turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. One skilled in the art would know of any number of analog or digital circuits that could process the data as an alternative to computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. There are many control algorithms that generate command signals as a function of operator contact force. Using the measurement of the operator contact force, computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> calculates the amount of rotation necessary to create enough mechanical strength to assist the operator in the moving task. Refer to allowed patent application Ser. No. 09/443,478 for more details on various control algorithms applicable to the invention described here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Power amplifier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> allows the transfer of power to actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as a function of the command signals from computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. If turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is powered electrically, a power amplifier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (e.g., PWM amplifier or proportional amplifier which receives a constant-voltage electric power from a power supply) is used. Power amplifier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> delivers the proper amount of power to actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> based on the command signals computed within computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Arrow <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> represents the constant voltage to power amplifier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from an external power source and arrow <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> represents the modulated power delivered to actuator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from power amplifier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is powered pneumatically or hydraulically, a pneumatic or a hydraulic servo-valve, which receives pressurized air or fluid from a compressor, is used instead of power amplifier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This pneumatic or hydraulic servo-valve delivers the proper amount of pressurized air or fluid to the actuator based on the command signals computed within computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Finally, logic circuitry <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, composed of electromechanical or solid state relays, start and stop the system depending on a sequence of possible events. For example, the relays are used to start and stop the entire system operation using two push buttons installed either on the controller, on the instrumented glove or somewhere in the vicinity and reach of the operator. The relays also engage a friction brake in the event of power failure or when the operator leaves the system. As would be apparent to one skilled in the art, many alternatives are available for a logic circuit to create safe start-stop operation for the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The control system for rotating the turntable using the present invention is shown on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. The angular velocity of the turntable (&ohgr;) is a function of the command signal generated by computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the human operator force imposed on cable car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This can be demonstrated by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&ohgr;&equals;<highlight><italic>Ge&plus;Sf</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> where (G) is the turntable transfer function which relates the command signal (e) generated by the computer to the angular velocity of the turntable (&ohgr;), and (S) is the turntable sensitivity transfer function which relates the human force (f) to the turntable velocity (&ohgr;). A positive value for (&ohgr;) means clockwise rotation of the turntable. Equation (1) shows that in addition to the command signal (e) from computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, human force (f) that human operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> imposes on turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will also affect the turntable speed. If a closed loop velocity controller is designed for turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such that (S) is small, turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has only a small response to the force human operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> imposes onto turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A high-gain controller in the closed-loop velocity system results in a small (S) and consequently a small change in velocity, (&ohgr;), in response to the human force (f). Also note that non-back drivable speed reducers (usually with high transmission ratios) produce a small (S) for the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Human force, (f), is measured and transmitted to computer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> as described above. If a control algorithm is represented by (K), then the output of the controller (e) is: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>e&equals;K</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Substituting for (e) from equation (2) into equation (1) results in the following equation for the turntable velocity (&ohgr;): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&ohgr;&equals;<highlight><italic>GK</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>)&plus;<highlight><italic>Sf</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Equation (3) shows that the more force imposed on turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the larger the velocity of the turntable. Using the measurement of the operator force, the controller calculates the actuator speed properly to create enough mechanical strength to assist the operator in the rotating task. In this way, turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> follows operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; way. In other words operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is able to rotate turntable <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> more easily without the use of any intermediary device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, human force (f) is a function of human arm dynamics. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> indicates, (K) may not be arbitrarily large. Rather, the choice of (K) must guarantee the closed-loop stability of the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. It would be apparent to one skilled in the art, that there are many methods to design the controller (K). An article entitled &ldquo;A Case Study on Dynamics of Haptic Devices: Human Induced Instability in Powered Hand Controllers,&rdquo; by Kazerooni and Snyder, published in AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, Vol. 18, No. 1, 1995, pp. 108-113, incorporated herein by reference, describes the conditions for the closed loop stability of the system. One skilled in the art is not confined to one choice of controller. A simple low pass filter acting as a controller, in many cases, is adequate to stabilize the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. Some choices of linear or non-linear controllers may lead to a better overall performance (large force amplification and high speed of operation) in the presence of variation of human arm dynamics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The choice of (K) also depends on the available computational power; elaborate control algorithms to stabilize the closed system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> while yielding large force amplification with high speed of maneuvers might require a fast computer and large memory size. An article entitled &ldquo;Human Extenders,&rdquo; by H. Kazerooni and J. Guo, published in ASME Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurements, and Control, Vol. 115, No. 2(B), June 1993, pp. 281-289, incorporated herein by reference, describes stability of the closed loop system and a method of designing (K). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Theoretical values of (G) and (S) are available using standard modeling techniques. There are many experimental frequency-domain and time-domain methods in measuring S and G which yield superior results. In the preferred embodiment, a frequency-domain technique is used in identifying (G) and (S). For example, the book titled &ldquo;Feedback Control of Dynamic Systems,&rdquo; by G. Franklin, D. Powell and A. Emami-Naeini, Addison Wesley, 1991 describes in detail the frequency-domain and time-domain methods for identifying various transfer functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The cable car rotation assistance application discussed above is just one exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The wireless material handing device and method of the present invention may also be used to help operators move various other objects with little human force. Consequently, the various applications of the present invention reduce the manual efforts required by operators and provide a simplified, more versatile material handling device and method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, another application of the present invention is to control a material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is hung from the ceiling or from an overhead crane <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Attached to the end point of the manipulator is an end-effector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which attaches load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, end-effector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> contains two suction cups <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As would be apparent to one skilled in the art, many forms of grippers to connect load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to end-effector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are available in addition to suction cups <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In general, the design of end-effector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> depends on the geometry and weight of load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and how the user wants to connect a load to a particular material-handling device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Instrumented glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> worn by human operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> senses the compressive force that the operator applies to load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> or on material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. As described above, transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> transmits a set of control signals, in the form of RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, representing the measured operator force on any object operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is contacting. Manipulator controller <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> receives RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Similar to turntable controller <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, manipulator controller <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> comprises several major components including receiver circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Using the transmitted RF waves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> from transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, manipulator controller <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> powers the actuators of material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> appropriately such that enough mechanical strength is created to assist operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in the required moving task. Therefore, when operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> pushes load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> moves load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> with an electromechanical force proportional to the actual human force exerted by the operator on the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> However, the contact signals generated by the instrumented glove of the present invention does not specify which direction human operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is pushing on material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the path for material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is programmed in manipulator controller <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is programmed to travel through trajectory <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, e.g., the programmed path may be designed to bring load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> from its current location into a car in an auto assembly plant. As operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> pushes on load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> travels through trajectory <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The more operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> pushes on load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, the faster material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> travels through trajectory <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> follows the particular programmed trajectory regardless of the exact direction in which operator <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> pushes against load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Thus, material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> brings load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to its final destination, moving load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> along a pre-programmed trajectory with a speed that is proportional to the magnitude (but not the exact direction) of the operator&apos;s force on load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> or on material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Therefore, even when the operator is paying little attention to trajectory <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or to the final destination of load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> will still bring load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to the proper final destination. Once load <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is delivered to its final destination, material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> will return to its original location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the embodiments and applications discussed above. For example, while a strain gage force-sensing device <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> was described above, one skilled in the art would know of other force measuring systems such as piezoelectric force sensor that can be used in the instrumented glove to measure the operator force. A piezoelectric force sensor produces electric charges when a force is applied to it. The generated electrical charges are then transformed to voltage via a charge amplifier for measurement. The fundamental difference between these devices and strain gage based force detection devices is that the electrical charges generated by the crystal decays rapidly after the application of force. This makes piezoelectric sensors unsuitable for the detection of static force. Kistler is an example of a company that has been manufacturing variety of strain gage sensors for many years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Rather than generating contact signals representing the contact force magnitude, in some applications one might be interested in a sensory system that generates a binary signal; one signal when the contact force is zero and another signal when the contact force is not zero. In such cases the sensory system of the instrumented glove will be instrumented by a momentary switch rather than a force sensor. When the operator pushes against an object, the momentary switch is pressed and a set contact signals will be sent to transmitter circuitry representing a non-zero contact force. When the operator is not pushing against any object, the momentary switch is not pressed and either a different set of contact signals representing zero contact force will be sent to transmitter circuitry or no contact signal will be sent to transmitter circuitry. A momentary switch is defined here as a switch that shorts (or opens) a circuit as long as the switch is held pressed. When the momentary switch is not pressed, the embedded spring of the switch brings the switch back to its normally open position (or normally closed). </paragraph>

In this embodiment, sensory system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> comprises a C-shape bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> connected to glove <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> by glue or other fastening means. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, C-shape bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> was sewn to glove <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> at locations <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. C-shape bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> creates a solid surface on which the operator can push. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> show two views of sensory system <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>.

The function of holding bracket <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is two fold; holding bracket <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> adds structural rigidity to C-shape bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and also creates a platform to hold a housing for transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Many non-metallic materials and designs are available to one skilled in the art for cover bracket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Cover bracket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> must dissipate the heat generated by transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> while preventing penetration of dust, dirt or water. Two holes are present on cover bracket <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Hole <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference>) is for accessing on-off switch <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and hole <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) is for accessing recharge plug <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. When C-shape bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is pushed along arrow direction <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>), force-sensing resistor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> measures the compression force that C-Shape bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> imposes on an object. Since C-shape bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is in firm contact with the object, the force measured by force-sensing-resistor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> represents the force that is imposed on the object by C-shape bracket <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As their name implies, force-sensing resistors (FSR) use the electrical property of resistance to measure the force (or pressure) applied to a sensor. The force-sensing resistor is a polymer thick film (PTF) device, which exhibits a decrease in resistance with any increase in force applied to the active surface. The resistive material serves to make an electrical path between the two sets of conductors. Over a wide range of forces, as more force is applied to the sensor, the smaller the resistance of the sensor will become and therefore the sensor conductivity is a function of force on the sensor. With a typical FSR sensor, a human finger applying a force from 0.1N to 10N will cause the sensor to change resistance continuously from above 1M&OHgr; to around 2K&OHgr;. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows the FSR force vs. resistance typical response behavior. For interpretational convenience, the force vs. resistance data is plotted on a log/log format. At the low force end, a switch-like response is evident. This threshold, or &ldquo;break force,&rdquo; swings the resistance from greater than 1M&OHgr; to about 50 &OHgr;-100 &OHgr; (the beginning of the power-law). At the high force end of the dynamic range, the response deviates from the power-law behavior, and eventually saturates to a point where increases in force yield little or no decrease in resistance. </paragraph>

The output voltage, V<highlight><subscript>O</subscript></highlight>, can then be read in micro-computer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> located in transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary embodiment, a 1K&OHgr; resistor is used for feedback resistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The above describes examples of several preferred embodiments. Many other variations, which would be obvious to one skilled in the art, are possible. For example, in all embodiments described above, the control signals representing the human operator force are transmitted using 900 MHz radio frequency waves; other frequencies can equally be used for transmission of the control signals from transmitter circuitry <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. When hardware and costs justify, one could use Infrared (IR) signals for transmission of the control signals. Of course IR signals would be useful only when there is a direct line of sight between the transmitter and receiver. Infrared rays occupy that part of the electromagnetic spectrum with a frequency less than that of visible light and greater than that of most radio waves, although there is some overlap. In some special cases where wires and cables do not interfere with the operator motion, one could use a set of signal wires to transmit control signals that represent the human operator force. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a material handling manipulator <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is hung from the ceiling and a signal cable <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is used to transmit control signals, representing the operator force, to controller <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Carbon nanotubes including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTS) are grown in a manner that facilitates the formation of distinct, individual nanotubes. In one example embodiment of the present invention, SWNT probe-tips for applications such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) are synthesized on silicon pyramids for integration, for example, onto AFM cantilevers. In another implementation, the growth of SWNTs involves dip coating of silicon pyramids with a liquid phase catalyst followed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using methane for growing SWNTs. In another implementation, SWNTs are shortened in an inert atmosphere to achieve desirable lengths, for instance, as used in AFM tips. With these approaches, large-scale arrays of nanotubes can be manufactured, for example, using contact printing for catalyst deposition and controllably shortening the nanotubes via an inert discharge. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to carbon nanotubes and, more particularly, to carbon nanotubes and their fabrication using a catalyst precursor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Carbon nanotubes are unique carbon-based, molecular structures that exhibit interesting and useful electrical properties. There are two general types of carbon nanotubes, referred to as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). SWNTs have a cylindrical sheet-like, one-atom-thick shell of hexagonally-arranged carbon atoms, and MWNTs are typically composed of multiple coaxial cylinders of ever-increasing diameter about a common axis. Thus, SWNTs can be considered to be the structure underlying MWNTs and also carbon nanotube ropes, which are uniquely-arranged arrays of SWNTs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Due to their unique electrical properties, carbon nanotubes are being studied for development in a variety of applications. These applications include, among others, chemical and bio-type sensing, atomic force microscopy (AFM), field-emission sources, selective-molecule grabbing, nano-electronic devices, and a variety of composite materials with enhanced mechanical and electromechanical properties. For general information regarding carbon nanotubes, and for specific information regarding SWNTs and its applications, reference may be made generally to the above-mentioned patent documents, and also to: &ldquo;Carbon Nanotubes: Synthesis, Structure, Properties and Applications,&rdquo; M. S. Dresselhaus, G. Dresselhaus and Ph. Avouris (Eds.), Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, New York, 2001; and &ldquo;T. Single-shell Carbon Nanotubes of 1-nm Diameter,&rdquo; Iijima, S. &amp; Ichihashi, Nature 363, 603-605 (1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Many electronic devices benefit from small-scale electronic circuits and arrangements, and also play an important role in a variety of applications. The size and electrical properties of nanotubes including carbon nanotubes make them potentially useful for such small-scale devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is one particular application for which carbon nanotubes are useful. AFM has been a powerful tool for a wide range of fundamental research and technological applications. Atomic force microscopes employ a probe tip used to obtain an image of a specimen, with the size and shape of the probe tip being related to the lateral resolution and fidelity of images obtained using the AFM arrangement. Carbon nanotube tips present ideal characteristics for enhancing the capabilities of AFM in imaging, manipulation and nanofabrication due to their sharpness, high aspect ratios, high mechanical stiffness and resilience, and chemical characteristics. AFM tips employing carbon nanotubes exhibit advantages over conventional AFM tips, such as longer durability, deep structure probing capability, and high lateral resolution in imaging and lithographic applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, carbon nanotubes exhibit characteristics that make them useful for a variety of implementations. However, such nanotubes have been difficult to manufacture and implement in a variety of such applications. For instance, obtaining individual, high quality, single-walled nanotubes has proven to be a difficult task. Existing methods for the production of nanotubes, including arc-discharge and laser ablation techniques, yield bulk materials with tangled nanotubes. The nanotubes in the bulk materials are mostly in bundled forms. These tangled nanotubes are extremely difficult to purify, isolate, manipulate, shorten and use as discrete elements for making functional devices. Furthermore, many previously-available nanotubes have exhibited molecular-level structural defects, which can result in relatively weak nanotubes with poor electrical characteristics. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming the above-mentioned challenges and others related to the types of devices and applications discussed above and in other implementations. The present invention is exemplified in a number of implementations and applications, some of which are summarized below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to one example embodiment of the present invention, carbon nanotubes including SWNTs are grown on a support structure, such as a silicon tip and/or a pyramid or cone shaped tip on top of a tower structure. In one particular implementation, the SWNTs are formed having radii less than about 1 nanometer and are implemented for use in AFM. In another implementation, arrays of the SWNTs are formed. In still another implementation, nanostructures having a feature size less than about 10 nanometers are fabricated using the SWNTs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment of the present invention, carbon nanotubes are fabricated using a catalyst precursor material, such as a liquid phase catalyst material. A support structure is formed and a portion thereof is coated with the catalyst precursor material. In one implementation, the catalyst precursor material comprises a metal-containing salt and a long-chain molecular compound dissolved in a solvent. The catalyst precursor material is calcined to form a catalyst material, and the support structure with the catalyst is then exposed to a carbon containing gas while heated, for example, in a tube furnace. One or more nanotubes are grown from the support structure as carbon from the carbon-containing gas is deposited thereon using the catalyst material to catalyze a reaction of the carbon-containing gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment of the present invention, an array of carbon nanotube probe tips are grown on a substrate having an array of support structures with a catalyst precursor material thereon. In one implementation, a stamp is coated with a liquid phase precursor material and contacted to the support structure array to transfer the catalyst precursor material thereto. The array is then exposed to a carbon containing gas and heated to form carbon nanotubes on the support structures, such as discussed above. In one implementation, the catalyst precursor material is applied to the support structures without coating portions of the substrate between the support structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In still another example embodiment of the present invention, carbon nanotubes are shortened in a controllable fashion using an inert discharge. A voltage is applied to the carbon nanotubes in an atmosphere having an inert gas. The inert discharge may, for example, be used to shorten nanotubes grown in connection with one or more of the example embodiments and implementations thereof discussed above. In one implementation, a nanotube is shortened via inert discharge shortening by contacting the nanotube to a heavily-doped silicon substrate and applying a voltage between the nanotube and the substrate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> While the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The present invention is believed to be applicable to a variety of different types of devices, and the invention has been found to be particularly suited for nanotube devices, such as AFM probe tips, and the growth of nanotubes using a catalyst material disposed on a tip-type structure. While the present invention is not necessarily limited to such applications, various aspects of the invention may be appreciated through a discussion of various examples using this context. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to an example embodiment of the present invention, carbon nanotubes are grown using methane CVD synthesis of SWNTs using a liquid-phase catalyst precursor material. In one implementation, the liquid-phase precursor material includes three components: a metal containing salt, a long-chain molecular compound, and a solvent. The salt may, for example, include a chloride, sulfate or nitrate material. The long-chain molecule may, for example, include a surfactant, such as soap, or a polymer. The solvent may include one or more of a variety of organic or inorganic solvents, e.g., an alcohol, acetone or water. The liquid-phase catalyst precursor is deposited on a structure and used to form a catalyst for reacting the methane for CVD growth of the SWNTs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a specific example implementation, the salt is a mixture of inorganic chlorides, the long-chain molecular compound is a polymer that serves as a structure-directing agent for the chlorides and the solvent is an alcohol, such as ethanol, methanol or butanol. Exemplary block copolymers that may be used in connection with this example implementation include tri-block copolymers such as pluronic P-123 poly(alkylene oxide) HO(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O)<highlight><subscript>20</subscript></highlight>&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)O)<highlight><subscript>70</subscript></highlight>&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O)<highlight><subscript>20</subscript></highlight>OH (available from BASF, Inc., of Mount Olive, N.J.). Exemplary inorganic chlorides that may be used in connection with this example implementation include AlCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, SiCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, FeCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and MoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. In addition, sulfates, nitrates or other types of salt may be used in place of or in addition to the organic chloride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, aluminum and silicon chlorides are processed via hydrolyses, gellation and polymerization into a network of oxides with the block-copolymer phase directing the structure of a network. Small amounts of iron and molybdenum chlorides, relative to the aluminum and silicon chlorides, are added to the precursor mixture, which leads to a material containing finely dispersed metal oxide catalytic nanoparticles on an alumina/silica matrix. The catalytic nanoparticles serve as active sites for SWNT synthesis. The liquid phase catalyst precursor is formed in one or more thin layers, for example, through dip-coating, spin-coating, patterning transferring, or contact printing techniques. For information regarding a general approach of using block copolymers and inorganic chlorides to produce high surface area mesoporous materials, and for specific information regarding such applications that may be used in connection with one or more example embodiments of the present invention, reference may be made to Yang et al, <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>1998, 396, 152 and to Yang et al, <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>1998, 282, 2244, both of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In another implementation, the catalyst precursor material is formed by first dissolving AlCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>.6H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (about 1.2 g) in methanol (about 9 mL) followed by the addition of SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(about 0.6 mL) to form a first solution. A second solution is prepared by dissolving FeCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>.6H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (about 0.09 g) and MoCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(about 0.006 g, mmol) in ethanol (about 2 mL). A third solution of P-123 (about 1.0 g) in ethanol (about 5 mL) is then combined with the first and second solutions and stirred for about 24 hours. The mixture is aged at room temperature for about 1-3 days to form the catalyst precursor. Solvent is removed from the catalyst precursor, followed by calcination of the catalyst precursor in air to form a precursor material containing iron-oxide nanoparticles supported on a mixed alumina/silica oxide. Such a material is active for the synthesis of SWNTs by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Although the above example recites specific quantities of chlorides and solvents, a variety of quantities of precursor material may be formed using appropriate (similar) ratios of the above materials based on the above quantities. For instance, the ratio of FeCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to ethanol can be increased or decreased by a factor of 10 with respect to the ratio described above, while achieving a catalyst precursor suitable for the growth of carbon nanotubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> liquid phase catalyst precursor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is formed on a tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> disposed on a structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and subsequently calcined to form a catalyst material <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. The catalyst material <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is then used to grow a carbon nanotube from the tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, with example nanotubes grown using this approach shown in scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images respectively in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</cross-reference>, which can be grown substantially free of amorphous carbon. The tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may, for example, include a silicon pyramidal tip integrated onto commercially available AFM cantilevers (e.g., structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). Cantilevers that may be used in connection with the present invention include the FESP type cantilever having a spring constant of about 1N/m (Newton/meter) and manufactured by Digital Instruments of Santa Barbara, Calif. The support structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be formed by any suitable technique such as microlithography, ion milling or etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In one implementation, under an optical microscope equipped with mechanical manipulators, a silicon pyramid tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is dipped into a precursor solution (e.g., contained in a micro-pipette) and pulled out, leaving a drop of liquid catalyst precursor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> on the silicon pyramid tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Due to high surface tension at the tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the droplet tends to retract from the tip of the pyramid and settle around the base of the pyramid, as shown. This dip-coating process may be repeated multiple times (e.g., 5-10) until the catalyst precursor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> in a gel-like state covers approximately half of the pyramid height as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. The tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is then calcined in air at 400&deg; C. for about 1 hour and at 700&deg; C. for about &frac12; hour evaporate solvent and remove a polymer component from the catalyst precursor to form a thin layer of catalyst <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> surrounding the base of the tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and partially coating the sides thereof. The calcining may include, for example, heating a solid or gel-state material to a temperature below its melting point to create a condition of thermal decomposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The nanotubes <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</cross-reference> are grown from tips <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, respectively, by forming a catalyst thereon as discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A and subjecting the tips to chemical vapor deposition using a carbon-containing gas. In one implementation, the carbon containing gas includes methane and the tips <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are heated to approximately 900&deg; C. for about 15 minutes in a 1-inch tube furnace under a methane flow rate of about 1000 mL/min. In another implementation, a carbon containing gas that does not pyrolize at temperatures between about 800&deg; C. and about 1000&deg; C. is used in addition to or in replacement of the methane. In addition, the carbon containing gas may include small concentrations of hydrocarbons such as ethane, butane, propane or benzene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In connection with another example embodiment of the present invention, it has been discovered that a conditioning step of the CVD growth chamber significantly increases the yield of SWNTs grown on pyramidal silicon tips, such as discussed in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C above. In one implementation, the conditioning involves suspending a supported catalyst material in methanol and coating an inner wall of a 1 inch quartz tube reactor with a layer of the catalyst. In connection with this implementation, it has been discovered that SWNT tips grow at a success rate of approximately 20% using a non-conditioned quartz tube reactor, whereas the conditioning step increases the success rate of growing SWNTs on pyramids to approximately 90%. In another implementation, reactive hydrocarbon species (e.g., higher order hydrocarbons and/or radicals such as CH<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>or C<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>) are generated by the reactions between CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and the catalyst in the chamber environment. These species feed the growth of SWNTs on the pyramids more effectively than CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In another implementation, during CVD growth of a nanotube from the pyramid tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, SWNTs nucleate near the base portion of the tip and lengthen in various directions. As growth terminates, the nanotube (or bundle of nanotubes) adheres to the surface of the pyramid tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and extends off the tip, thereby maximizing tube-surface van der Waals interactions. The overlapping section between the pyramid tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the SWNT can be as great as about 10 micrometers in length, or the height of the pyramid tip. A substantial number of SWNTs may also be grown in the plane of the structure <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and situated away from the tip of the pyramid such that they generally do not interfere with an extended SWNT (e.g., nanotube <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>), which is useful, for example, when using the SWNT as a probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D shows various stages of manufacture of an array of carbon nanotubes, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. The array may be grown using, for example, one or more of the nanotube growth approaches discussed above, using a liquid phase precursor material to facilitate the production of the array. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, an array <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of a plurality of support structures including structure <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is shown formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The support structure <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may, for example, include pyramidal or conical silicon tip arrays obtained by microfabrication processes such as photolithography, dry etching and oxidation-sharpening. A layer of catalyst precursor material <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is coated onto a flat stamp <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, stamp <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is made from an elastic material such as polydimethylsilane (PDMS). Stamp <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is coated with precursor material <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> by any suitable means. In one implementation, the stamp <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is coated via spin coating, wherein the stamp <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> spins at a rate of about 5000 revolutions per minute (rpm) for about 10 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the coated stamp <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is pressed against substrate <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to transfer the catalyst precursor material <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to the array <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of support structures. The coated support structure array <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is then calcined as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, for example, in a manner consistent with the examples discussed above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Using support structure <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as an example, the calcining results in calcined catalyst material <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> extending over at least a portion of the support structure <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, nanotubes including nanotubes <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> are grown on the array <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of support structures using, for example, the CVD approach discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows support structures <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> in a tower-tip form and extending from a substrate <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. The support structures <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> may be used, for example, in connection with the example embodiments discussed above with FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>D (e.g., as a replacement for or in addition to the array <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of support structures). The structures <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> include cone-shaped tips <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> disposed on top of towers <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, respectively. This approach is particularly conducive to deposition of catalyst precursor material onto sides of the cone-shaped tips <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, for example, using a stamping approach similar to that discussed above. This tower-tip approach also inhibits catalyst material from collecting on portions <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> between support structures <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> during stamping. </paragraph>

The height of the cone-shaped tips (e.g., tip <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) is about <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> micrometers and the height of the towers (e.g. <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>) is 55 micrometers. </paragraph>

The printing is effected using a pad <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> having a layer of catalyst material <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, which is transferred to the tip-on-tower structures <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> for subsequent growth of nanotubes therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> shows SEM images of SWNTs grown off silicon tips <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>473</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>, such as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, with the SWNTs oriented about normal to a substrate, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. In one implementation, the silicon tip-on-tower structures <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>473</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight> (or, e.g., similar structures formed in an array as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) are arranged on an array of AFM cantilevers fabricated on a silicon wafer. With this approach, CVD synthesis can be combined with the carbon nanotube growth approaches discussed herein to form molecular probe tips in a large-scale approach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment of the present invention, carbon nanotubes are shortened using an inert discharge shortening approach. In many applications, including those discussed above, SWNTs extend between 1-20 micrometers in length beyond growth structures, such as the pyramid tip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It is sometimes desirable to shorten the nanotubes to about 30-100 nanometers in length, such as for forming rigid AFM probe tips (e.g., as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>). In order to shorten the nanotubes, a voltage is applied thereto in the presence of inert gas, which results in an electrical arc discharge. Inert atmospheres that can be implemented in connection with this example embodiment include nitrogen (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and noble gases such as helium, neon, argon, xenon and krypton. In one implementation, SWNTs are shortened in Argon using between about 20-50 volts applied between the SWNT and a substrate. In such an inert atmosphere, the concentrations of oxygen and other reactive molecules are relatively low compared to ambient conditions, which significantly limits the probability and length scale of a discharge event near the end of a sharp tip under high electric fields. With this approach, the length of nanotubes including SWNTs can be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show force calibration curves before and after, respectively, inert discharge shortening of a relatively long (about 5 micrometers prior to shortening) SWNT on a cantilever tip, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, cantilever amplitude is plotted vs. distance for an as-grown carbon nanotube. The cantilever is oscillated at the amplitude shown, with the as-grown nanotube contacting, or tapping, across a surface. During extension (solid curve <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>), the SWNT is too soft to cause a noticeable decrease in the cantilever amplitude as it crashes into a substrate (e.g., the nanotube bends rather than causing a decrease in the amplitude). During retraction (dashed curve 520), however, the amplitude response curve shows oscillating variations, indicating &lsquo;stick-slip&rsquo; motions of the nanotube as it is pulled off the substrate (e.g., the nanotube stick and slips at atom sites or unit cells on the substrate). In the amplitude vs. distance curve of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, the nanotube has been shortened to less than about 40 nanometers, resulting in a stiff SWNT that can be used as a probe tip. The cantilever tip is again oscillated, with the amplitude recovery beyond full tube-substrate contact being due to buckling of the SWNT. Little hysteresis exists between extension <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and retraction <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> curves, which is a desired characteristic of high quality probe tips for tapping mode AFM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment of the present invention, a stream of Argon is directed over a cantilever mounted in an AFM with a SWNT extending from a structure on the cantilever. The SWNT is brought into contact with a heavily doped silicon substrate and monitored by a cantilever amplitude vs. distance curve, such as that discussed above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>. A voltage is then applied between the SWNT and the substrate and gradually increased until the loss of nanotube-substrate contact occurs as a result of nanotube shortening. This approach is particularly useful, for example, for reducing the length of SWNTs in steps of about 30 nanometers, providing an excellent control of the length of SWNT probes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment of the present invention, SWNTs are aligned to a substrate using an inert discharge shortening approach, such as discussed above. The shortening process results in strong electrostatic forces between an SWNT and a substrate to which the nanotube is brought into contact, which has also been discovered to promote normal alignment of the SWNT to the substrate. The orientation of the substrate, relative to the SWNT, is selected to achieve a desired SWNT orientation. For instance, when shortening SWNTs extending from a cantilever, it is often desirable for the SWNT to be perpendicular to the cantilever. In this instance, the substrate is oriented parallel with the cantilever, such that the SWNT is oriented perpendicular to the cantilever. With this approach, the inert discharge shortening process helps to orient the SWNT for use in a variety of applications. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Experimental Results </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In connection with one or more of the various example embodiments and implementations discussed above, a variety of experimental results were obtained, with summaries below. These experimental results include AFM imaging of double-stranded &lgr;-DNA (from Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.) absorbed onto freshly cleaved mica surfaces. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows the structure of linear DNA molecules probed by an individual SWNT in air. The imaging was conducted using SWNT AFM tips fabricated as described above. The SWNT radius was approximately 1 nanometer. The inset <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> shows the topography along a line cut across a DNA molecule. The full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the DNA molecule is measured to be 3 nm along the molecule, closely approaching the true width (about 2 nanometers) of double-stranded DNA. The DNA strands also exhibit fine structures along the length, with quasi-periodic corrugations that are spaced at approximately 3-4 nanometer distance, close to the about 3.4 nanometer helical pitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Imaging in aqueous solutions with individual SWNT probe tips should allow high order DNA structures to be clearly resolved with the molecules in native environments and make small probing forces possible due to the absence of undesired capillary forces. Systematic imaging in air with the SWNT tips described above consistently gave apparent widths in the range of 3-5 nanometers for &lgr;-DNA. In comparison, the apparent widths of DNA molecules were about 15&plusmn;5 nanometers observed by using conventional pyramidal tips, and were about 10 nanometers by multi-walled nanotube probes. These results show that individual SWNT tips are promising in improving the lateral resolution of AFM imaging of biological systems to the submolecular level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Scanning probe lithographic fabrication of oxide nanostructures on metal substrates was also carried out with SWNT tips synthesized in connection with one or more of the examples discussed herein. Miniaturization by existing microfabrication methods has previously been limited to the sub-micron scale. Scanning probe lithography may provide a viable route to future nanoscale devices with high throughput in imaging and nanofabrication achievable through AFM equipped with parallel probe arrays. Previous scanning tunneling microscopy work fabricated structures with near atomic resolution under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However, feature sizes obtainable with AFM operating under ambient conditions have been less than about 10 nanometers, limited by the size of the probe tips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The SWNT tips fabricated as described above were able to fabricate TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>nanostructures with feature size below about 10 nanometers. The substrate used was a smooth Titanium film deposited onto atomically flat single crystal &agr;-Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>lines (bright structures) 6 nm wide (FWHM) were fabricated on a Titanium thin film deposited onto an &agr;-Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>substrate. The apparent height of the TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is about 0.8 nanometers. The oxide structures were obtained by applying bias voltages modulated between a&minus;8.5 volt (tip relative to substrate) and &plus;0.5 volt during tapping mode scanning at a rate of about 120-160 micrometers/s. The average tip-substrate distance was maintained at approximately 1 nanometers during the lithographic scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An AFM image recorded by the same SWNT tip after lithographic writing is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. The FWHM of TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>lines is about 6 nanometers. Using SWNT tips, about 6 nanometer TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>nanodots spaced at about a 10 nanometer pitch with a packing density of about 1 Tera-bit per square inch (data not shown) was also fabricated. SWNT AFM tips thus enable the fabrication of nanostructures with feature sizes below the previous 10-nanometer barrier for AFM operation under ambient conditions. This advancement is useful in electronic, recording and other types of miniaturized devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The various embodiments described above are provided by way of illustration only and should not be construed to limit the invention. Based on the above discussion and illustrations, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that various modifications and changes may be made to the present invention without strictly following the exemplary embodiments and applications illustrated and described herein. For instance, such changes may include modifying the nanotubes for one or more particular applications, altering the nanotube arrangements, and where appropriate, using SWNTs as building blocks for more complex devices. Moreover, the nanotubes may be made of materials other than carbon, such as silicon and boron, which can also be grown using a synthesis process similar to that described above. Such modifications and changes do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present invention, which is set forth in the following claims. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Nanotubes and nanotube-based devices are implemented in a variety of applications.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to carbon nanotube devices and more particularly to chemical and biological sensors and related applications employing carbon nanotubes. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Carbon nanotubes are unique carbon-based, molecular structures that exhibit interesting and useful electrical properties. There are two general types of carbon nanotubes, referred to as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). SWNTs have a cylindrical sheet-like, one-atom-thick shell of hexagonally-arranged carbon atoms, and MWNTs are typically composed of multiple coaxial cylinders of ever-increasing diameter about a common axis. Thus, SWNTs can be considered to be the structure underlying MWNTs and also carbon nanotube ropes, which are uniquely-arranged arrays of SWNTs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Due to their unique electrical properties, carbon nanotubes are being studied for development in a variety of applications. These applications include, among others, chemical and bio-type sensing, field-emission sources, selective-molecule grabbing, nano-electronic devices, and a variety of composite materials with enhanced mechanical and electromechanical properties. More specifically, for example, in connection with chemical and biological detection, carbon nanotubes are being studied for applications including medical devices, environmental monitoring, medical/clinical diagnosis and biotechnology for gene mapping and drug discovery. For general information regarding carbon nanotubes, and for specific information regarding SWNTs and its applications, reference may be made generally to the above-mentioned patent documents, and also to: &ldquo;Carbon Nanotubes: Synthesis, Structure, Properties and Applications,&rdquo; M. S. Dresselhaus, G. Dresselhaus and Ph. Avouris (Eds.), Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, New York, 2001; and &ldquo;T. Single-shell Carbon Nanotubes of 1-nm Diameter,&rdquo; Iijima, S. &amp; Ichihashi, Nature 363, 603-605 (1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Sensing chemical and biological species plays an important role in many industrial, agricultural, medical, and environmental processes. Detection of NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas, for example, provides a crucial measure of environmental pollution due to combustion or automotive emissions. In industrial, medical and living environments, the amount of NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>also needs to be closely monitored. Moreover, there is a growing need to detect biological species in a variety of biomedical applications. However, previously-used sensors typically must operate at elevated temperatures to enhance chemical reactivity, and often require long recovery times (if recoverable at all), poor reproducibility, and are applicable to the detection of a very limited range of chemical species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Many electronic devices benefit from small-scale electronic circuits and arrangements, and also play in important role in a variety of applications. The size and electrical properties of nanotubes including carbon nanotubes make them potentially useful for such small-scale devices. However, previously-available nanotubes have been difficult to manufacture and implement in a variety of such applications. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming the above-mentioned challenges and others related to carbon nanotube devices and their implementations. The present invention is exemplified in a number of implementations and applications, some of which are summarized below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to an example embodiment of the present invention, a nanotube device includes a nanotube extending between two conductive elements. The conductive elements are coupled to one or more of a variety of circuit elements, such as those typically found in sensors and integrated circuit devices. The nanotube device is responsive to a variety of electrical, physical and chemical stimuli, and is adaptable for implementation with many applications, such as for sensing and nanoelectronic applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one example embodiment of the present invention, the nanotube device discussed above is used in chemical and biological sensor applications. In another example embodiment of the present invention, individually separable nanotubes are grown in a controlled fashion. In another example embodiment of the present invention, the nanotube device is manipulated and integrated into a functional device such as an electrical, mechanical and/or electrochemical device that can be individually tailored to a wide range of applications. In still another example embodiment of the present invention, the nanotube device is modified to tune its sensitivity to a variety of molecular and/or biological species using one or more materials disposed on the nanotube. With these and other approaches, electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical nanotube devices, including those employing carbon nanotubes, can be individually tailored to a wide range of applications. In addition, these nanotube devices demonstrate significant and robust response, and more significantly, tunable selectivity to chemical or biological species in selected environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another example embodiment of the present invention, a nanotube device includes a substrate with two catalyst islands disposed thereon. Each catalyst island is adapted for growing nanotubes when exposed to a hydrocarbon gas at elevated temperatures. Using this approach, at least one nanotube is formed between, with its two ends rooted in, the two catalyst islands. Metal electrodes are then placed to fully cover the catalyst islands and the two ends of the bridging nanotube. The metal electrodes are useful, for example, for electrically coupling the nanotube to other circuitry, such as for measuring an electrical response of the nanotube. In one particular implementation, the nanotube device is coated and/or decorated with one or more sensing agents, such as metal particles, polymers, and biological species, which imparts sensitivity to the nanotube for particular molecular species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment of the present invention, The selectivity of the nanotube to chemical species is physically tuned for exhibiting a selected response, for example, by applying a gating voltage to a nanotube. The gating voltage effectively shifts the Fermi energy level of the nanotube, giving rise to change in electrical conductivity of the nanotube upon adsorption of foreign chemical species. With this approach, a gating voltage can be applied to the nanotube, for example, to achieve a particular response of the nanotube to the presence of selected chemical species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment of the present invention, a nanotube device comprises a substrate covered with a layer of catalyst material. The catalyst enables the growth of nanotubes when exposed to a hydrocarbon gas at elevated temperatures, yielding a film of interconnected nanotubes disposed on the substrate. Two metal electrodes (e.g., an alloy of nickel-gold, or titanium-gold) are then deposited onto the two opposing sides of the film, separated by a gap devoid of any metal. Such a nanotube film device can be easily produced in a scaled-up fashion with low cost. For instance, in one implementation, the substrate is made of quartz and the catalyst comprises Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and alumina nanoparticles. Nanotubes thus produced are generally single-walled carbon nanotubes that are semiconducting and/or metallic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The above summary of the present invention is not intended to describe each illustrated embodiment or every implementation of the present invention.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention is believed to be useful for a variety of different types of devices, and the invention has been found to be particularly suited for carbon nanotube-based sensors and sensing applications, such as for sensing chemical and biological species. While the present invention is not necessarily limited to such applications, various aspects of the invention may be appreciated through a discussion of various examples using this context. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In connection with an example embodiment of the present invention, it has been discovered that a nanotube device including a nanotube having electrodes at opposite ends thereof exhibits characteristics useful in a variety of implementations. In various implementations, the nanotube is altered physically, chemically or electrically, such as by coating with a metal or other substance or by applying a gating voltage thereto. These alterations tailor the nanotube device to particular applications, such as for making the nanotube respond electrically to a particular molecular species or for making the nanotube respond electrically in a manner similar to semiconducting substrates. With these approaches, the nanotube device can be implemented in a variety of applications. For more information regarding nanotubes, and methods of fabrication thereof, that can be used in connection with the present invention, reference may be made to &ldquo;Synthesis of Single Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on Patterned Silicon Wafers,&rdquo; J. Kong, H. T. Soh, A. Cassell, C. F. Quate, and H. Dai, <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>395, 878 (1998)., which is fully incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one example embodiment of the present invention, a carbon nanotube extends between two electrodes and over a semiconductor substrate, such as doped silicon with a layer of oxide formed thereon. The electrodes include a catalyst material, such as, Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and alumina nanoparticles, and a conductive material disposed thereon, thereby forming conductive catalyst islands (e.g., about 3-5 microns in cross-sectional length). In one implementation, the nanotube is a single-walled carbon nanotube. In another implementation, the metal electrodes include an alloy such as nickel-gold or titanium-gold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C show a carbon nanotube device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at various stages of manufacture, with individually distinct nanotubes being formed over a silicon substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> layer of resist <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is disposed and patterned on a top surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may include, for example, one or more of silicon, alumina, quartz, silica, silicon nitride and/or doped silicon with a layer of native oxide formed thereon. The resist <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is patterned using one or more commonly-available techniques, such as electron-beam lithography, to form a patterned resist structure with openings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> therein that expose the underlying substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The size of the openings is selected for controlling the size of catalyst islands to be subsequently filled therein, and in one implementation, the openings are about 5 microns in diameter and spaced at a distance of about 10 microns. Catalyst material <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed in the openings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and over the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, filling the openings as shown by dashed lines. In one implementation, the catalyst material <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes about 15 mg of alumina nanoparticles, about 0.05 mmol of Fe(NO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)39H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, and about 0.015 mmol of MoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(acac)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mixed in about 15 ml of methanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the remaining portion of the resist layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is lifted off after the catalyst material <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is formed in the openings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and in the instance where solvent (i.e., methanol) is used in forming the catalyst material, after the solvent dries. An array of isolated catalyst islands including islands <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> thus remains over the substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, with the number, size and orientation of catalyst islands being selected via the formation of the patterned layer of resist <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> After the catalyst islands are formed, the nanotube device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is heated to above about 900 degrees Celsius (e.g., in a tube furnace) while exposed to a flow of methane to decompose the Fe(NO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to a Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/nanoparticle (e.g., alumina nanoparticles) mixture, with results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. The Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/nanoparticle mixture catalyzes the growth of carbon nanotubes when exposed to the methane gas at the elevated temperature and a plurality of carbon nanotubes <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are grown as shown. The catalyst islands <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> optionally include a material such as iron, molybdenum, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, zinc and oxides thereof, and in one implementation, the catalyst islands are coated with a metal for tailoring the device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for use in sensing chemicals. With these approaches, the carbon nanotubes grown are predominantly individually distinct, single-walled nanotubes with few structural defects and are substantially straight, typically extending up to more than 10 microns in length with diameters ranging from 1-3 nanometers. Moreover, a number of the carbon nanotubes formed bridge adjacent islands, such as the carbon nanotubes <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>. Such a nanotube bridge forms when a tube growing from one catalyst island falls on and interacts with another island during the synthesis process as described above. These bridged nanotubes are useful for a variety of implementations, including those discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Nanotube-based chips produced using the techniques discussed in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C can be incorporated into a variety of electronic and mechanical devices. In one particular implementation, nanotubes bridging two catalyst islands are cut mechanically or electrically using an AFM (atomic force microscopy) tip to form a device having a single nanotube bridging two catalyst islands. Electron-beam lithography is then employed to deposit metal electrodes onto the two catalyst islands bridged by the nanotube, with the metal electrodes including, for example, an alloy of nickel-gold or titanium-gold. In one implementation, the metal electrodes are formed of about 20 nanometers of nickel with 60 nanometers gold on top of the nickel. These electrodes provide electrical connections between the nanotube and macroscopic electronic circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a nanotube device single nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> disposed between two catalyst islands <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on a substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. The catalyst islands <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the carbon nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be formed, for example, in a manner similar to that described above in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C. In addition, in one implementation, the nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Two metal electrodes <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are formed over the catalyst islands <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and contacting opposite ends of the carbon nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Electrical contact can then made across the carbon nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the electrodes <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for detecting electrical characteristics of the carbon nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, such as for detecting a response of the carbon nanotube to exposure to a particular molecular species. A gate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is optionally disposed below the nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and configured and arranged to apply a voltage signal to the nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for controlling electrical characteristics thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B show front and top views, respectively, of a film of nanotubes at stages of synthesis on a substrate, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, a</cross-reference> layer of catalyst <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is spin-coated over a substrate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as a substrate including one or more of: silicon, alumina, quartz, silica and silicon nitride. In one implementation, the catalyst <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is prepared by mixing <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> mg of alumina nanoparticles, 0.05 mmol of Fe(NO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)39H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, and 0.015 mmol of MoO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(acac)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in 15 ml of methanol. After the catalyst layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed, the catalyst-covered substrate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is heated to above 900 C in a flow of methane (e.g., as discussed above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows an interconnected film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of single-walled carbon nanotubes on the substrate grown from the catalyzed reaction of the methane. Two metal electrodes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are formed over the substrate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> using, for example, evaporation with a shadow mask (not shown) and with a metal-free gap being between the two electrodes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, one or both of the metal electrodes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes about 20 nanometers of titanium with about 60 nanometers of gold formed thereon. In another implementation, one or both of the metal electrodes are made of an alloy, such as nickel-gold or titanium-gold. In other implementations, the nanotube film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is chemically and/or physically modified, such as by coating the nanotube film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with materials such as metals or biological molecules. Such modification may, for example, be effected to impart sensitivity of the nanotube film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to selected chemical or biological species. In one particular implementation, the nanotube is modified by coupling one or molecules to the nanotube that cause a charge transfer between the nanotube and the molecules, such as via electron withdrawal (e.g., using NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or electron donation (e.g., using NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). The charge transfer leads to a change in the electrical conductance of the nanotube. With these approaches, nanotube film devices can be easily produced in a scaled-up fashion with low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The nanotube devices described above can be further physically or chemically modified, so as to be tailored for a particular application. For instance, in connection with an example embodiment of the present invention, it has been discovered that a semiconducting or metallic carbon nanotube exhibits a change in electrical conductance when exposed to certain chemical gases. This change may, for example, result from adsorption of the gas particles on the nanotube. It has further been discovered that, by depositing one or more sensing agents onto the nanotube, sensitivity of the nanotube to a wide range of chemical and biological species can be achieved. Furthermore, the sensing agent(s) can be chosen to cause a response of the nanotube to selected molecules (e.g., so that the nanotube exhibits particular characteristics when exposed to the selected molecules). The selectivity of the nanotube to chemical species can be also tuned, or changed, by applying a gating voltage to the nanotube, for example, via the gate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> adjacent to the nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The gating voltage effectively shifts the Fermi energy level of the nanotube, enabling the nanotube to be more responsive to a particular species. In one particular implementation, a gating voltage in the range of about &minus;20 to 20 volts is applied to the nanotube. The embodiments described hereinafter demonstrate example functionality and versatility of nanotubes and nanotube devices to which the present invention is directed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show electrical responses (conductance versus time) of a device including a semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube to various amounts of NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>gas, respectively, according other example embodiments of the present invention. The electrical responses shown may, for example, be obtained using the nanotube device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, wherein the nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a single-walled carbon nanotube. In one implementation, the single-walled carbon nanotube device is placed in an enclosure, such as a glass flask, equipped with electrical feedthrough (e.g., electrical couplers extending to the carbon nanotube, such as via the electrodes <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). The electrical feedthrough can be used to make electrical connections between the single-walled carbon nanotube device and electrical detection circuits outside the enclosure. A carrier gas (e.g., Ar or air), diluted with NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, is flowed through the flask while the electrical response of the nanotube is detected. The single-walled carbon nanotube device exhibits fast and significant response to the introduction of 20 ppm NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and a mixture including 1% NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, respectively, shown at introduction points <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 420</cross-reference> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. In addition, the inset in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows a comparison of the resulting change in conductance of the single-walled carbon nanotube device when mixtures of 20 ppm and 2 ppm of NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at curves <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, respectively, is introduced. Similarly, curve <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> shows the response of the single-walled carbon nanotube device when exposed to a mixture of about 0.1% NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In connection with another example embodiment of the present invention, it has been discovered that the electrical characteristics of a nanotube exposed to a gas, such as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, is able to fully recover in a flow of pure carrier gas over a period of several hours. In this regard, a pure carrier gas is flowed over a nanotube device after being used to detect the presence of a gas. The pure carrier gas effectively removes interaction of the gas being detected with the nanotube device, and the electrical characteristics of the nanotube device return to that exhibited before introduction of gas. For example, in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the pure carrier gas is flowed such that the single-walled carbon nanotube device returns to a conductance near 0.0, where it was before the introduction of the NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Similarly, in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the carrier gas is flowed such that that single-walled carbon nanotube device returns to a conductance of about 1.7e-6, where it was before the introduction of the NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. With these approaches, nanotube devices can be implemented as re-usable sensors, with recovery enhanced by the flow of a pure carrier gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows an electrical response curve <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of current versus time for a gold-decorated single nanotube to thiol vapor, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. The electrical response curve <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may, for example, be for the nanotube device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> with gold applied to the nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as a sensing agent. In one implementation, gold is deposited on a carbon nanotube by evaporation, which decorates the nanotube (e.g., rather than forming a continuous layer on the nanotube, due to the tendency of gold to not wet carbon). The observed response <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of the nanotube to thiol is affected by the presence of the gold particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In a more particular implementation, a layer of thiol is formed on the gold-decorated nanotube discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> above, and the nanotube is subsequently used to link to biological molecules, which is facilitated by the thiol layer. The electrical response of the nanotube is detected and used to detect the presence of the biological molecules. With this approach, nanotube devices, such as the device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, can be implemented as a versatile biological sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows electrical responses <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> (current vs. time) of an as-grown nanotube film (e.g., a nanotube mat) device and a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate)covered nanotube film device to a mixture including about 2 ppm of NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas, respectively, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. The nanotube film device may, for example, include the nanotube film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. In one implementation, the PMMA coating is about 100 nanometers thick, and its presence significantly improves the sensitivity and the response time of the nanotube device to N<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. More specifically, after the introduction of NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at point <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>, the portion <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> of curve <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> shows a relatively slow response of the device. However, referring to portion <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> of curve <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> for the PMMA-covered nanotube film device, the response at point <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> is relatively faster, with curve portion <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> being nearly vertical. With this approach, the speed at which gasses, such as NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, can be detected is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> shows the electrical response curve <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> (current vs. time) of a gold-decorated nanotube film device to thiol vapor, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. In this example embodiment, gold particles are first evaporated onto a nanotube film, such as the film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, and a monolayer of thiol with carboxylic functional group is subsequently attached to the nanotube film. The presence of thiol modifies the electrical conductance of the nanotube device, with the resulting curve <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> shown with the introduction of thiol vapor at point <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows the detection of avidin (a protein) using a thiol-coated-gold-decorated nanotube film device, such as the device discussed in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. It has been discovered that, when exposed to avidin, the carboxylic groups of thiol molecules on the thiol-coated-gold-decorated nanotube film device link to avidin molecules via carbodimide chemistry. This link to avidin molecules gives rise to a change in electrical conductance of the nanotube film device, shown by curve <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, with the introduction of the avidin molecules occurring at point <highlight><bold>735</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, the nanotube device is disposed in a liquid environment during introduction of the avidin. In further implementations, additional proteins are detected using a similarly-coated nanotube device in a manner not inconsistent with those described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the detection of H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>using a Palladium-modified nanotube film device, according to another example embodiment of the present invention. Palladium particles are deposited onto and decorate a nanotube film, such as film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, with electrodes <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> being used for detecting an electrical characteristic of the film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. It has been discovered that the Palladium-decorated nanotube responds to H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>molecules. This response can be used to detect the presence of the H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>molecules. In this regard, curve <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> shows the response (current vs. time) of the nanotube film with the introduction of a mixture having about 2% H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>molecules in dry air at curve portions <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>. The nanotube device recovers when the H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is removed (e.g., with dry air or other pure carrier gas being flowed across the device), as shown at curve portions <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In another example embodiment of the present invention, an enzyme is attached to a nanotube or a nanotube film, such as the nanotube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and/or the nanotube film <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. It has been discovered that such an enzyme-coated nanotube or nanotube film exhibits changes in its electrical conductance when exposed to glucose and to biological species. With this approach, nanotube and nanotube film-based sensors, such as those described above, employing enzyme-coated nanotubes can be used for detecting glucose and/or biological species, which is particularly useful in a variety of medical applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In other example embodiments of the present invention, various other materials are used to modify the electrical response of nanotubes and/or nanotube films in a manner similar to one or more of the example embodiments and implementations described herein. For instance, a carbon nanotube can be modified to respond electrically to CO. Such an electrical response is useful, for example, for detecting the presence and/or quantity of CO in the exhaust of internal combustion engines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The various embodiments described above are provided by way of illustration only and should not be construed to limit the invention. Based on the above discussion and illustrations, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that various modifications and changes may be made to the present invention without strictly following the exemplary embodiments and applications illustrated and described herein. For instance, such changes may include modifying the nanotubes for sensing one or more particular molecular species, altering the circuit arrangements, interchanging nanotube films and single nanotubes, and where appropriate, using SWNTs as building blocks for more complex devices. Moreover, in addition to the sensing agents described in the example embodiments and implementations above, other materials can be applied to the nanotubes and nanotube devices for tailoring their application. For example, metal particles (e.g., nickel, rhodium, palladium, TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), polymers, and biological species are used as sensing agents in various implementations to modify the sensitivity of nanotubes to chemical and biological species. Furthermore, the nanotubes may be made of materials other than carbon, such as silicon and/or boron, which can also be grown using a synthesis process similar to that described above. Such modifications and changes do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present invention, which is set forth in the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to organic electroluminescent devices with organic films between anodic and cathodic electrodes, and more particularly to such devices and methods for their assembly using the condensation of various silicon moieties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Organic electroluminescent devices have been known, in various degrees of sophistication, since the early 1970&apos;s. Throughout their development and consistent with their function and mode of operation, they can be described generally by way of their physical construction. Such devices are characterized generally by two electrodes which are separated by a series of layered organic films that emit light when an electric potential is applied across the two electrodes. A typical device can consist, in sequence, of an anode, an organic hole injection layer, an organic hole transport layer, an organic electron transport layer, and a cathode. Holes are generated at a transparent electrode, such as one constructed of indium-tin-oxide, and transported through a hole-injecting or hole-transporting layer to an interface with an electron-transporting or electron-injecting layer which transports electrons from a metal electrode. An emissive layer can also be incorporated at the interface between the hole-transporting layer and the electron-transporting layer to improve emission efficiency and to modify the color of the emitted light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Significant progress has been made in the design and construction of polymer- and molecule-based electroluminescent devices, for light-emitting diodes, displays and the like. Other structures have been explored and include the designated &ldquo;DH&rdquo; structure which does not include the hole injection layer, the &ldquo;SH-A&rdquo; structure which does not include the hole injection layer or the electron transport layer, and the &ldquo;SH-B&rdquo; structure which does not include the hole injection layer or the hole transport layer. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,357 and in particular col. 1 thereof, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The search for an efficient, effective electroluminescent device and/or method for its production has been an ongoing concern. Several approaches have been used with certain success. However, the prior art has associated with it a number of significant problems and deficiencies. Most are related to the devices and the methods by which they are constructed, and result from the polymeric and/or molecular components and assembly techniques used therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The fabrication of polymer-based electroluminescent devices employs spin coating techniques to apply the layers used for the device. This approach is limited by the inherently poor control of the layer thickness in polymer spin coating, diffusion between the layers, pinholes in the layers, and inability to produce thin layers which leads to poor light collection efficiency and the necessity of high D.C. driving voltages. The types of useful polymers, typically poly(phenylenevinylenes), are greatly limited and most are environmentally unstable over prolonged use periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The molecule-based approach uses vapor deposition techniques to put down thin films of volatile molecules. It offers the potential of a wide choice of possible building blocks, for tailoring emissive and other characteristics, and reasonably precise layer thickness control. Impressive advances have recently been achieved in molecular building blocks&mdash;especially in electron transporters and emitters, layer structure design (three versus two layers), and light collection/transmission structures (microcavities). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, further advances must be made before these devices are optimum. Component layers which are thinner than achievable by organic vapor deposition techniques would allow lower DC driving voltages and better light transmission collection characteristics. Many of the desirable component molecules are nonvolatile or poorly volatile, with the latter requiring expensive, high vacuum or MBE growth equipment. Such line-of-site growth techniques also have limitation in terms of conformal coverage. Furthermore, many of the desirable molecular components do not form smooth, pinhole-free, transparent films under these conditions nor do they form epitaxial/quasiepitaxial multilayers having abrupt interfaces. Finally, the mechanical stability of molecule-based films can be problematic, especially for large-area applications or on flexible backings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In order to realize high resolution information displays, the microfabrication of light-emitting diodes and pixel arrays is required. So far, several approaches have been employed. One such approach involves patterning the anode and/or cathode of the device structure, the other patterning the emitting materials. The bottom ITO electrode is commonly patterned using a combination of standard photolithography and wet chemical etching, while the top electrode is typically defined by deposition through a shadow mask. Generally, there are disadvantages associated with each of these procedures, such as the difficulty of precise shadow mask alignment for multiple deposition, and frequent mask replacement or cleaning for high dimensional control of the underlying display panel. Alternatively, the cathode and/or anode could be altered using laser ablation. However, with patterned substrates, vacuum deposition of the organic materials does not efficiently coat the steep edges and sharp corners of the anode, thereby resulting in poor coverage which can lead to cathode-to-anode short circuits.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In light of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide electroluminescent articles and/or devices and method(s) for their production and/or assembly, thereby overcoming various deficiencies and shortcomings of the prior art, including those outlined above. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that one or more aspects of this invention can meet certain objectives, while one or more other aspects can meet certain other objectives. Each objective may not apply equally, in all its respects, to every aspect of this invention. As such, the following objects can be viewed the alternative with respect to any one aspect of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide control over the thickness dimension of a luminescent medium and/or the conductive layers of such a medium, to control the wavelength of light emitted from any electroluminescent device and enhance the efficiency of such emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It can be another object of the present invention to provide molecular components for the construction and/or modification of an electroluminescent medium and/or the conductive layers thereof, which will allow lower driving and/or turn-on voltages than are available through use of conventional materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It can also be an object of the present invention to provide component molecules which can be used effectively in liquid media without resort to high vacuum or MBE growth equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It can also be an object of the present invention to provide conformal conductive layers and the molecular components thereof which allows for the smooth, uniform deposition on an electrode, substrate surface and/or previously-deposited layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It can also be an object of this invention to provide an electroluminescent medium having a hybrid structure and where one or more of the layers is applied by a spin-coat or vapor deposition technique to one or more self-assembled conductive layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from this summary of the invention and its descriptions of various preferred embodiments, and will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art having knowledge of various electroluminescent devices and assembly/production techniques. Such objects, features, benefits and advantages will be apparent from the above as taken into conjunction with the accompanying examples, data, figures and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, alone or with consideration of the references incorporated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> This invention describes, in part, a new route to the fabrication of light-emitting organic multilayer heterojunction devices, useful for both large and small, multicolored display applications. As described more filly below, electron and hole transporting layers, as well as the emissive layer, as well as any other additional layers, are applied, developed and/or modified by molecular self-assembly techniques. As such, the invention can provide precise control over the thickness of a luminescent medium or the conductive layers which make up such a medium, as well as provide maximum light generation efficiency. Use of the present invention provides strong covalent bonds between the constituent molecular components, such that the mechanical, thermal, chemical and/or photochemical stability of such media and/or conductive layers, as can be used with an electroluminescent device, are enhanced. The use of such components also promotes conformal surface coverage to prevent cracks and pinhole deformities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the siloxane self-assembly techniques described herein allow for the construction of molecule-based electroluminescent media and devices. As described more fully below, various molecular components can be utilized to control the thickness dimension of the luminescent media and/or conductive layers. Nanometer dimensions can be obtained, with self-sealing, conformal coverage. The resulting covalent, hydrophobic siloxane network imparts considerable mechanical strength, as well as enhancing the resistance of such media and/or devices to dielectric breakdown, moisture intrusion, and other degradative processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In part, the present invention is an electroluminescent article or device which includes (1) an anode, (2) a plurality of molecular conductive layers where one of the layers is coupled to the anode with silicon-oxygen bonds and each of the layers is coupled one to another with silicon-oxygen bonds, and (3) a cathode in the electrical contact with the conductive layers. More generally and within the scope of this invention, an anode is separated from a cathode by an organic luminescent medium. The anode and the cathode are connected to an external power source by conductors. The power source can be a continuous direct, alternating or an intermittent current voltage source. A convenient conventional power source, including any desired switching circuitry, which is capable of positively biasing the anode with respect to the cathode, can be employed. Either the anode or cathode can be at ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The conductive layers can include but are limited to a hole transport layer, a hole injection layer, an electron transport layer and an emissive layer. Under forward biasing conditions, the anode is at a higher potential than the cathode, and the anode injects holes (positive charge carriers) into the conductive layers and/or luminescent medium while the cathode injects electrons therein. The portion of the layers/medium adjacent to the anode forms a hole injecting and/or transporting zone while the portion of the layers/medium adjacent to the cathode forms an electron injecting and/or transporting zone. The injected holes and electrons each migrate toward the oppositely charged electrode, resulting in hole-electron interaction within the organic luminescent medium of conductive layers. A migrating electron drops from its conduction potential to a valence band in filling a hole to release energy as light. In such a manner, the organic luminescent layers/medium between the electrodes performs as a luminescent zone receiving mobile charge carriers from each electrode. Depending upon the construction of the article/device, the released light can be emitted from the luminescent conductive layers/medium through one or more of edges separating the electrodes, through the anode, through the cathode, or through any combination thereof. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,783 and, in particular cols. 4-6 and FIG. 1 thereof, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As would be understood by those skilled in the art, reverse biasing of the electrodes will reverse the direction of mobile charge migration, interrupt charge injection, and terminate light emission. Consistent with the prior art, the present invention contemplates a forward biasing DC power source and reliance on external current interruption or modulation to regulate light emission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As demonstrated and explained below, it is possible to maintain a current density compatible with efficient light emission while employing a relatively low voltage across the electrodes by limiting the total thickness of the organic luminescent medium to nanometer dimensions. At the molecular dimensions possible through use of this invention, an applied voltage of less than about 10 volts is sufficient for efficient light emission. As discussed more thoroughly herein, the thickness of the organic luminescent conductive layers/medium can be designed to control and/or determine the wavelength of emitted light, as well as reduce the applied voltage and/or increase in the field potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Given the nanometer dimensions of the organic luminescent layers/medium, light is usually emitted through one of the two electrodes. The electrode can be formed as a translucent or transparent coating, either on the organic layer/medium or on a separate translucent or transparent support. The layer/medium thickness is constructed to balance light transmission (or extinction) and electrical conductance (or resistance). Other considerations relating to the design, construction and/or structure of such articles or devices are as provided in the above referenced U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,783, such considerations as would be modified in accordance with the molecular conductive layers and assembly methods of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, the conductive layers have molecular components, and each molecular component has at least two silicon moieties. In highly preferred embodiments, each silicon moiety is a halogenated or alkoxylated silane and silicon-oxygen bonds are obtainable from the condensation of the silane moieties with hydroxy functionalities. In preferred embodiments, the present invention employs an anode with a substrate having a hydroxylated surface portion. The surface portion is transparent to near-IR and visible wavelengths of light. In such highly preferred embodiments the hydroxylated surface portions include SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, In<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.xSnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Ge and Si, among other such materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In conjunction with anodes and the hydroxylated surface portions thereof, the conductive layers include molecular components, and each molecular component has at least two silicon moieties. As discussed above, in such embodiments, each silicon moiety is a halogenated or alkoxylated silane, and silicon-oxygen bonds are obtainable from the condensation of the silane moieties with hydroxy functionalities which can be on a surface portion of an anode. Consistent with such preferred embodiments, a cathode is in electrical contact with the conductive layers. In highly preferred embodiments, the cathode is vapor deposited on the conductive layers, and constructed of a material including Al, Mg, Ag, Au, In, Ca and alloys thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In part, the present invention is a method of producing a light-emitting diode having enhanced stability and light generation efficiency. The method includes (1) providing an anode with a hydroxylated surface; (2) coupling the surface to a hole transport layer having a plurality of molecular components, with each component having at least two silicon moieties reactive with the surface, with coupling of one of the silicon moieties to form silicon-oxygen bonds between the surface and the hole transport layer; (3) coupling the hole transport layer to an electron transport layer, the electron transport layer having a plurality of molecular components with each of the components having at least two silicon moieties reactive with the hole transport layer, with the coupling of one of the silicon moieties to form silicon-oxygen bonds between the hole and electron transport layers; and (4) contacting the electron transport layer with a cathode material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of this method, the hole transport layer includes a hole injecting zone of molecular components and a hole transporting zone of molecular components. Likewise, in preferred embodiments, each silicon moiety is a halogenated or alkoxylated silane such that, with respect to this embodiment, coupling the hole transport layer to the electron transport layer further includes hydrolyzing the halogenated or alkoxylated silane. Likewise, with respect to a halogenated or alkoxylated silane embodiment, contacting the electron transport layer with the cathode further includes hydrolyzing the silane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In part, the present invention is a method of controlling the wavelength of light emitted from an electroluminescent device. The inventive method includes (1) providing in sequence a hole transport layer, an emissive layer and an electron transport layer to form a medium of organic luminescent layers; and (2) modifying the thickness dimension of at least one of the layers, each of the layers including molecular components corresponding to the layer and having at least two silicon moieties reactive to a hydroxy functionality and the layers coupled one to another by Si&mdash;O bonds, the modification by reaction of the corresponding molecular components one to another to form Si&mdash;O bonds between the molecular components, and the modification in sequence of the provision of the layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of this inventive method, at least one silicon moiety is unreacted after reaction with a hydroxy functionality. In highly preferred embodiments, modification then includes hydrolyzing the unreacted silicon moiety of one of the molecular components to form a hydroxysilyl functionality and condensing the hydroxysilyl functionality with a silicon moiety of another molecular component to form a siloxane bond sequence between the molecular components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In highly preferred embodiments, the silicon moieties are halogenated or alkoxylated silane moieties. Such embodiments include modifying the thickness dimension by hydrolyzing the unreacted silane moiety of one of the molecular components to form a hydroxysilyl functionality and condensing the hydroxysilyl functionality with a silane moiety of another molecular component to form a siloxane bond sequence between the molecular components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> While the organic luminescent conductive layers/medium of this invention can be described as having a single organic hole injecting or transporting layer and a single electron injecting or transporting layer, modification of each of these layers with respect to dimensional thickness or into multiple layers, as more specifically described below, can result in further refinement or enhancement of device performance by way of the light emitted therefrom. When multiple electron injecting and transporting layers are present, the layer receiving holes is the layer in which hole-electron interaction occurs, thereby forming the luminescent or emissive layer of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The articles/devices of this invention can emit light through either the cathode or the anode. Where emission is through the cathode, the anode need not be light transmissive. Transparent anodes can be formed of selected metal oxides or a combination of metal oxides having a suitably high work function. Preferred metal oxides have a work function of greater than 4 electron volts (eV). Suitable anode metal oxides can be chosen from among the high (&gt;4 eV) work function materials. A transparent anode can also be formed of a transparent metal oxide layer on a support or as a separate foil or sheet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The devices/articles of this invention can employ a cathode constructed of any metal, including any high or low work function metal, heretofore taught to be useful for this purpose and as further elaborated in that portion of the incorporated patent referenced in the preceding paragraph. As mentioned therein, fabrication, performance, and stability advantages can be realized by forming the cathode of a combination of a low work function (&lt;4 eV) metal and at least one other metal. Available low work function metal choices for the cathode are listed in cols. 19-20 of the aforementioned incorporated patent, by periods of the Periodic Table of Elements and categorized into 0.5 eV work function groups. All work functions provided therein are from Sze, <highlight><italic>Physics of Semiconductor Devices</italic></highlight>, Wiley, New York, 1969, p.366. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A second metal can be included in the cathode to increase storage and operational stability. The second metal can be chosen from among any metal other than an alkali metal. The second metal can itself be a low work function metal and thus be chosen from the above-referenced list and having a work function of less than 4 eV. To the extent that the second metal exhibits a low work function it can, of course, supplement the first metal in facilitating electron injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the second metal can be chosen from any of the various metals having a work function greater than 4 eV. These metals include elements resistant to oxidation and, therefore, those more commonly fabricated as metallic elements. To the extent the second metal remains invariant in the article or device, it can contribute to the stability. Available higher work function (4 eV or greater) metal choices for the cathode are listed in lines 50-69 of col. 20 and lines 1-15 of col. 21 of the aforementioned incorporated patent, by periods of the Periodic Table of Elements and categorized into 0.5 eV work function groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As described more fully in U.S. Pat. No. 5,156,918 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, the electrodes and/or substrates of this invention have, preferably, a surface with polar reactive groups, such as a hydroxyl (&mdash;OH) group. Materials suitable for use with or as electrodes and/or substrates for anchoring the conductive layers and luminescent media of this invention should conform to the following requirements: any solid material exposing a high energy (polar) surface to which layer-forming molecules can bind. These may include: metals, metal oxides such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, MgO, and Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(sapphire), semiconductors, glasses, silica, quartz, salts, organic and inorganic polymers, organic and inorganic crystals and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Inorganic oxides (in the form of crystals or thin films) are especially preferred because oxides yield satisfactory hydrophilic metal hydroxyl groups on the surface upon proper treatment. These hydroxyl groups react readily with a variety of silyl coupling reagents to introduce desired coupling functionalities that can in turn facilitate the introduction of other organic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The physical and chemical nature of the anode materials dictates specific cleaning procedures to improve the utility of this invention. Alkaline processes (NaOH aq.) are generally used. This process will generate a fresh hydroxylated surface layer on the substrates while the metal oxide bond on the surface is cleaved to form vicinal hydroxyl groups. High surface hydroxyl densities on the anode surface can be obtained by sonicating the substrates in an aqueous base bath. The hydroxyl groups on the surface will anchor and orient any of the molecular components/agents described herein. As described more fully below, molecules such as organosilanes with hydrophilic functional groups can orient to form the conductive layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Other considerations relating to the design, material choice and construction of electrodes and/or substrates useful with this invention are as provided in the above referenced and incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,783 and in particular cols. 21-23 thereof, such considerations as would be modified by those skilled in the art in accordance with the molecular conductive layers, and assembly methods and objects of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The conductive layers and/or organic luminescent medium of the devices/articles of this invention preferably contain at least two separate layers, at least one layer for transporting electrons injected from the cathode and at least one layer for transporting holes injected from the anode. As is more specifically taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,720,432, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, the latter is in turn preferably at least two layers, one in contact with the anode, providing a hole injecting zone and a layer between the hole injecting zone and the electron transport layer, providing a hole transporting zone. While several preferred embodiments of this invention are described as employing at least three separate organic layers, it will be appreciated that either the layer forming the hole injecting zone or the layer forming the hole transporting zone can be omitted and the remaining layer will perform both functions. However, enhanced initial and sustained performance levels of the articles or devices of this invention can be realized when separate hole injecting and hole transporting layers are used in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Porphyrinic and phthalocyanic compounds of the type described in cols. 11-15 of the referenced/incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,783 can be used to form the hole injecting zone. In particular, the phthalocyanine structure shown in column 11 is representative, particularly where X can be, but is not limited to, an alkyltrichlorosilane, alkyltrialkoxysilane, dialkyldialkoxysilane, or dialkyldichlorosilane functionality and where the alkyl and alkoxy groups can contain 1-6 carbon atoms or is hydrogen. Preferred porphyrinic compounds are represented by the structure shown in col. 14 and where R, T<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and T<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>can be but are not limited to an alkyltrichlorosilane, alkyltrialkoxysilane, dialkyldialkoxysilane, or dialkyldichlorosilane functionality and where the alkyl and alkoxy groups contain 1-6 carbon atoms or is hydrogen. (See, also, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, herein.) Preferred phthalocyanine- and porphyrin-based hole injection agents include silicon phthalocyanine dichloride and 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine silicon (IV) dichloride, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The hole transporting layer is preferably one which contains at least one tertiary aromatic amine, examples of which are as described in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C and Examples 1 and 2. Other exemplary arylamine core structures are illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 3,180,730, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, where the core structures are modified as described herein. Other suitable triarylamines substituted with a vinyl or vinylene radical and/or containing at least one active hydrogen containing group are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,409,783, 3,567,450 and 3,658,520. These patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and the core structures disclosed are modified as described herein. In particular, with respect to the arylamines represented by structural formulas XXI and XXIII in cols. 15-16 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,703, R<highlight><subscript>24</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><superscript>25</superscript></highlight>, R<highlight><superscript>26</superscript></highlight>, R<highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>, R<highlight><superscript>30</superscript></highlight>, R<highlight><superscript>31 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>32 </superscript></highlight>can be an alkyltrichlorosilane, alkyltrialkoxysilane, dialkyldialkoxysilane, or dialkyldichlorosilane functionality where the alkyl and alkoxy groups can contain 1-6 carbon atoms or is hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Molecular components of this invention comprising emissive agents and/or the emissive layer include those described herein in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C and Example 5. Other such components/agents include various metal chelated oxinoid compounds, including chelates of oxine (also commonly referred to as 8-quinolinol or 8-hydroxyquinoline), such as those represented by structure III in col. 8 of the referenced and incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,783, and where Z<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>can be but is not limited to an alkyltrichlorosilane, alkyltrialkoxysilane, dialkyldialkoxysilane, or dialkyldichlorosilane functionality and where the alkyl and alkoxy groups can contain 1-6 carbon atoms or is hydrogen. Other such molecular components/emissive agents include the quinolinolato compounds represented in cols. 7-8 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,629, also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, where a ring substituent can be but is not limited to an alkyltrichlorosilane, alkyltrialkoxysilane, dialkyldialkoxysilane, or dialkyldichlorosilane functionality and where the alkyl and alkoxy groups can contain 1-6 carbon atoms or is hydrogen. In a similar fashion, the dimethylidene compounds of U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,603, also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, can be used, as modified in accordance with this invention such that the aryl substituents can include an alkyltrichlorosilane, alkyltrialkoxysilane, dialkyldialkoxysilane, or dialkyldichlorosilane functionality and where the alkyl and alkoxy groups can contain 1-6 carbon atoms or is hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Other components which can be used as emissive agents include without limitation anthracene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene, perylene and other fused ring compounds, or as provided in col. 17 of the previously referenced and incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,783, such compounds as modified in accordance with this invention and as more fully described above. Modifiable components also include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,172,862, 3,173,050 and 3,710,167&mdash;all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Molecular components which can be utilized as electron injecting or electron transport agents and/or in conjunction with an electron injection or electron transport layer are as described in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C and Examples 3(a)-(d) and 4. Other such components include oxadiazole compounds such as those shown in cols. 12-13 of U.S. Pat. No. 5,276,381, also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, as such compounds would be modified in accordance with this invention such that the phenyl substituents thereof each include an alkyltrichlorosilane, alkyltrialkoxysilane, dialkyldialkoxysilane, or dialkyldichlorosilane functionality and where the alkyl and alkoxy groups can contain 1-6 carbon atoms or is hydrogen. Likewise, such components can be derived from the thiadiazole compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,546 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As described above, inorganic silicon moieties can be used in conjunction with the various molecular components, agents, conductive layers and/or capping layers. In particular, silane moieties can be used with good effect to impart mechanical, thermal, chemical and/or photochemical stability to the luminescent medium and/or device. Such moieties are especially useful in conjunction with the methodology described herein. Degradation is minimized until further synthetic modification is desired. Hydrolysis of an unreacted silicon/silane moiety provides an Si&mdash;OH functionality reactive with a silicon/silane moiety of another component, agent and/or conductive layer. Hydrolysis proceeds quickly in quantitative yield, as does a subsequent condensation reaction with an unreacted silicon/silane moiety of another component to provide a siloxane bond sequence between components, agents and/or conductive layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In general, the molecular agents/components in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be prepared with a lithium or Grignard reagent using synthetic techniques known to one skilled in the art and subsequent reaction with halosilane or alkoxysilane reagents. Alternatively, unsaturated olefinic or acetylenic groups can be appended from the core structures using known synthetic techniques. Subsequently, halosilane or alkoxysilane functional groups can be introduced using hydrosilation techniques, also known to one skilled in the art. Purification is carried out using procedures appropriate for the specific target molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It has been observed previously that the performance characteristics of electroluminescent articles of the type described herein can be enhanced by the incorporation of a layer having a dielectric function between the anode and, for instance, a hole transport layer. Previous studies show that the vapor deposition of thin layers of LiF onto an anode before deposition of the other layer(s) improves performance in the areas of luminescence and quantum efficiency. However, this technique is limited in that the deposited LiF films are rough, degrade in air and do not form conformal, pinhole-free coatings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also directed to the application of self-assembly techniques to form layers which cap an electrode, provide dielectric and other functions and/or enhance performance relative to the prior art. Such capping layers are self-assembled films which are conformal in their coverage, can have dimensions less than one nanometer and can be deposited with a great deal of control over the total layer thickness. Accordingly, the present invention also includes an electroluminescent article or device which includes (1) an anode, (2) at least one molecular capping layer coupled to the anode with silicon-oxygen bonds, with each capping layer coupled one to another with silicon-oxygen bonds, (3) a plurality of molecular conductive layers, with one of the layers coupled to the capping layer with silicon-oxygen bonds and each conductive layer coupled one to another with silicon-oxygen bonds, and (4) a cathode in electric contact with a conductive layer. Likewise, and in accordance with this invention, the capping layer can be deposited on a conductive layer and/or otherwise introduced so as to be adjacent to a cathode, to enhance overall performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> More generally and within the scope of this invention, the anode is separated from the cathode by an organic luminescent medium. The anode and cathode are connected to an external power source by conductors. The power source can be a continuous direct, alternating or intermittent current voltage source. A convenient conventional power source, including any desired switching circuitry, which is capable of positively biasing the anode with respect to the cathode, can be employed. Either the anode or cathode can be at ground potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, each conductive and/or capping layer has molecular components, and each molecular component has at least two silicon moieties. In highly preferred embodiments, each such conductive and/or capping component is a halogenated or alkoxylated silane, and silicon-oxygen bonds are obtainable from the condensation of the silane moieties with hydroxy functionalities. Without limitation, a preferred capping material is octachlorotrisiloxane. The anode and cathode can be chosen and/or constructed as otherwise described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In part, the present invention is a method of using molecular dimension to control the forward light output of an electroluminescent device. The inventive method includes (1) providing an electrode and a molecular layer thereon, the layer coupled to the electrode with first molecular components having at least two silicon moieties reactive to a hydroxy functionality; and (2) modifying the thickness of the layer by reacting the molecular components with second components to form a siloxane bond sequence between the first and second molecular components, the second molecular components having at least two silicon moieties also reactive to a hydroxy functionality. In preferred embodiments of this inventive method, at least one silicon moiety is unreacted after reaction with a hydroxy functionality. In highly preferred embodiments, the modification further includes hydrolyzing an unreacted silicon moiety of one of the molecular components to form a hydroxysilyl functionality and condensing the hydroxysilyl functionality with a silicon moiety of a third molecular component to form a siloxane bond sequence between the second and third molecular components. In highly preferred embodiments, the silicon moieties are halogenated or alkoxylated silane moieties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In part, the present invention also includes any electroluminescent article for generating light upon application of an electrical potential across two electrodes. Such an article includes an electrode having a surface portion and a molecular layer coupled and/or capped thereon. The layer includes molecular components, and each component has at least two silicon moieties. The layer is coupled to the electrode with silicon-oxygen bonds. In preferred embodiments, each silicon moiety is a halogenated silane, and silicon-oxygen bonds are obtained from a condensation reaction. Likewise, and without limitation, the electrode has a substrate with a hydroxylated surface portion transparent to near-IR and visible wavelengths of light. Such a layer can be utilized to cap the electrode and/or enhance performance as otherwise described herein. More generally, in such an article or any other described herein, the luminescent medium can be constructed using either the self-assembly techniques described herein or the materials and techniques of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be modified or otherwise used to control charge migration and the resulting light emission. Micro-contact printing (&mgr;CP) is a widely used soft-lithography technique to chemically pattern the surfaces of various substrates, on which submicron or even nanometric features have been achieved using selective physical or chemical deposition techniques. Xia, Y.; Whitesides, G. M.; <highlight><italic>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. </italic></highlight>1998, 37, 550. The present invention provides a novel approach to pixel fabrication of organic light-emitting diodes and/or related electroluminescent articles using micro-contact printing and/or similar chemical patterning methods. Such printing and/or patterning methods are well-known to those skilled in the art and include, without limitation, the following: micro-filtration membranes; Granstrom, M.; Berggren, M.; Inganas, O.; <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>1995, 27, 1479 ink jet printing; Hebner, T.

Mater. </italic></highlight>1997, 9, 392 The present approach is compatible and can be used in conjunction with various such methods to make the present devices or articles, such methods include thermal evaporation, spin coating, and molecular self-assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As discussed elsewhere, the articles, devices and/or diodes of this invention, including the luminescent media thereof and any modifications thereto, can be prepared using various molecular components/agents and/or conductive layers together with the fabrication and construction methods described herein. Accordingly, the present invention provides generally an electroluminescent article for generating light upon application of an electrical potential across two electrodes. Such an article can include (1) an anode; (2) a plurality of molecular conductive layers, one of the layers coupled to the anode with silicon-oxygen bonds and the conductive layers coupled one to another with silicon-oxygen bonds; (3) a cathode in electrical contact with the conductive layers; and (4) a molecular charge control layer coupled with silicon-oxygen bonds to either one of the electrodes or the conductive layers, with the control layer having a predetermined spatial distribution of molecular components. In preferred embodiments, the charge control layer is predetermined during design and fabrication to provide a pattern of molecular components, such that the pattern defines at least one opening through the control layer to the electrode or conductive layer to which it is coupled. In highly-preferred embodiments, in accordance with this invention, a pattern of openings provides the article with a predetermined pixel array of emitted light at wavelengths controlled as described elsewhere herein. The configurations of such arrays are limited only by the techniques used to apply the patterns on the article during fabrication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A, a</cross-reference> charge control layer of this invention can be applied, bonded and/or coupled directly to an anode. An application of such a patterned layer blocks or raises the energy barrier to hole injection into those regions of a hole transfer layer. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 12C</cross-reference>, a patterned charge control layer can, alternatively, be coupled or applied to any one of the luminescent or conductive layers, such layers including but not limited to hole transport, electron transport and emissive layers. When patterned on a hole transport layer, a charge control layer blocks hole transport into the electron transport layer and impedes emission of light by electron and hole recombination. When applied to or coupled with an electron transport layer, a patterned charge control layer blocks or impedes in those regions electron injection from the cathode into an electron transport layer, also preventing emissive hole and electron recombination. As with all such devices of this invention, enhanced emissive characteristics are observed through the pixel array. Inasmuch as many diode devices of the prior art exhibit inefficient electron injection, fabrication of such a device with a patterned control layer on an electron transport layer can be especially useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> With reference to Example 12, a charge control layer of the present invention is preferably one providing an alkylsiloxane pattern on the electrode or conductive layer. Consistent with the methodologies described elsewhere herein, various silane molecular components can be used to provide the charge control layer and the resulting silicon-oxygen bonds. In preferred embodiments, the silicon moiety of such a molecular component is a halogenated silane, such that a silicon-oxygen bond is obtained from the condensation reaction of the silane with a hydroxy functionality on either the electrode or conductive layer. Octadecyltrichlorosilane is one such preferred component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The controlled charge migration and light emission inherent to the pixel array of this invention is a manifestation of the blocking or barrier effect described above. On a molecular basis, this effect can be achieved by incorporation of the hydrophobic terminus opposite the reactive silicon moiety. While an octadecyl substituent is described as part of a preferred molecular embodiment, a wide range of alkyl substituents can be used with equal effect, such range as would be well-known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As inferred above, the present invention is also a method of using silicon molecular components of a luminescent medium to control charge migration within and the resulting light emission from an electroluminescent device. As described above, such a medium can have a plurality of silicon molecular components, with a predetermined spatial distribution of the components within the medium. This spatial distribution controls hole/electron migration and emissive recombination. For instance and without limitation, the silicon molecular components of the conductive layer(s) of such a medium can have two or more silicon moieties, while other silicon molecular components have one silicon moiety. The patterned spatial distribution of such components can be used on a molecular level to direct charge migration, control the molecular dimension of the conductive portion of a luminescent medium and/or block or extinguish light transmission. As would be well known to those skilled in the art, such a combination of molecular components and related factors can be used effectively to provide a pixel array of the type described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Generally, but with particular reference to the data and information provided in Example 15 and FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the present invention also provides a method of using molecular distribution to control the turn-on voltages and light emission of an electroluminescent device. Use of one or more conductive layers, together with a control layer provides a pattern and/or distribution of molecular components to direct or otherwise control charge migration, recombination and resulting light emission. Such a control layer can comprise molecular components of the type described herein. In preferred embodiments, such components are printed on the applicable electrode or conductive layer. Micro-contact printing is a preferred method; however, other physical or chemical deposition techniques can also be used. One of more conductive layers can be incorporated into a device of this invention, preferably through the molecular self-assembly methods described herein. However, and without limitation, the same or analogous chemical components can also be utilized in conjunction with spin-coating techniques as more fully described in a co-pending application (Ser. No. 60/107,831) entitled &ldquo;Organic Light-Emitting Diodes and Methods for Spin-Coat Assembly&rdquo;, filed on Nov. 10, 1998 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, an increase in voltage enhances the light emitted from the display. Initially, as voltage is applied, light is directed through the pixel array. An increase in voltage (dotted line reference in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>) results in lighting the entire luminescent display of such a device. Without restriction to any one theory or mode of operation, it is believed that an increase in voltage increases hole injection. At higher voltages, holes can tunnel through the printed control layer. Light is no longer directed through the pixel array, but emitted throughout the entire display. Accordingly, the molecular distribution and resulting pixel array can be used to provide a voltage-controlled 3-state display device: initial darkness, a patterned display at low turn-on voltage, and a fully-lit display at higher voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> and Example 12, a stamp and/or mask can be prepared having a relief structure corresponding to the pattern of molecular components to be applied on or contacted to an electrode or conductive layer. Structural variations can provide openings through the control layer to the contacted surface. Such a pattern, together with subsequent application of the appropriate conductive/luminescent layer provides the predetermined spatial distribution of molecular components resulting in the desired pixel array. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Conventional organic electroluminescent devices consisting of TPD (600 &angst;)/Alq (600 &angst;)/Mg (2000 &angst;) were vapor-deposited on ITO substrates modified with the capping material specified in Example 8. FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-C show the behavior of these devices with varying thickness of the self-assembled capping material. These results show that such a material can be used to modify forward light output and device quantum efficiency. For a device with two capping layers, higher current densities and increased forward light output are achieved at lower voltages, suggesting an optimum thickness of capping material can be used to maximize performance of an electroluminescent article. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates how a capping material can be introduced to and/or used in the construction of an electroluminescent article. ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in acetone for 1 hour followed by sonication in methanol for 1 hour. The dried substrates were then reactively ion etched in an oxygen plasma for 30 seconds. Cleaned substrates were placed in a reaction vessel and purged with nitrogen. A suitable silane, for instance a 24 mM solution of octachlorotrisiloxane in heptane, was added to the reaction vessel in a quantity sufficient to totally immerse the substrates. (Other such compounds include those described in Example 8). Substrates were allowed to soak in the solution under nitrogen for 30 minutes. Following removal of the siloxane solution the substrates were washed and sonicated in freshly distilled pentane followed by a second pentane wash under nitrogen. Substrates were then removed from the reaction vessel washed and sonicated in acetone. Substrates were dried in air at 125&deg; C. for 15 minutes. This process can be repeated to form a capping layer of precisely controlled thickness. Capping layer(s) can likewise be used in conjunction with other embodiments of the present invention, where those embodiments would benefit by the functional advantages provided by such a modification. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> A patterned silicon mask was made using conventional photolithographic techniques. The test pattern consisted of a series of cylinders with cross-sectional diameters of 10 &mgr;M -50 &mgr;M extending from the surface of the mask. The distance between two cylinders was 100 &mgr;M. Based on this mask, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps were prepared according to the reported procedure. ITO coated glass plates were provided by Donnelly Company with a sheet resistance of 20 &OHgr;/sq. The cutting, patterning, and cleaning procedures are well-known to those skilled in the art.

Next, a suitable hydrolyzable silane or silicon moiety, such as 10 &mgr;M octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) solution in toluene, was used to ink the PDMS stamps, and to print patterns on ITO substrates for control of charge migration and light emission. The basic inking and printing procedures are also well-known. See, for instance, Kumar, A.; Biebuyck, H. A.; Whitesides, G.

N-N&prime;-diphenyl-N-N&prime;bis(3-methylphenyl)-&lsqb;1-1&prime;-biphenyl&rsqb;-4-4&prime;-diamine (TPD) was employed as a hole transport layer (HTL) and used as received, while 8-tris-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) was purified using vacuum sublimation and used as the emissive and electron transport layer (EML/ETL).

A Keithley 2400 sourcemeter supplied d.c. voltage to the devices and simultaneously recorded the current flowing through the devices. At the same time, an IL 1700 research radiometer with a calibrated silicon photodetector was used to collect the device emission. These instruments were controlled by a PC using LabView software.

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference> show the current-voltage and light output-voltage curves for a patterned device, in accordance with the methods, articles and/or molecular structures of this invention. The insets expand the 15 V -18 V region. From these curves, it can be seen that pixels, as can be provided by the present control layer(s), can begin to turn on at &tilde;12 V. Although the total light output for the tested device is less than optimal at this voltage, the pixel arrays can be clearly observed under an optical microscope. The turn-on voltage is lower than that of a nonpatterned bare ITO device, which is fabricated under the same conditions. The nonpatterned device turns on at 15 V. This phenomenon is attributed to a strongly enhanced electric field at the pixel edges. As the applied voltage is increased, the pixels become brighter and brighter with negligible light emission from the control layer-covered areas until &tilde;16.75 V. The rapid increase of brightness with increasing applied voltage above 16.75 V (insets of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), indicates turning on of the covered areas. At 16.75 V. the measured light output from the patterned device is 20 cd/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Considering the effective device area is 5% of the total area, the light output from an unpatterned device should be 400 cd/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, which is higher than that required for display purposes (100-200 cd/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>). The pixel arrays were observed under an optical microscope. Bright green spots can be clearly seen using a device fabricated in this manner. Other wavelengths or combinations of wavelengths are available and can be provided as described elsewhere herein. As referenced above, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a photograph of the resulting pixel array. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to sensors. More particularly, the present invention pertains to electrochemical metal/metal oxide sensors for various applications, such as for sensing pH and/or hydrogen concentration. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Measurement of chemical parameters, e.g., pH, gas concentrations, etc., are important in many different applications, e.g., control systems, aqueous systems of geothermal-related power generation, nuclear facilities, etc. For example, in the process world, pH is an important parameter to be measured and controlled. The pH of a solution indicates the acidic or basic (i.e., alkaline) characteristics of the solution. The formal mathematical definition of pH is the negative logarithm of hydrogen ion activity. In most cases, hydrogen ion activity can be approximated by the hydrogen ion concentration, and the formula becomes pH&equals;&minus;log10&lsqb;H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;. On the pH scale, which varies from 0 to 14, a very acidic solution has a low pH value, a very basic solution has a high pH value, and a neutral solution has a pH of approximately 7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A pH measurement apparatus is typically made up of several components. Such components include a pH sensor, which includes a measuring electrode, a reference electrode, and in many cases also a temperature sensor. Such components provide measurement signals which are generally operated upon by various devices so as to provide a desired parameter measurement, e.g., a signal conditioning device may be used to provide amplified sensor signals to a processing apparatus for analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary operational state, when immersed in a solution, the measuring electrode of the pH sensor is generally an electrode sensitive to hydrogen ions, and which develops a potential (i.e., voltage) directly related to the hydrogen ion concentration of the solution. The reference electrode provides a stable potential against which the measuring electrode can be compared, i.e., the reference electrode potential does not change with the changing of hydrogen ion concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The output of the measuring electrode may change with temperature (e.g., even though the process remains at a constant pH). As such, the temperature sensor is typically used to correct for this change in output. Such temperature compensation is known and is usually performed in an analyzer which receives the sensed signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The sensed measurement signal and reference signal are generally amplified by a preamplifier prior to application to a processing apparatus for analysis. For example, the preamplifier may take the high impedance pH electrode signal and change it into a low impedance signal which the analyzer can accept. The preamplifier also strengthens and stabilizes the signal, making it less susceptible to electrical noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The processing apparatus is operable to provide a desired parameter measurement output based on the sensed signals. Generally, a value indicative of the pH of the solution is displayed, although data representative of the pH may be used for automatic control in one or more various feedback loops of a control system without display. The calculation and display of pH is usually performed using an analyzer having a human machine interface for calibrating the sensor and configuring outputs and alarms, if pH control is being performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As acidity is among one of the more important chemical parameters in aqueous solutions, effective pH measurements need to be performed. Various types of pH sensors exist for use in providing such measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, for example, a glass electrode has been used to perform such pH measurement. However, glass electrodes are generally only applicable to temperatures below 100&deg; C. In addition, they are generally expensive, fragile, and difficult to miniaturize, which limits potential applications for such electrodes. Recent new developments have replaced glass electrodes with more durable electrodes, for example, solid-state sensors, as indicated further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Further, for example, YSZ ceramic pH sensors have also been used for pH measurement and have been emphasized recently as an effective manner of measuring pH in a hydrothermal fluid, especially in hot spring vents at mid-ocean ridges. For example, exemplary YSZ sensors are described in Ding, K. and Seyfried, W. E. Jr., &ldquo;In-situ measurement of dissolved H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in aqueous fluid at elevated temperatures and pressures,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta</italic></highlight>, Vol 59, pp. 4769-4773 (1995) and Hara N. and Macdonald, D. D., &ldquo;Development of dissolved hydrogen sensors based on yttria-stabilized zirconia solid electrolyte with noble metal electrodes,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Electrochem. Soc</italic></highlight>., Vol.144, pp. 4152-4157 (1997). Although the YSZ pH sensor responds well to pH at elevated temperatures and pressures, it appears to have relatively limited stability at low temperature applications (e.g., less than 200&deg; C.). Also, the sensor&apos;s fragile nature makes applications under high temperature and pressure conditions challenging with potential for mechanical and thermal shock during applications of the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition to glass and YSZ sensors for measuring hydrogen ion concentration, other alternative H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>measurement apparatus in aqueous fluid at elevated temperatures and pressures have been provided in the literature. For example, Chou and Eugster, as described in Chou I. M. and Eugster H. P., &ldquo;A sensor for hydrogen fugacities at elevated P and T and applications,&rdquo; (Abstr.), <highlight><italic>Eos; Trans. Amer. Geophys. Union</italic></highlight>, Vol. 57, p. 340, (1976), developed the Ag&mdash;AgCl&mdash;H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O hydrogen sensor, which primarily depends on H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>permeability through a metallic Pt or Ag&mdash;Pd membrane. In their design, H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>fugacity is indirectly obtained after the experiment by measuring HCI concentrations of the quenched solution in the sensing capsule where the fugacity of Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is fixed. This is not a direct measurement technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Gunter et al., in Gunter W. D., et al., &ldquo;The shaw bomb, an ideal hydrogen sensor,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Contrib. Mineral. Petrol</italic></highlight>., Vol. 70, pp. 23-27 (1979), describes the coupling of a small-volume pressure transducer to a metallic membrane permeable to H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>for measurement of H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>pressure in hydrothermal experiments. Although this technique is a more direct method for measuring H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, it has seen limited use due to problems which affect its sensitivity and resolution as described in Gunter, et al., &ldquo;Hydrogen: Metal membranes,&rdquo; In <highlight><italic>Hydrothermal Experimental Techniques </italic></highlight>(ed. G. C. Ulmer and H. L. Barnes), Chap. 4, pp. 100-120 (1987). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another in-situ method for H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>measurement in high temperature aqueous systems is described in Macdonald D. D., et al., &ldquo;Continuous in situ method for the measurement of dissolved hydrogen in high-temperature aqueous systems,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>I </italic></highlight>&amp; <highlight><italic>E. C Fundamentals</italic></highlight>, Vol. 20, pp. 290-297 (1981). This technique makes use of the H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-dependent resistivity of palladium. The response of this electrode to H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was demonstrated for dissolved H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at concentrations up to 0.72 mM in 0.1 M boric acid, and at temperatures as high as 275&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Palladium/metal-oxide-semiconductor (Pd-MOS) devices have also been reported as a hydrogen sensor for use with high temperature aqueous solutions in Lundstrom, I., &ldquo;Hydrogen sensitive MOS-structures, Part I: principles and applications,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Sensors Actuators </italic></highlight>Vol. 1, pp. 423-426 (1981) and in Fomenko et al., &ldquo;The influence of technological factors on the hydrogen sensitivity of MOSFET sensors,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Sensors Actuators</italic></highlight>, Vol.10, pp. 7-10 (1992). Like other sensors which involve platinoid metals, such devices suffer from irreversible degradation when exposed to hydrogen sulfide or other sulfide bearing solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Fuel cell hydrogen sensors have been used for monitoring dissolved H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in the cooling water of nuclear and fossil fuel power reactors and in transform cooling oil as described in Jonas et al., &ldquo;Evaluation and applications of a new dissolved hydrogen analyzer,&rdquo; 64<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>Ann. Water Conf., Pittsburgh, Pa. (1985). These sensors are based on the platinum-catalyzed oxidation of H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>coupled with reduction of O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. A gas-permeable membrane isolates the fuel cell from the sample. Because the cell consumes H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>faster than it diffuses through the membrane, the cell current is also related to the membrane thickness. However, the minimum practical membrane thickness is determined by the maximum hydrostatic pressure in the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further, pH sensors relating to titanium oxide include the TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>semiconductor pH sensor reported in Hara N. and Sugimoto K., &ldquo;A nb-doped TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>semiconductor pH sensor for use in high-temperature aqueous solutions,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Electrochem. Soc</italic></highlight>., Vol.137, pp. 2517-2523 (1990). As described therein, pH measurement was successfully conducted in distilled water from room temperature up to 250&deg; C. In this design, a Nb-doped TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>single crystal ((001) face) was used as a pH-sensitive electrode. The pH response of this sensor is based on the pH-dependent change in the flatband potential, which can be obtained by measuring the Mott-Schottky plot on the semiconductor electrode in a solution. However, the cost of the single TiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(rutile) crystal may limit practical applications of this sensor. In addition, measurement using such semiconductor sensors functions entirely different than when using electrochemical sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In addition, in Ding, K. and Seyfried, W. E. Jr., &ldquo;Gold as a hydrogen sensing electrode for in-situ measurement of dissolved H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in supercritical fluid,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>J. Sol. Chem</italic></highlight>, Vol. 25, pp. 419-431 (1996), the use of gold in hydrogen sensing was described. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The present invention shall be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Generally, according to at least one embodiment of the present invention, the present invention illustrates a small-scale pH sensor apparatus (e.g., pH sensing electrode) that is operable in various applications, e.g., provide measurements in aqueous fluids for various applications. However, although the sensing electrodes described here are preferably sized to meet small scale application requirements, the present invention is not limited to any particular size limitations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the sensors according to the present invention have broad effective temperature and pressure operating ranges. For example, preferably, the sensing apparatus described herein are capable of providing effective measurements in a temperature operating range from room temperature (e.g., 25&deg; C.) to about 425&deg; C. Further, preferably, such sensing apparatus are capable of providing effective measurements in a pressure operating range up to 500 bars (i.e., approximately 500 atmospheres). Likewise, preferably, the sensing apparatus are formed of materials (e.g., titanium, titanium dioxide, gold, etc.) that do not degrade when exposed to sulfide bearing fluids. Effective measurements as defined herein for measuring pH are measurements that are characterized by stability and reversibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Generally, the pH sensor apparatus includes a hydrogen ion (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) sensitive element formed of a corrosion-resistant metal, such as titanium or zirconium. The pH sensitive element makes use of a discontinuous metal oxide surface layer, e.g., titanium dioxide, on a surface of the metal hydrogen ion (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) sensitive element (e.g., titanium wire core element) which facilitates pH sensing effects and enhances signal-to-noise ratio. In other words, the hydrogen ion (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) sensitive element is a metal/metal oxide element wherein the metal oxide provided on the surface of the metal is discontinuous to allow hydrogen ions to contact the metal layer upon which the surface oxide layer is formed. The pH sensor apparatus according to the present invention may be used with any of a range of standard reference electrodes for providing the pH measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The surface oxide layer is preferably formed by using heat together with chemical agents, which assist with formation of a surface oxidation product. For example, as described further below, alkali element carbonates or peroxides, preferably in liquid form, may be used for this purpose. However, other surface oxide formation processes may be used such as electrochemical plating methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In addition to the direct measurement of pH using the pH sensor apparatus (and an associated reference electrode) according to the present invention, generally in another embodiment, a metal/metal oxide electrode can be used with a hydrogen sensing electrode, e.g., a fine gold wire, for measuring dissolved hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) concentrations. For example, such a hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) sensor apparatus may use the metal/metal oxide pH sensor apparatus as a reference electrode in measurement of hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) concentrations such as hydrothermal fluid. Such hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) concentrations can be effectively measured in the same temperature and pressure operating ranges as described above with reference to the pH sensing apparatus. Effective measurements as defined herein for measuring hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) concentration are measurements that are characterized by stability and reversibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> At least in one embodiment, a gold wire is used as the hydrogen sensing electrode, e.g., the surface of the gold is not pretreated in any manner for use in such a hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) sensor apparatus. However, in one or more embodiments of the hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) sensor apparatus, a lower limit to the temperature at which measurements can be made does exist. The lower temperature limit would appear to be about 125&deg; C. However, such a lower limit to the temperature at which measurements can be made is more than compensated by the specificity, stability, and unparalleled corrosion resistance of various embodiments of the hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) sensor apparatus as described further herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The sensing apparatus described herein may be used in a variety of applications. For example, a considerable number of applications for in-situ chemical sensing has arisen in many high technology and industrial fields. Such applications and markets can be found in various areas, including the power industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the power industry, the efficient operation of water-cooled electrical energy generating systems (e.g., nuclear and fossil based systems) requires the continuous monitoring of dissolved H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in heat transport media of aqueous fluids at temperatures and pressures as high as 500&deg; C. and 200 bars (approximately 200 atmospheres), respectively. Such control is necessary to suppress corrosion and reduce the transport of corrosive products throughout the system. This latter phenomenon can lead to the fouling of heat transfer surfaces, and in the case of nuclear generating systems, to a dispersion of active nuclides such as <highlight><superscript>60</superscript></highlight>Co into out-of-core components. The dissolved H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>concentrations in the primary circuits of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) can be as high as 7.6 ppm, while those in the secondary coolant circuit of a PWR, and the coolant circuit of a BWR (boiling water reactor), are usually less than 1 ppm. Thus, a H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor apparatus, according to the present invention, is very suitable for these applications. Generally, such a sensor apparatus may well be used for safety control in any industrial process which involves water coolant with high temperature heated metal surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In addition, other applications include use of the sensing apparatus in the material industry where hydrothermal synthesis of new chemical compounds for superconductor, chemical, and electronics industries (e.g., where temperatures rise up to 374&deg; C. and pressure is at the saturation line) often depend on redox constraint and dissolved H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>concentrations. For example, the efficacy of pre-cleaning, etching, thermal oxidation and deposition steps in the manufacturing of semi-conductors can be sensitive functions of redox and pH. Availability of sensors with tolerance to corrosive chemical agents and temperature variability would facilitate greatly a number of design, manufacturing and quality assurance processes fundamental to this industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Yet further, in recent years, great progress has been made in destruction of hazardous wastes in supercritical water (e.g., where temperatures used may be as high as 500&deg; C. and pressures may rise to 450 bars). It may indeed be possible to convert hazardous wastes such as PCB&apos;s into innocuous compounds by using supercritical water as an oxidation medium. As such, in-situ sensors, such as those according to the present invention, may be used in such processes, since they allow direct characterization of reactions at elevated temperatures and pressures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Environmental protection applications may also make use of the sensors. For example, nuclear and chemical waste disposal requires measurement and monitoring of hydrogen under many extreme operating conditions. For instance, monitoring possible build-up of potentially flammable or explosive H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is always essential to keep safe guard on an underground nuclear waste storage tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The applications are numerous as described above for the various embodiments of pH sensor apparatus and hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) concentration sensor apparatus described herein. Such broad applications in industrial processes involving aqueous systems at high temperature and pressure include, but are clearly not limited to: geothermal related power generation; other power industries where high-temperature processes involving aqueous fluids are required, such as nuclear and supercritical facilities; supercritical waste treatment systems; and chemical engineering industry using hydrothermal methods. Yet further, other applications may include medical applications including physiology and medical research due to the advantages of small size, high electrical conductivity, and bio-friendly nature of the sensors described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of one illustrative pH sensing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The pH sensing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be employed in any one of a number of different applications for sensing pH as described above. The pH sensing system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a pH sensor apparatus (e.g., pH sensor electrode) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as that described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, a reference electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and processing/analysis circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, e.g., a processor, logic circuitry, signal conditioning circuitry, associated software, associated memory, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Generally, when the reference electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and pH sensor electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are immersed in a solution, the potential of the reference electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> does not change with the changing hydrogen ion (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) concentration. The measuring electrode or pH sensor electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is sensitive to the hydrogen ion (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>), develops a potential (i.e., voltage) directly related to the hydrogen ion (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) concentration of the solution. The reference electrode provides the stable potential against which the potential of the pH sensor electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be compared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The reference electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be any conventional reference electrode. For example, such reference electrodes utilized in the past for measuring pH typically include Ag/AgCl or Hg/HgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The processing/analysis circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may include, for example, a preamplifier to amplify the signals from the electrodes (e.g., electrodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) in its operation as a signal conditioning device. Further, for example, the processing/analysis circuitry <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may include an analog to digital converter for providing digitized data representative of the electrode sensed signal for later processing, or any other measurement-type circuits for comparing voltage or signals from the electrodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to provide a pH measurement. The present invention is not limited to any particular hardware or software configuration. However, such hardware and software is preferably functional to provide a pH parameter to a user based on the sensor signals provided using the electrodes described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The pH sensor electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may take one of various different configurations. Preferably, however, the pH sensor electrode <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes one or more features as described with reference to the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

A sensing head <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> having a hydrogen ion (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) sensitive metal at least partially exposed (e.g., for contact with a fluid to be measured) is located at the second distal end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes an electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is provided as best shown in the perspective view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>. The electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> includes a wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that lies along axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and extends between a first end <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and a second distal end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

However, the present invention is not limited to any particular gauge of titanium wire, e.g., smaller and larger gauge wires may be used. For example, a smaller diameter wire may be used in circumstances where strength is not a substantial factor. Further, one skilled in the art will recognize that the wire as used herein may be of any cross-sectional shape (e.g., square cross-section, elliptical cross-section, polygonal cross-section, etc.); such cross-section taken orthogonal to axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention may also be implemented in one or more embodiments with the discontinuous oxide layer, as further described below, being formed on any metal (i.e., hydrogen ion (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) responsive metal) electrode structure including, for example a simple planar surface. In other words, one or more of the embodiments described herein are not limited to the use of an elongated element (e.g., wire). Further, one will recognize that the sensor need not be configured along a linear axis but could be of any shape (e.g., curvilinear configuration, etc.), for example, depending upon the particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> further includes a surface oxide layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed on at least a portion of the wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at the second distal end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the surface oxide layer is provided on the entire wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, e.g., on the outer radial surface thereof. </paragraph>

Further, generally, the discontinuous surface oxide layer has random discontinuity, e.g., no real pattern to the discontinuity or regions of exposed metal core. For example, the discontinuity of the layer may be in the form of random cracks in the metal oxide layer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Various methods may be used to form the surface oxide layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. For example, various chemical vapor deposition processes, sputtering processes, or any other physical and/or chemical deposition processes may be used to form the preferred discontinuous titanium dioxide surface layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the preferred titanium wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Further, for example, electrochemical plating methods may be used to form the preferred titanium dioxide layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the preferred titanium wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> However, preferably, according to the present invention, the surface oxide layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed using thermal treatment together with an oxygen-containing media (i.e., agent such a liquid oxidizing agent) that assists in formation of a surface oxidation product. Although any oxygen-containing media may be used, preferably, the oxygen-containing media includes a liquefied oxygen-containing media (e.g., a liquid media that can be used to bath the surface of the metal wires immersed therein). Further, preferably, alkali element carbonates or peroxides are used in the thermal treatment process. Such carbonates and peroxides may include, but are clearly not limited to, alkali element carbonates such as Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and Li<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and peroxides such as Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the thermal treatment of a titanium wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for forming the surface oxide layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> thereon is performed at elevated temperatures in the range of about 300&deg; C. to about 880&deg; C. The temperature used may depend, for example, on the temperature required for liquefying the oxygen-containing media. Yet further, an optimum heating time for the thermal treatment depends upon the actual elevated temperature and various other factors of the process. However, preferably, for example, the thermal treatment is performed for a time period less than 2 hours at ambient pressure. Further, preferably, the time period is greater than about 0.5 hours, although with use of higher temperatures and dependent on the type of oxygen-containing media, the time period may even be less than 0.5 hours. </paragraph>

The thermal treatment or heating time is preferably about a 0.5 hour time period after the system attains the desired temperature. In such a manner, a thin discontinuous layer of titanium dioxide is formed that coexists with, but yet allows the native titanium metal of the wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to be exposed; thus, forming a pH sensing pair. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Using the above, the potentials measured by the sensor apparatus described herein can be used to determine a pH measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Considering the strong corrosion resistance of titanium metal and titanium dioxide in acidic, Cl, and sulfide-bearing fluids, along with its mechanical strength, the titanium-based pH electrode greatly enhances the ability to measure and monitor the pH of acidic and corrosive fluids from a variety of industrial and natural environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Other pH measurement apparatus conventionally available do not have all of such capabilities. For example, a YSZ ceramic pH sensor and a metal/metal oxide pH electrode such as iridium, palladium, tungsten, and ruthenium dioxide electrodes are typically not suitable for various reasons including those listed in the background section hereof. For example, YSZ sensors may not be reliable at temperatures below 200&deg; C., owing to their high input impedance. Further, the fragile nature of the YSZ ceramic pH sensor makes applications under high temperature and pressure conditions difficult. As for other metal-metal oxide pH electrodes, their reactivity with sulfide bearing fluids, such as hydrogen sulfide may limit their use. Titanium-based pH sensors, however, do not suffer from such limitations and provide a cost effective sensor relative to other conventional sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The process described herein for forming the discontinuous surface oxide layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is effective for providing a sieve-like structure that allows hydrogen ions (H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>) to pass therethrough and be effectively sensed. With such a process, and due to the mechanical strength of titanium, an electrode with small cross-section area less than or equal to 0.020 inches (0.5 mm) (outer diameter, O.D.) can be constructed. With use of an electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, including the titanium wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a surface titanium oxide layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> thereon, an effective response of the sensor can be provided even at low temperatures. However, such an electrode responds well even at 300&deg; C. and higher temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> With further reference to the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, an insulating material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is provided about the electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> along the axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, the insulating material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may include a ceramic epoxy coating along a length of the titanium dioxide layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed on the titanium wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the titanium/titanium oxide electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The insulating material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> extends to within a particular distance from the second distal end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, leaving a sensing portion or sensor head <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> exposed at the second distal end <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The sensing head <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> provides exposed titanium dioxide surface area which includes openings <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> for allowing the hydrogen ions of a fluid being monitored to pass therethrough so as to contact the underlying exposed titanium wire core <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> To provide an application-ready pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, preferably, a conductive support housing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is formed over at least a portion of the electrically insulating material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to provide an electrode for use in taking potential measurements from the apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> between the electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the conductive support housing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the conductive support housing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> extends over a substantial portion of the insulating material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> from the first end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the second end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> thereof. Although the support housing may be formed of any conductive material, preferably, the support housing is a titanium housing or any other corrosion-resistant housing. Again, such a titanium housing provides for increased mechanical stability to the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and also corrosion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> To seal the electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in the titanium housing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, sealing components <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are utilized. For example, a heat shrinkable Teflon insulator <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> may be used to encompass the electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> at the first end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with a lead <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> terminating and extending from the electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to the exterior of the sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for connection to, for example, processing and/or signal conditioning devices (e.g., the titanium support housing may be connected to ground such that sensor signals are provided via the lead <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>). Further, for example, a metal spacer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be used to hold the electrode element <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> within the support housing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> along with a Teflon sealant <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a ceramic insulator <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Yet further, the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a cooling jacket <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> around the perimeter of the apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> spaced a radial distance from the axis <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. For example, the cooling jacket may include a number of ceramic insulators positioned using O-rings <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> on the support housing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. For example, the cooling jacket may be needed to dissipate heat and protect the Teflon sealant from exceeding temperature limitations. Yet further, the support housing <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is formed with threaded portions <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> for installation of the sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at a particular site for a desired application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will recognize that any configuration for the conductive support housing and the sealing components may be used without departing from the present invention. Such configurations are generally application dependent and as such will take one of many different forms. The illustrative configuration described herein is but one of many different variations that can be used in conjunction with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A pH sensor electrode, such as that described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, may be used in a dissolved hydrogen concentration (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) sensor system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, e.g., for in situ measurement of dissolved hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) in aqueous fluids, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The hydrogen concentration (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) sensor system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, includes a reference electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such as the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, in combination with a hydrogen sensing element <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, such as a gold electrode as is shown and shall be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B. Such hydrogen sensing elements and reference electrodes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may be separate electrodes for use in providing signals to processing/analysis circuitry <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or may be combined into a combination electrode generally represented by dashed line box <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Several embodiments of such a combination electrode apparatus shall be further described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Generally, such a hydrogen concentration (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) sensor can be described in terms of electrochemical formation as follows: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> One of the major advantages of the gold and titanium based hydrogen sensor described here is its potential use in aqueous fluids having high concentrations of dissolved H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S. Unlike platinoid metal-based electrodes, which are often used as hydrogen sensing elements, gold and titanium are completely resistant to dissolved H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S expanding greatly the range of potential applications. Because two of the most chemically resistant materials can be combined in such a way so as to allow dissolved H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>measurements to be made over more than an order of magnitude range in concentrations, and at temperatures as high as 450&deg; C., the likelihood that the hydrogen sensor can be used successfully for long-term monitoring applications involving the most chemically and physically challenging environments is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> One illustrative embodiment of a hydrogen sensing electrode <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that can be used as a separate electrode with the reference electrode <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> by the hydrogen sensing electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. One skilled in the art will note that the general configuration of the hydrogen sensing electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is very similar to the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as shown and described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. However, the electrode element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is preferably a gold wire which, preferably, terminates in a gold foil sensing element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The gold wire electrode element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is coated with a ceramic epoxy coating <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as an insulating material. The insulating material <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> extends along the gold wire to within a distance from the second end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

For example, the gold foil sensing element <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be a cylindrical element lying along axis <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. However, any element that enlarges the sensing surface area may be used according to the present invention. </paragraph>

The electrode element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is sealed within the housing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by sealing components <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which include a metal spacer <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, Teflon sealant <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, ceramic element <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, and a heat shrinkable Teflon insulator <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> about the electrode element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at the first end <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the hydrogen sensing electrode <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Further, a cooling jacket <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> including ceramic insulating elements <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is provided about the perimeter of the support housing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Concentrically configured about the electrode element assembly <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> coated with the insulating layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is conductive support housing <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the support housing is formed of titanium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the support housing <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and many of the other elements of the hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are substantially similar to those described with reference to the pH sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>.

For example, a coupling wire may be soldered to the reference portion of the electrode assembly and a coupling wire may be soldered to the hydrogen sensing electrode portion of the electrode assembly. Once again, the conductive housing <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be grounded such that a potential can be read across the reference electrode and housing and also across the hydrogen sensing electrode and the housing. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a reconfigurable apparatus and method and, more particularly, to a reconfigurable apparatus and method for inspection of parts during a manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Invention Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Manufacturers of mass-produced parts and products, such as vehicles, rely on automated inspection machines for quality control and rejection of defective parts. Consumer demand as well as considerations of safety and efficiency have led to the development of inspection systems that rely on machine vision coordinated with robotics and computer aided design to achieve precision and quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One such inspection system is the coordinate measurement machine or CMM disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,402,582. The CMM uses three linear scales to measure the coordinates of an object in three-dimensional space. The measurements are made by a multi-jointed mechanical measuring arm, which includes measurement transducers. The CMM is connected to a controller in communication with a computer system that provides output for an operator. CMMs are used to measure a variety of different parts mainly in a metrology lab. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Because of the relatively high costs of CMMs, less accurate and less expensive conventional industrial robots equipped with contact sensors are often used for inspection of parts. Another, more accurate, robot-based system equipped with a non-contact sensor is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,166,811. This patent discloses a vision system adapted to retrieve data from the non-contact sensor and position data from a position reporting device and synchronize the image data from the sensor with the position data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> CMMs and robot-based systems operate by moving the sensor around the part to take measurements while the part is stationary. The inspection process is done off-line, preferably in an inspection room. It may take several hours to complete the inspection of a complicated automobile engine part. During this inspection time, bad or defective parts may be produced on the assembly line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There remains, therefore, a need for an improved inspection system that can be used to inspect a family of parts during the manufacturing process, either on or adjacent to the production line and that overcomes the limitations, shortcomings and disadvantages of other known inspection systems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention meets the identified needs, as well as other needs, as will be more fully understood following a review of this specification and drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention includes an inspection apparatus that comprises a conveyor line for moving a first part during a manufacturing process. The conveyor line is either a part of or adjacent to the moving production line. The inspection apparatus also includes a plurality of non-contact sensors, which are mounted on stationary supports around the conveyor line. One or more of the plurality of sensors may be enclosed within an environmentally-controlled chamber. The sensors measure a characteristic of the first part, such as, for example, parallelism, flatness, profile, etc., and produce inspection outputs. The sensors can be reconfigured for inspection of at least one different characteristic of a second part. The second part may be, for example, a new or redesigned part of the same or a related family. The same part in different orientation with respect to the inspection machine or at a different location along the production line and at a different stage during the manufacturing process may also be re-inspected. The apparatus may include shock absorption or vibration isolators. The apparatus may also include a computer system that receives the sensor inspection outputs and produces operator-accessible information. The apparatus may further include an entrance tag reader and an exit tag reader to read and write information from a tag attached to a fixture that holds the inspected part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An additional embodiment of the invention also includes a system for inspecting a first part and a second part. The system comprises a conveyor line, a plurality of stationary supports in proximity to the conveyor line and a plurality of non-contact sensors, which are mounted on stationary supports around the conveyor line. The sensors can be reconfigured for inspection of at least one different characteristic of the second part. The same part in a different orientation with respect to the inspection machine or at a different location along the production line and at a different stage during the manufacturing process may also be re-inspected. The apparatus may also include a computer system that has a communication module in communication with the sensors and the conveyor line, and a decision module that compares the inspection outputs for each inspected part with a computer-stored design of the part within predetermined tolerances. The computer system further includes a control module that issues a command when a tolerance is exceeded. The computer system may further include a feedback module in communication with a Numerical Controller (NC) for the manufacture of the inspected part. The command may optionally be sent to a conveyor controller to stop the conveyor line. A command may also optionally be sent to the numerical controller to stop the numerical controller or to modify a predetermined path of the numerical controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention, and more particularly of the inspection system, includes a conveyor line, a plurality of stationary supports near the conveyor line and a machine vision system comprising a plurality of non-contact sensors, at least one camera and a machine vision processor that communicates with the sensors and the camera and issues a command to a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) regarding the production of a first part. The sensors and the camera are reconfigurably mounted on any of the supports such that the inspection system can be quickly reconfigured for inspecting a second part, such as a new or redesigned part of the same or related family of parts or to re-inspect the same part at a different stage of the manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, the inspected part may be stationary and the supports on which the sensors are reconfigurably mounted may be moving in relation to the stationary part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention includes a method for inspecting parts during a manufacturing process. The method comprises mounting a plurality of non-contact electro-optical sensors in proximity to a moving line holding a first part, measuring at least one characteristic of the first part, producing an inspection output and converting the inspection output to operator-accessible information. The method also includes reconfiguring the sensors for inspection of a second part with different characteristics. The method may further include mounting a camera that interfaces with the sensors and is directed to the conveyor line, and reconfiguring the camera for inspecting the second part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Yet another embodiment of the invention includes a method for inspecting and re-inspecting a part during a manufacturing process. The method comprises mounting a plurality of non-contact electro-optical sensors in proximity to a moving line holding the part, measuring at least one characteristic of the part at a first stage of the manufacturing process, producing an inspection output and converting the inspection output to operator-accessible information. The method also includes reconfiguring the sensors for inspection of the part at a second stage of the manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is a feature of at least one embodiment of the invention to provide an inspection system that can be used to inspect a part as the part moves on a production line or adjacent to a production line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another feature of at least one embodiment of the invention is to provide an inspection system that is easily and quickly reconfigurable for inspection of a different, new or redesigned, part of the same or related family of parts, and for re-inspection of the same part at different stages of the manufacturing process, including at a different location with respect to the production line or at different orientation with respect to the inspection machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is a feature of yet another embodiment of the invention to provide fast feedback for the correction or modification of the manufacturing process so that the production of defective or nonconforming parts is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is another feature of various embodiments of the invention to provide an inspection applicable to a medium or high-volume production of a family of parts where switchovers among the parts within the family may be the practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, various embodiments of the invention provide solutions to the limitations, shortcomings and disadvantages of other inspection systems and methods. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate, however, that these and other details, features and advantages will become further apparent as the following detailed description proceeds.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings for the purpose of illustrating the invention and not for the purpose of limiting the same, there is shown various embodiments of an apparatus and system for inspecting a first part and a second part that belong to the same or related family of parts, or for re-inspecting the same part at different stages of the manufacturing process. Although the invention is not so limited, the inspection apparatus and system may be used, for example, in the production line of an automotive assembly plant or an automotive machining plant, and each inspection apparatus employed may be dedicated to a single family of parts. An automotive production plant may incorporate, for example, one inspection apparatus for cylinder heads, another one for brakes, and so on. It is to be understood that when reference is made herein to a first part and a second part, the first part is the part that is under inspection at current conditions, and the second part is the part that may be inspected after reconfiguring the apparatus or system. Additionally, more than one inspection apparatus may be placed on or along the production line to inspect the same or different parts at different stages of the manufacturing process. Therefore, the second part may be the original part re-inspected by the same inspection apparatus at a different stage of the manufacturing process or by another inspection apparatus at a different location along the production line. Reference to a part without any qualification, is to be understood as reference to a part under inspection. Furthermore, inspection of a part is understood to include inspection of one or more parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that includes a conveyor line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for moving a part during a manufacturing process. The conveyor line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a moving line or slide that transfers parts during machining/production and may include a belt, or other type of conveyor. The conveyor line may be a part of the production line or may be located adjacent to the production line during the manufacturing process. The conveyor line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be automated and controlled by conveyor controller <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The conveyor line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is, preferably, an accurate linear motion slide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> placed on the conveyor line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> moves along the apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may, for example, belong to a family of parts such as cylinder heads. Examples of a first part <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and a second part <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) respectively. The part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be releasably held on a fixture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by any type of fasteners that can quickly and accurately hold and release the part, such as precision clamps and grips, which are commercially available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A plurality of electro-optical devices <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, or detectors for short, are placed around the conveyor line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The detectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may include, for example, non-contact sensors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, including laser-based profilometers, and video cameras and line scanning cameras <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, all of which are commercially available. An example of a fast and accurate non-contact sensor/profilometer that may be used with the invention is the Conoscan 3000, which is manufactured by Optimet Metrolology Limited, Jerusalem, Israel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The detectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, i.e. the sensors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and cameras <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, are mounted on one or more stationary supports <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, or moving supports <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> that can also be kept stationary if it is so desired. The supports may be placed, for example, on each side of or above the conveyor line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A substrate <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may also be one of the supports. Each detector <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be mounted on a groove <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, which may be straight, arcuate or have other shapes, sizes and configuration, on a respective support <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, so that the detector <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be moved or slid along a path defined by the groove <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, or relocated to another groove <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, such that the result is a reconfigured array of detectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The shape, size and length of grooves <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are, preferably, chosen for a particular family of parts, so that changes from a first part <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which may represent, for example, the old design for the part, to a second part <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which may represent the new or redesigned part, can be inspected with accuracy and speed by a single inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which is dedicated to the specified family of parts. Because parts within the same family are typically redesigned so that they maintain certain overall dimensional limitations dictated by the character of the family and, therefore, the new parts still fit within a known volume envelope, the shape and location of the grooves can be chosen so that the sensors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and cameras <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can be reconfigured for the new part <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by moving them and securing them to new positions along the pre-existing grooves <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The reconfiguration can be performed manually or by motors, servo-controllers or other mechanical advantage drivers including micro-electromechanical (MEMS) devices, depending on the application and type of parts and detectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that are used. The sensors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and other detectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be secured within their respective grooves <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> by locking devices (not shown). It may also be desirable to relocate some of the supports <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> along pre-existing apertures and slots on the substrate <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. For details regarding other relocatable supports and locking devices, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,943,750 to Koren et al., assigned to the assignee of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In some applications, it may be desirable to use one inspection apparatus for two different families of parts, especially if the families of parts are closely related, by simply replacing a first set of supports constructed for a first family with a second set of supports constructed for a second family. Additionally, more than one inspection apparatuses may be placed on or along the production line and the same parts may be re-inspected at different stages of the manufacturing process, at different locations along the production line and at different orientations with respect to the inspection apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The inspection apparatus may include vibration isolators <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, including shock absorbers, such as springs, dumpers, layers of vibration-absorbing materials, such as, for example, rubber, etc. The inspection apparatus may further include moving mechanical gages <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, i.e. gages that are attached to and move with the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Additionally, one or more of the detectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, such as, for example, a camera <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, may be mounted on a support <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> that may either be held stationary or move so that that it follows the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as it moves along the conveyor line <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The sensors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> detect and measure one or more characteristics of the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For an inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> dedicated to cylinder heads, for example, the sensors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and cameras <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are selected and configured to enable the inspection of parts with overall dimensions that are appropriate for the cylinder head part family. Other dimensions and configurations may be specified for different applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Examples of characteristics that may be measured within given tolerances, described in reference to, but not limited to the parts of FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Parallelism, i.e. whether a first surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is parallel to a second surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> within a given tolerance. The surfaces may be, for example, planar or curved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Parallelism may also be measured between edges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Flatness of a surface, i.e. whether a surface or part of a surface, such as a first surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> or a second surface <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is planar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Surface roughness, i.e. the presence of surface irregularities, typically left on the part by the machining process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Location of an aperture <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> relative to a given reference, such as, for example, edge <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and diameter measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Profile measurement of surfaces, such as profile <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of surface <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> at a specified location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Detection of a broken tool <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, such as a broken tap that is left in an aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The above characteristics are representative of characteristics that may be detected and measured within given tolerances and accuracy. Other or additional characteristics with various accuracy and tolerance requirements may be selected for inspection and measurement depending on the application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the inspection apparatus may include a radio frequency (RF) identification system that incorporates one or more radio frequency readers, which preferably includes a transceiver (transmitter/receiver) unit. An entrance reader <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is placed at the entrance <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, where the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> enters the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> so that it can read a radio frequency tag <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> attached on the fixture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The tag <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is, preferably, a read/write tag. As the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> enters the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the entrance reader <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> reads the part identification or other information written on the tag <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. As the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> exits the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at exit <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, an exit reader <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> writes other information, such as the inspection outputs from the detectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, on the tag <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, as is explained herein below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may also include a computer system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> that communicates with the detectors <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, including the sensors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the cameras <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The computer system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> receives inspection outputs from the sensors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and images from the cameras <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and analyzes them to present information accessible to an operator. The information may be presented on a screen display <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in graphical or tabular form and may include comparisons with a stored design for the part, in the form of a computer-aided design (CAD) model for example, that serves as a template. Deviations from predetermined tolerances for selected characteristics of the part may be computed and presented. A keyboard or operator console <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> or other operator-controlled data input device allows an operator to select the presentation format and send the results to a printer or to other manufacturing equipment or to another computer station. The operator console <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> need not be located in physical proximity to the inspection machine. Remote connections, via the Internet, satellite or cellular communication technologies, enable the operator to control the inspection process from a distance. The operating system for computer system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may be any operating system, such as UNIX, DOS, WINDOWS, etc, which is compatible with the non-contact sensors and other original manufacturer equipment (OEM). Other computer architectures that may be used with the invention include a stand-alone computer, a computer communicating with an operator only, a computer communicating with another machine, a computer communicating with the production line, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The computer system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may also interface with the transceiver units of the entrance tag reader <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to receive the identification of the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which is written on the tag <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The computer system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> may also interface with the exit tag reader <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, which reads and writes information on the tag <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> exits. The information written on the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> at the exit <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the inspection apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include, for example, the inspection outputs from the sensors <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In addition or instead of the radio frequency identification system, a bar code system may be used, including a bar code reader <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> communicating with the computer system <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and reading a bar code tag <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> attached on the part <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or on the fixture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method and apparatus for control of optical trap arrays and formation of particle arrays using light that is in the visible portion of the spectrum. The method and apparatus provides a laser and a time variable diffractive optical element to allow dynamic control of optical trap arrays and consequent control of particle arrays and also the ability to manipulate singular objects using a plurality of optical traps. By avoiding wavelengths associated with strong absorption in the underlying material, creating optical traps with a continuous-wave laser, optimizing the efficiency of individual traps, and trapping extended samples at multiple points, the rate of deleterious nonlinear optical processes can be minimized. </paragraph>

<federal-research-statement>
<paragraph-federal-research-statement id="P-0001"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention was made with U.S. Government support under Contract No. DMR-9730189 awarded by the National Science Foundation, through the MRSEC Program of the National Science Foundation under Award No. DMR-9808595, and through a GAANN fellowship from the Department of Education. The U.S. Government also has certain rights to the invention.</paragraph-federal-research-statement>

<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed generally to a method and apparatus for control of optical traps or optical tweezers. More particularly, the invention is directed to optical tweezers formed using visible light that can be used to manipulate a variety of light sensitive materials, such as living biological materials, without substantial damage or deleterious effects upon the material being investigated or manipulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is known to construct optical tweezers using optical gradient forces from a single beam of light to manipulate the position of a small dielectric particle immersed in a fluid medium whose refractive index is smaller than that of the particle. The optical tweezer technique has been generalized to enable manipulation of reflecting, absorbing and low dielectric constant particles as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Some systems have therefore been developed which can manipulate a single particle by using a single beam of light to generate a single optical trap. To manipulate multiple particles with such systems, multiple beams of light must be employed. The difficulty of creating extended multiple-beam traps using conventional optical tweezer methodology inhibits their use in many potential commercial applications such as the inspection of biological materials generally, and also the fabrication and manipulation of nanocomposite materials including electronic, photonic and opto-electronic devices, chemical sensor arrays for use in chemical and biological assays, and holographic and computer storage matrices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An optical tweezer uses forces exerted by an intense and tightly focused beam of light to trap and manipulate dielectric particles, typically in fluid media. Prior descriptions of optical tweezers emphasized their potential utility for biological applications such as capturing cells, or their components, for research, diagnostic evaluation, and even therapeutic purposes. These same reports also emphasized the inherent and persistent occurrence of damage or changes caused by optical trapping methods when using visible light. In particular, it has been observed that green light of wavelength &lgr;&equals;514.5 nm from an Ar ion laser has caused various deleterious effects on biological material: red blood cells literally explode, the chloroplasts of green plant cells were destroyed, and the continued application of a green laser light has caused the death of trapped ciliated bacteria. Damage from the green laser light in the first two examples clearly resulted from strong absorption of green light by hemoglobin and chlorophyll, respectively, leading to rapid heating and catastrophic destruction. The mechanism of the third type of damage, dubbed &ldquo;opticution&rdquo; by those in the art, was not immediately obvious. Subsequent studies have identified optically-induced mutagensis to be a likely mechanism for the cells&apos; death by virtue of the use of optical tweezers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Considerably less damage to biological materials was observed when comparable materials were optically trapped with infrared light from a Nd:YAG laser operating at &lgr;&equals;1064 nm. Largely on the basis of these and similar early observations with a single optical tweezer, researchers came to the conclusion that infrared illumination is operationally superior to visible illumination for optically trapping biological materials. That is, use of infrared light did not cause any apparent deleterious effect upon biological material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Laser-induced damage can be desirable, however, in special circumstances. For example, pulsed optical tweezers operating at &lgr;&equals;532 nm have been singled out for their ability to cut biological materials, such as chromosomes. Optical tweezers used in this way are known as optical scissors or optical scalpels. Even so, the prospects for nondestructively trapping biological materials with visible light had previously been considered by those in the art to be an unacceptable method of optical trapping and manipulation due to the well documented and accepted deleterious effect on biological material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved method and system for using at least one optical trap from light in the visible or ultraviolet portion of the spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the invention to provide a novel method and apparatus for control of visible light optical traps that has an increased level of efficiency, effectiveness and safety for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the invention to provide a novel method and apparatus for control of visible light optical traps that is relatively simple to align by virtue of using light visible to the human eye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is still a further object of the invention to provide a novel method and apparatus for control of visible light optical traps where localized regions can be accurately trapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is an additional object of the invention to provide a novel method and apparatus for control of visible light optical traps wherein the samples being manipulated are not overly heated or otherwise altered due to light absorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a novel method and apparatus for control of optical traps wherein the optical traps have highly improved tracking accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is an another object of the invention to provide a novel method and apparatus for using visible light for optical tweezers for use on any material whose electronic, mechanical, chemical or biological state is highly sensitive to optical tweezers having a high intensity light pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the invention to provide a novel method and apparatus for control of optical traps with a variable power level which provides efficient optical trapping but without alteration of the desired chemical, biological, electronic or mechanical state of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the above objects, it has been discovered that damage or unwanted alterations inflicted by visible optical tweezers on biological matter, and other materials sensitive to high intensity light, can be reduced to acceptable, de minimis or even zero dimensions and levels, in part through appropriate design of the optical trapping system and method. In addition, it is believed that wavelengths in the ultraviolet can also be used for particular small size objects and particular types of materials by taking advantage of the features of this invention. Consequently, such optical tweezers can have widespread applications in biological systems and other systems having light sensitive materials and possess a number of advantages over infrared optical tweezers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order to best understand the improvement of the invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate several methods and systems which include some conventional features. In an optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, optical gradient forces arise from use of a single beam of light <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to controllably manipulate a small dielectric particle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> dispersed in a medium <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> whose index of refraction, n<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>, is smaller than that of the particle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fundamental nature of the optical gradient forces is well known, and also it is understood that the principle has been generalized to allow manipulation of reflecting, absorbing and low dielectric constant particles as well. Any of these techniques can be implemented in the context of the invention improvements described hereinafter and will be encompassed by use of the terminology optical tweezer, optical trap and optical gradient force trap hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is applied by using a light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (such as a laser beam or other very high intensity light sources) capable of applying the necessary forces needed to carry out the optical trapping effect needed to manipulate a particle. The objective of a conventional form of the optical tweezer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to project one or more shaped beams of light into the center of a back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of a converging optical element (such as an objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). As noted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a width &ldquo;w&rdquo; and having an input angle &Oslash; relative to an optical axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is input to a back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and output from a front aperture <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> substantially converging to a focal point <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in focal plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of imaging volume <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with the focal point <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> coinciding with an optical trap <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In general, any focusing optical system can form the basis for the optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the case of the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> being a collimated laser beam and having its axis coincident with the optical axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> enters the back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is brought to a focus in the imaging volume <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at the center point c of the objective lens focal plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When the axis of the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is displaced by the angle <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> with respect to the optical axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, beam axis <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the optical axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> coincide at the center point B of the back aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This displacement enables translation of the optical trap across the field of view by an amount that depends on the angular magnification of the objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The two variables, angular displacement &Oslash; and varying convergence of the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, can be used to form the optical trap at selected positions within the imaging volume <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A multiple number of the optical traps <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be arranged in different locations provided that multiple beams of light <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are applied to the back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the different angles &Oslash; and with differing degrees of collimation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In order to carry out optical trapping in three dimensions, optical gradient forces created on the particle to be trapped must exceed other radiation pressures arising from light scattering and absorption. In general this necessitates having the wave front of the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to have an appropriate shape at the back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. For example, for a Gaussian TEM<highlight><subscript>oo </subscript></highlight>input laser beam, the beam diameter w should substantially coincide with the diameter of the back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. For more general beam profiles (such as Gauss-Laguerre) comparable conditions can be formulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In another system in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> which includes some conventional features, the optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can translate the optical trap <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> across the field of view of the objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A telescope <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is constructed of lenses L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which establishes a point A which is optically conjugate to the center point B in the prior art system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> passing through the point A also passes through the point B and thus meets the basic requirements for performing as the optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The degree of collimation is preserved by positioning the lenses L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to optimize the transfer properties of the telescope <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In addition, the magnification of the telescope <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be chosen to optimize angular displacement of the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and its width w in the plane of the back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As stated hereinbefore, in general several of the light beams <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be used to form several associated optical traps. Such multiple beams <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be created from multiple independent input beams or from a single beam manipulated by conventional reflective and/or refractive optical elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment of an overall optical manipulation system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, arbitrary arrays of optical traps can be formed. A diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is disposed substantially in a plane <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> conjugate to back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Note that only a single diffracted output beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is shown for clarity, but it should be understood that a plurality of such beams <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be created by the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The input light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> incident on the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is split into a pattern of the output beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> characteristic of the nature of the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, each of which emanates from the point A. Thus the output beams <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> also pass through the point B as a consequence of the downstream optical elements described hereinbefore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is shown as being normal to the input light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but many other arrangements are possible. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> arrives at an oblique angle P relative to the optic axis <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and not at a normal to the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the diffracted beams <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> emanating from point A will form optical traps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in focal plane <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the imaging volume <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (seen best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). In this arrangement of the optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> an undiffracted portion <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the input light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be removed from the optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This configuration thus enables processing less background light and improves efficiency and effectiveness of forming optical traps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can include computer generated holograms which split the input light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into a preselected desired pattern. Combining such holograms with the remainder of the optical elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> enables creation of arbitrary arrays in which the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is used to shape the wavefront of each diffracted beam independently. Therefore, the optical traps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be disposed not only in the focal plane <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, but also out of the focal plane <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to form a three-dimensional arrangement of the optical traps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, also included is a focusing optical element, such as the objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (or other like functionally equivalent optical device, such as a Fresnel lens) to converge the diffracted beam <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to form the optical traps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Further, the telescope <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, or other equivalent transfer optics, creates a point A conjugate to the center point B of the previous back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is placed in a plane containing point A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, arbitrary arrays of the optical traps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be created without use of the telescope <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be placed directly in the plane containing point B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In the optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> either static or time dependent diffractive optical elements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be used. For a dynamic, or time dependent version, one can create time changing arrays of the optical traps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which can be part of a system utilizing such a feature. In addition, these dynamic optical elements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be used to actively move particles and matrix media relative to one another. For example, the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be a liquid crystal phase array undergoing changes imprinted with computer-generated holographic patterns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> system can be constructed to carry out continuous translation of the optical tweezer trap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A gimbal mounted mirror <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is placed with its center of rotation at point A. The light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is incident on the surface of the mirror <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and has its axis passing through point A and will be projected to the back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Tilting of the mirror <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> causes a change of the angle of incidence of the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> relative to the mirror <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and this feature can be used to translate the resulting optical trap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. A second telescope <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is formed from lenses L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which creates a point A&prime; which is conjugate to point A. The diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> placed at point A&prime; now creates a pattern of diffracted beams <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, each of which passes through point A to form one of the tweezer traps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in an array of the optical tweezers system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In operation of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the mirror <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> translates the entire tweezer array as a unit. This methodology is useful for precisely aligning the optical tweezer array with a stationary substrate to dynamically stiffen the optical trap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through small-amplitude rapid oscillatory displacements, as well as for any application requiring a general translation capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The array of the optical traps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also can be translated vertically relative to the sample stage (not shown) by moving the sample stage or by adjusting the telescope <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In addition, the optical tweezer array can also be translated laterally relative to the sample by moving the sample stage. This feature would be particularly useful for large scale movement beyond the range of the objective lens field of view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> the optical system is arranged to permit viewing images of particles trapped by the optical tweezers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A dichroic beamsplitter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, or other equivalent optical beamsplitter, is inserted between the objective lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the optical train of the optical tweezer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment the beamsplitter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> selectively reflects the wavelength of light used to form the optical tweezer array and transmits other wavelengths. Thus, the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> used to form the optical traps <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the back aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with high efficiency while light beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> used to form images can pass through to imaging optics (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An illustration of one application of an optical system is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>. The diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is designed to interact with the single light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to create a 4&times;4 array of collimated beams. A 100 mW frequency doubled diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm provides a Gaussian TEM<highlight><subscript>oo </subscript></highlight>form for the light beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> the field of view is illuminated in part by laser light backscattered by sixteen silica spheres trapped in the array&apos;s sixteen primary optical tweezers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The 1 &mgr;m diameter spheres are dispersed in water and placed in a sample volume between a glass microscope slide and a 170 &mgr;m thick glass coverslip. The tweezer array is projected upward through the coverslip and is positioned in a plane 8 &mgr;m above the coverslip and more than 20 &mgr;m below the upper microscope slide. The silica spheres are stably trapped in three-dimensions in each of the sixteen optical tweezers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> is shown the optically-organized arrangement of spheres {fraction (1/30)} second after the optical tweezers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (traps) were extinguished but before the spheres had time to diffuse away from the trap site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Adaptive Tweezer Mode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In various embodiments the basic optical trap modes described hereinbefore can be used in various useful methodologies. Furthermore, other embodiments include apparati and systems which can be constructed to apply these methods to enhance operation and use of the optical traps. In particular, the optical traps can be controlled and modified, and various embodiments employing these features are described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A variety of new uses and applications of optical traps can arise from time varying construction and dynamic change of optical trap configuration. In one form of the invention an array of optical traps can be advantageously manipulated in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In the illustrated optical system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> splits the collimated laser beam <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> into several (two or more) laser beams <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Each of the several laser beams <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are transferred into a separate optical trap in an object plane <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Each of these several laser beams <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are transferred to the back aperture <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the objective beam <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by action of a conventional optical arrangement, such as the telescope formed by the laser <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The objective lens <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> focuses each of these several beams <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In a preferred form of the invention a movable knife edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is disposed to be movable into the path of the several laser beams <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling selective blocking of any selected one(s) of the several laser beams to selectively prevent formation of a portion of the optical traps. Such a methodology and structure enables construction of any desired array of optical traps by use of appropriately designed knife edges or apertured knife edge structure and like such structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> An illustration of the use of such optical trap control methodology is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> wherein optical traps are formed by a holographic form of diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The movable knife edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can block all but one line <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of its optical traps, and by systematically moving the knife edge <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, each of the lines <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be established. This enables systematic filling of optical traps <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> with particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. This methodology allows filling of the optical traps <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> with a variety of different types of the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and also avoids the typical problem of the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> tending to fill preferentially the outer portions of an array of optical traps. Such preferential filling can block filling of the inner optical traps. This controlled formation of the optical traps also permits precision formation and change of optical trap arrangements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In addition to exerting detailed control over filling of an array of the optical traps <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, devices can be provided to accelerate filling of the optical traps. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is shown a functional block <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> indicative of a device to (1) output selected particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), (2) apply the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> under pressure differential (through electrophoresis or electro-osmosis), (3) apply a temperature gradient and (4) translate the entire optical trap array through a suspension containing the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in a manner like a fishing net. Experimentation has determined the particles <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be filled into the optical traps <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> starting with a particle concentration of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>&mgr;m<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>and a reasonable flow rate of about 100 &mgr;m/sec to fill one row of the line <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> or an array pattern in about one minute of time. A fully developed array of the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be made permanent by transferring the array onto a substrate or by gelling the fluid which is suspending the particles. Such a procedure also can allow construction of a large variety of different particle arrays and coupled arrays of the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Using the previously-described characteristics and functionalities of the optical traps <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, each of the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can also be further interrogated, imaged and manipulated for operational uses and investigative purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment the optical traps <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be dynamically changed responsive to a specific optical requirement, which can be effected by use of a computer program with desired instructional information such that one or more of the optical traps <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be used to modify, remove, or add particles at various optical trap sites or allow various manipulations of a single object. Further, one or more of the optical traps <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be moved and their character changed (such as changing the shape or strength of the trap) for dynamic manipulation of any object, such as a cell of a plant or animal. This can be particularly advantageous when manipulating a delicate structure or when there is need to perform complex manipulations of an object. Heretofore, such objects were handles by a single brute force trap which could cause damage to the object or not provide the degrees of freedom often needed to perform a desired function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In addition, in another process the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be dynamically sorted by size. One can also image an array of the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in the manner shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. A microscope <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can image the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and a personal computer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can identify the particles <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and calculate a phase only hologram <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (for the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) to trap said particles.

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Use of Light in the Visible and UV Spectrum </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, visible light tweezers can be used advantageously. In other forms of the invention, for particular sizes of materials matched to ultraviolet light or for uses which are less sensitive to ultraviolet light, the invention can also be expanded to wavelengths shorter than visible light, including ultraviolet light. Heretofore, tweezers for use in living biological material have been formed from infrared light for the reasons described hereinbefore. Optical tweezers in general can damage biological systems through at least three principal mechanisms: (1) mechanically disrupting physical interconnections; (2) heating; and (3) in the case of biomaterials, photochemical transformation of biomolecules (these are merely exemplary mechanisms and other mechanisms are possible). The first mechanism includes processes such as drawing into the optical trap the phospholipids constituting a membrane and then expelling them as micelles or vesicles. Such processes are inherent in the operation of optical tweezers and do not depend on the wavelength of light being used. These destructive processes can be minimized by using the least possible and most efficient trapping force for a given application. Heating results from absorption of the optical trapping photons, as typified by the destruction of hemoglobin-rich red blood cells by green laser light. Most biological materials, however, are essentially transparent to visible light and in fact absorb more strongly in the infrared. For example, water has an absorption coefficient of about &mgr;<highlight><subscript>&part;</subscript></highlight>&equals;3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>at &lgr;&equals;500 nm (visible range) compared with </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> &mgr;<highlight><subscript>&part;</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.1 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>at &lgr;&equals;1 &mgr;m (infrared range). Infrared based optical traps should therefore heat water some 300 times more efficiently than visible light based traps. The difference is far less pronounced for other components of biological systems. For example, most proteins and polysaccharides have molar absorption coefficients of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> &mgr;<highlight><subscript>&part;</subscript></highlight>&ap;0.1 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>/M for visible light and &mgr;<highlight><subscript>&part;</subscript></highlight>&ap;0.01 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>/M for infrared radiation. Hemoglobin is an exception, with a comparatively enormous molar absorption coefficient of &mgr;<highlight><subscript>&part;</subscript></highlight>&ap;10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>/M in the visible light part of the spectrum. In the absence of such a strong absorption condition, visible light should lead to no worse heating than infrared, and indeed may well be preferable because of the prevalence of water in biological systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Photochemical transformations proceed either through resonant absorption of one or more photons to a discrete molecular state, or through non-resonant absorption to a broad molecular band. Most relevant resonant transitions take place in the infrared (for vibrational transitions) to the visible (for electronic transitions). Most relevant resonant transitions depend so strongly on the frequency of light, however, that they are highly unlikely to be driven by the monochromatic light from any particular infrared or visible laser. Transitions to broad bands take place mostly in the ultraviolet end of the optical spectrum and so should not be driven either by infrared light or by visible light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Opticution&rdquo; (described hereinbefore) is believed to be driven principally by photochemistry, rather than by heating or mechanical disruption, and thus it is important to understand why visible (or ultraviolet in some cases) optical tweezers can result in deleterious effects on biological and other materials having similar photochemistry responses (or other optically driven events which lead to deleterious effects in any type of material, such as light sensitive chemical states, light sensitive electronic states or even sensitive mechanical structures at the microscopic level). Such materials can include, for example, small molecule drugs, doped semiconductors, high temperature superconductors, catalysts and low melting point metals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For example, living organisms&apos; resistance to photochemical degradation at visible wavelengths would appear to be a natural byproduct of their evolution in sunlight. However, the flux of visible light from the sun is smaller than that in a typical <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mW optical tweezer by some six orders of magnitude. The intense illumination at the focal spot of an optical tweezer greatly increases the rate of multiple-photon absorption in which two or more photons cooperate to drive a single optical transition. Multiple photon events require photons to arrive simultaneously, and so the level of occurrences of such events depend strongly on the light intensity. The strong focus of an optical trap does indeed provide the high-intensity light environment needed to drive such multiple photon processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Multiphoton absorption can be more damaging in visible tweezers than in infrared due to the simultaneous absorption of two visible photons which delivers the equivalent energy of a single ultraviolet photon. Likewise this can be extended to ultraviolet photons having wavelengths in which two or more such photons are required to deliver light energy which would alter the chemical, biological, electronic or mechanical state of a material. Two-photon absorption of infrared light, on the other hand, delivers the equivalent energy of a visible photon and therefore does not usually suffice to drive photochemical or like optical transformations. Achieving relevant photochemistry events with infrared light would therefore require three- or even four-photon absorption. Because higher-order absorption processes are less likely than lower order processes, visible optical tweezers appear to be more likely than infrared tweezers to induce deleterious photochemistry, such as chromosome recombinations in biological materials. This is believed to be the mechanism by which tightly focused pulses of light at &lgr;&equals;532 nm form an optical scalpel capable of precisely cutting chromosomes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The approximate rate W<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>of an n-photon absorption in the focal volume of an optical tweezer should scale as follows:

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> where P is the power in the beam and &sgr; is the photon capture cross-section for the absorber. As is shown by the above equation, lower-order processes at shorter wavelengths occur much more frequently than higher-order processes at longer wavelengths, at least for beams of equal power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Optical tweezers, however, are far more efficient when created with light of shorter wavelengths than infrared light (e.g., visible and in some cases ultraviolet). As a result, such optical tweezers require much less power to match the trapping force of infrared tweezers. This comparative advantage of such tweezers opens the door to their use for micromanipulation of biological materials (and for any other highly light sensitive materials as described hereinbefore). The magnitude of the optical gradient force drawing dielectric material to the focus of an optical trap scales roughly with the inverse fourth power of A in the Rayleigh approximation:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Therefore a visible trap operating at, for example, &lgr;&equals;532 nm requires only {fraction (1/16)} the power to achieve the same trapping force as an infrared trap operating at &lgr;&equals;1064 nm. The relative reduction in power immediately translates into a reduction in the rate W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of two-photon absorption events for the visible trap. Therefore, the likelihood of substantial damage is drastically reduced and can even enable infliction of virtually no damage to the subject material. Furthermore, by careful selection of the wavelength of light used (visible or even ultraviolet in some cases), absorption windows of a material being inspected can be used to select the wavelength of light to reduce the absorption of light and thereby reduce the damage or alteration of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The trapping efficiency of an optical tweezer can be increased still further, and the power requirements correspondingly reduced, by appropriately shaping the wavefront of the trapping beam. For example, it has previously been demonstrated that an optical trap constructed from a donut-mode laser beam whose intensity vanishes at the optical axis requires far less power to achieve the axial trapping force of a conventional optical tweezer formed with a Gaussian TEM<highlight><subscript>oo </subscript></highlight>mode. While it is clear that shaping the wavefront can improve trapping efficiency, thereby reducing two-photon absorption, no studies have reported an optimal wavefront profile. Therefore, still further improvements are available with engineering of the trapping wavefront&apos;s characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> While the time-averaged power establishes the trapping force of an optical tweezer, its peak power sets the rate of occurrence of two-photon processes. Consequently, continuous-wave visible optical tweezers should also be less damaging than traps derived from pulsed lasers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The local irradiation, and thus the rate of two-photon processes, can be reduced still further by applying multiple separate traps to a system, as described hereinbefore, rather than just one trap. Distributing the trapping force on an extended sample among N optical tweezers therefore reduces W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>by a factor of N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A system (biological or otherwise) with discrete photosensitive components can be further trapped with visible (or ultraviolet in some cases) light tweezers, provided that care is taken to position the light traps away from sensitive areas of the subject material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Further, some samples, such as many biological materials, absorb light strongly in the visible range and therefore cannot be trapped with visible optical tweezers. For the great number of systems largely transparent to visible light, various steps can be used to minimize the rate of deleterious nonlinear optical processes. Without limitation, these can include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> 1. Given a choice of a range of visible light wavelengths, one can avoid the use of light wavelengths associated with strong absorptions characteristic of the type of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> 2. One can create traps with a continuous-wave (CW) laser, rather than with a pulsed laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> 3. One can trap an extended sample at multiple points, rather than at just one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> 4. One can make each trap as efficient as possible. For example, one can take advantage of wavefront shaping to minimize the power required to achieve a desired trapping force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The concepts of creating traps with a continuous-wave (CW) laser and avoiding those associated with strong absorptions can be applied generically to all optical tweezer systems. Trapping extended samples at multiple points and maximizing the efficiency of each trap, however, could be more difficult to implement in conventional optical tweezer systems, but are well within the domain of intended uses of holographic optical tweezers. In particular, holographic optical tweezers (&ldquo;HOTs&rdquo;) can create an arbitrary number N of optical traps in arbitrary positions so as to trap an extended biological sample (or other highly light sensitive material) at multiple points. The simplest of these multiple trapping patterns also could be created by rapidly scanning a single tweezer among the desired array of traps. This can be particularly useful in biological samples, or other highly light sensitive materials, since not all of the power needs to be imparted on a single point of the sample. By instead distributing the power over a number of points, the overall damage to the sample will be significantly reduced in a manner similar to a &ldquo;bed of nails.&rdquo; Achieving a desired time-averaged trapping force in each of the N scanned traps, however, would require N times the peak power in each trap. Consequently, HOTs have an inherent advantage over scanned tweezers when it comes to trapping materials nondestructively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> HOTs also can produce more complex continuously evolving patterns of traps than can scanned-tweezer systems. This would be an advantage if optical tweezer manipulation is intended to move or sort biological or highly light sensitive materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Holographic optical tweezers also can tailor the wavefronts of the individual beams making up the array of traps and can direct each beam accurately into the trapping system&apos;s focusing optics. Consequently, optical tweezers formed with a HOT system can dynamically minimize the amount of power needed to achieve a desired trapping force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The above qualitative example guidelines can be used for minimizing the rate of radiation or other light initiated damage inflicted on biological systems (or other highly light sensitive materials) by optical trapping with visible light. By following these guidelines, it is possible to obtain acceptable small rate of damage for a particular application. The use of visible light in an HOT system would therefore have at least several advantages for applications to biological systems: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Optical efficiency. Microscope objective lenses suitable for forming optical tweezers typically are optimized for use at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths and suffer from a variety of defects when used to transmit infrared light. Trapping with visible light thus takes optimal advantage of the designed properties of conventional optics. Infrared systems, by contrast either must use more costly special-purpose optics, or else will suffer from optical aberrations which will somewhat diminish their potential benefits relative to visible trapping systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Safety. The human visual system includes a protective blink reflex which reduces the chance that a stray beam of light from a visible trapping system could damage a user&apos;s eyesight. No such reflex protects a user&apos;s vision in the infrared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Ease of alignment. Visible optical trains are much easier to align than infrared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Availability of two-photon processes. Two-photon processes can be useful in some biological applications, for instance in creating optical scissors and scalpels. The same optical train which creates damage-minimizing configurations of visible optical traps can be reconfigured in real time to produce individual beams optimized for two-photon absorption, but with maximum power usage efficiency. Thus the same system could trap, cut, and generally induce photochemical transformations in its samples using a single laser for excitation to for one or a matrix of optical traps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Reduced heating. Infrared systems probably heat their samples through direct absorption by water to a greater extent than do visible systems. This excess heating could explain some of the damage reported in infrared trapping experiments on living systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Improved trapping accuracy. The trapping volume of an optical tweezer scales with the wavelength of light. Visible light therefore can trap more accurately localized regions than infrared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Improved tracking accuracy. Optical traps sometimes are used to track the motions of trapped objects, for instance through the time evolution of the light scattered by trapped particles into the far field. The resolution of such tracking techniques scales with the wavelength of light and thus would be improved with traps formed in visible light relative to infrared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> It is also possible that a variety of biological and also nonbiological materials can be manipulated in a manner described above with varying wavelengths, laser types, and experimental conditions. The particular parameters that are used will be dependent upon the material to be manipulated and the optical, chemical, mechanical and electrical states which are sensitive to light. More particularly for example, the absorption characteristics of the material at certain wavelengths in the visible range may have a significant bearing on the wavelength of the laser beam used for the manipulation. For example, the use of certain types of green laser light can be successfully used with certain materials but not with others (such as chloroplasts in certain types of plants). For nonbiological materials, such as electronic devices, one can select visible light wavelengths which do not exhibit strong absorption by the components of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> It is also noted that the visible portion of the spectrum has often been considered to be in the range of about 400 nn to about 700 nm. It is possible, however, that a broader wavelength range could be used in accordance with the broader aspects of the invention. For example, the window of transparency for water is between about 200 nm and about 800 nm, and an even larger range could be used in certain situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The following non-limiting examples demonstrate the efficacy of visible optical tweezers for manipulating living biological samples. In particular, we have demonstrated long-term trapping using light at &lgr;&equals;532 nm using a frequency-doubled Nd:YVO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>laser. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to mesoporous aluminosilicate compositions which have a unique structure which are stable at high temperatures and under hydrothermal conditions. In particular, the present invention relates to a process for producing the mesoporous aluminosilicate composition which uses a zeolite seed with a structure directing agent. Further still, the present invention relates to novel cracking catalysts for oil and other organic molecules. The present invention thus provides for the assembly of ultrastable mesoporous aluminosilicates with hexagonal, cubic and wormhole framework structures that do not suffer from the undesirable extensive de-alumination and steam instability of conventional aluminosilicate mesostructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> All previously reported aluminosilicate mesostructures, as prepared by either direct or post synthesis alumination, results in the extensive de-alumination of the framework upon calcination (Ryoo, R., et al., Chem. Commun. 2225 (1997); and Luan, Z. H., et al., J. Phys. Chem. 99 10590 (1995)). This undesired property has been attributed to the hydrolysis of the framework Al by steam generated in the calcination process (Corma, A., et al., J. Catal. 148 569 (1994); and Luan, Z. H., et al., J. Phys. Chem. 99 10590 (1995)). Regardless of the mechanism responsible for the de-alumination process, the acid catalytic properties of these materials for organic chemical conversions is greatly compromised. Moreover, all previously reported aluminosilicate mesostructures completely lose their framework mesoporosity when exposed to steam at the temperatures normally encountered in the processing of petroleum catalysts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Soon after the discovery of mesoporous MCM-41 molecular sieves (Beck, J. S., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114 10834 (1992)), it was found that the incorporation of aluminum into the framework introduced mild acidic functionality, but the long range order and tetrahedral siting of the aluminum was compromised (Chen, C-Y., et al., Microporous Mater. 2 17 (1993); Borade, R. B., et al., Catal. Lett 31 267 (1994); Luan, Z. H., et al., J. Phys. Chem. 99 10590 (1995)), especially at intended aluminum loadings above about 8 mol %. Mild acidity and loss of structural integrity, together with poor steam stability under regeneration conditions made hexagonal Al-MCM-41 compositions unattractive candidates for the processing of high molecular weight petroleum fractions. More recently, important advances have been made in improving the structural integrity of Al-MCM-41 through direct assembly (Janicke, M. T., et al., Chem. Mater. 11 1342 (1999)) and post synthesis modification methods (Hamdan, H., et al., J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans 92 2311 (1996); Mokaya, R., et al., Chem. Commun. 2185 (1997); Ryoo, R., et al., J. Chem. Commun. 2225 (1997); and Ryoo, R., et al., Chem. Mater. 9 1607 (1998)). However, the low acidity and poor steam stability still limit potential applications in petroleum refining (Corma, A., Chem. Rev. 2373 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There is thus a need for improved aluminosilicate compositions that are stable, particularly in the presence of steam. In particular, the present invention relates to aluminosilicates that have stable framework structures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> This invention provides the structurally distinct families of mesoporous aluminosilicates that are stable solid acid catalysts under the harsh steaming conditions encountered in the regeneration of the catalyst in processes such as the refining of petroleum. This result has been achieved without added reagent or processing costs in comparison to the costs for producing conventional mesostructures. The large framework pore sizes (2.0-10.0 nm) make these new materials especially desirable as cracking catalysts or hydrocracking catalysts for the refining of &ldquo;heavy crudes&rdquo; containing very high molecular weight fractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The approach for making ultrastable aluminosilicate mesostructures is to prepare first a reaction mixture of nanometer-sized anionic aluminosilicate clusters that contain primarily four-coordinated aluminum and silicon as linked tetrahedral AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units. These nanoclustered aluminosilicate anions are then further linked into a mesoporous framework structure through supramolecular assembly reaction in the presence of a structure-directing surfactant, most preferably a quaternary ammonium ion surfactant. The surfactant can contain ammonium, phosphonium or arsonium ions in an organic molecule. The displacement of alkali metal ions, organic ions and surfactant from the as-made mesostructure provides a mesoporous structure with unique thermal and hydrothermal stability in comparison to previously disclosed aluminosilicate mesostructures. Most preferred are the mesoporous structures obtained by displacing the sodium ions, organic ions and most of the surfactant by treatment with a solution of ammonium ions (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>). The calcination of these NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>-exchanged forms of the compositions at temperatures above about 500&deg; C. removes residual surfactant and converts the ammonium ions to protons, thus affording a stable solid acid for catalyzing a variety of organic chemical conversions, especially alkylation reactions, isomerization reactions, cracking reactions, hydrocracking reactions, and hydrotreating reactions. The resulting acidic compositions can be easily incorporated as an active component of a conventional catalyst particle to improve catalytic conversions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In particular, an enhancement in the catalytic performance properties of FCC (fluidized bed catalytic cracking) particles can be expected by incorporating into the particle matrix the steam-stable mesoporous compositions of the present invention as a component capable of cracking a high fraction of the petroleum that comprises the resid or heavy end fraction of the petroleum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The nanoclustered aluminosilicate anions used to form the stable mesostructures of this invention are known in the art of zeolite chemistry as nucleating agents or, more generally, as &ldquo;zeolite seeds&rdquo;. They are given this term because they can be crystallized into a specific atomically ordered zeolite upon aging them as a solution, gel, or wet solid at elevated temperatures. In addition, some zeolite seeds can promote the nucleation and crystallization of a specific zeolite when they are added in small amounts to reaction mixtures of silicate and aluminate ions that would not normally form the desired zeolite of interest under equivalent conditions in the absence of the added seeds. In general, zeolite seeds can have two physical forms, namely, they can be in the form of sub-micrometer crystalline particles of the same zeolite that they nucleate, or they can be amorphous nanoclusters in solution, gel or solvent-suspended form. The sub-micrometer forms are often referred to as &ldquo;crystalline seeds&rdquo; whereas the amorphous nanoclustered forms are often called &ldquo;nucleating centers, gels, solutions, agents ,etc.&rdquo; For instance, Lechert et al. Stud. Surf. Sci. Catal., 84,147(1994) distinguishes between crystalline and amorphous gel forms of nucleating agents for type Y zeolites seeds. For the purposed of presenting the art of the present invention, however, we refer to both forms of these zeolite nucleating reagents as &ldquo;zeolite seeds&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; whether they are sub-micrometer crystals or amorphous nanoclusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Zeolite seeds are formed by aging mixtures of silicate anions and aluminate anions under conditions of basic pH and, normally, elevated temperatures in the presence of specific inorganic and organic cations. The cations are selected so that they act. as &ldquo;templates&rdquo; or, more precisely, as structure directors in forming the seeds. For example, the use of inorganic cations to form seeds of zeolite Y, more precisely the seeds of faujasitic zeolites, has been disclosed by Robson ACS Sym. Ser., 398,436 (1989), by Vaughan et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,178,352 (1979), Lechert et al, Stud. Sur. Sci. Catal., 84, 147 (1994), and by U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,574,538 and 3,808,326 to McDaniel et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,191 to Maher et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,789,107 to Elliott. The. use of organic cations to form seeds of many different families of zeolites have been described by Lok et al. Zeolites, 3, 282 (1983); J. N. Watson et al. J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. (94) 2181 (1998); P. P. E. A. deMoor, et al. Chem. Mater. (11) 36 (1999); P. P. E. A. de Moor, et al. J. Phys. Chem. B (103) 1639 (1999) and S. I. Zones et al., Microporous Mesoporous. Mater. 21, 199(1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The structures of amorphous nanoclustered seeds is unknown, but it is presumed that the nanoclusters contain linkages of SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra that resemble the secondary building blocks found in crystalline zeolites. These secondary building blocks may contain rings of a specific number of space filling oxygen atoms that bridge the tetrahedrally coordinated silicon and aluminum centers, such as single and double 4-rings, 5-rings, 6-rings, and the like. Whatever the structure or connectivity of the SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units in nanoclustered aluminosilicate seeds may be, they are powerful structure-directing reagents in the nucleation of zeolite phases. The nanoclusters may be regarded as being &ldquo;proto-zeolitic&rdquo; by bearing a structure or tetrahedral building block connectivity that readily promotes zeolite crystallization. The art of the present invention discloses that these same protozeolitic seeds are preferred precursors for the supramolecular assembly of highly stable mesostructured aluminosilicate molecular sieves, even though the framework walls remain largely disordered in comparison to the atomically well-ordered framework walls of conventional zeolites. However, we do not exclude from the disclosed art the use of crystalline sub-micron zeolite seeds as precursors to the assembly of stable mesostructured aluminosilicate molecular sieves. Such small crystalline zeolite seeds can be transformed, at least in part, into stable framework wall-forming substructures under the conditions used to assemble a mesostructure. In addition, crystalline zeolite seeds may be admixed with amorphous nanoclustered seeds. Indeed, the residual crystalline zeolite seeds could even become embedded in the walls of the stabilized aluminosilicate mesostructures formed from the amorphous cluster fraction of the seed precursors. Mesostructures with such biphasic walls could have useful properties as catalysts for size dependent sequential chemical conversions, such as the cracking reactions involved in the refining of petroleum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The structural order, acidity and steam stability of hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructures all can be substantially improved through the assembly of nanoclustered precursors that normally nucleate the crystallization of microporous zeolites, particularly zeolites type Y and ZSM-5. These zeolite seeds are presumed to promote zeolite nucleation by adopting AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra connectivities that resemble the secondary structural elements in a crystalline zeolite. Assembling these same zeolite seeds into a mesostructure imparts acidity and hydrothermal stability that begin to approach zeolites, even though the framework walls remain in large part atomically disordered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The assembly of hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructures from zeolite seeds according to the teachings of this invention is not limited to zeolite Y formed from inorganic cations or to ZSM-5 seeds formed from organic cations. Any zeolite seed composition can be used to form aluminosilicate mesostructures with a hydrothermal stability that is substantially improved in comparison to the same mesostructures prepared from conventional precursors. The literature discloses numerous examples of organic molecules and ions that organize (or &ldquo;template&rdquo;) silicate and aluminate anions into nanoclustered units that seed the nucleation of crystalline zeolites (see, for example, B. M. Lok, et al. Zeolites (3) 282 (1983); R. E. Boyett, et al., Zeolites (17) 508 (1996); S. I. Zones,. et al. Microporous Mesoporous Mater. (21) 199 (1998)). All of these zeolite seed compositions formed from organic templating agents are preferred precursors for the surfactant-directed supramolecular assembly of aluminosilicate mesostructures with enhanced hydrothermal stabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The assembly of zeolite seeds, particularly amorphous nanoclustered seeds, into a mesoporous framework causes the framework aluminum to remain in large part tetrahedral as AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units even after calcination. Also, the siting of the aluminum is more like that found in a hydrothermally stable zeolite, as indicated by the aluminum nmr chemical shift. By doing so, up to 35 mol % aluminum can be easily incorporated into hexagonal and wormhole silicate frameworks, denoted MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>and MSU-S<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>, respectively. Up to 13% Al was incorporated into cubic silicate mesostructures, denoted MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>. More importantly, at least half and more typically more than 75% or even 90% of the aluminum sites remain tetrahedral after calcination at 540&deg; C. Also the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-NMR chemical shift, as well as the shape and width of the resonance, was very similar to that of microporous zeolite Y. These latter results indicate that the local structure of the aluminum is analogous to that found in one of the most stable and most widely used zeolites in the petrochemical industry. Thus, these new ultrastable mesostructures with pore sizes in the range 2.0 to 15 nm are very useful for many applications where zeolite Y and other zeolites cannot be used because of a limited pore size below 1.0 nm. In addition, the structures remain stable even after treatment in 20% steam at 800&deg; C. for up to 5 hours, making them suitable for cracking or hydrocracking of high molecular weight petroleum fractions that cannot be processed by zeolite Y. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructures with Si/Al ratios in the range 80-2.0 have been assembled from aluminosilicate nanoclusters that normally nucleate the crystallization of zeolites type Y and ZSM-5. The aluminum content can be made very low in the case of ZSM-5 seeds increasing the Si/Al ratio to a value of 1000 and beyond. The calcined hexagonal mesostructures of this invention, denoted <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, are well-ordered, and structurally stable when exposed to 20% steam at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours. Al MAS NMR chemical shifts indicate that, unlike mesostructures assembled from conventional precursors, the mean Al&mdash;O&mdash;Si angle is similar to the value found for many crystalline zeolites. The steam stability of 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, together with an intrinsic acidity sufficient to crack cumene over the temperature range 300-450&deg; C., suggests that nanoclustered zeolite seeds are promising precursors for the design of hydrothermally stable mesostructures for the acid-catalyzed processing of high molecular weight petroleum fractions that cannot be adequately refined over microporous zeolites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Three structurally relevant properties embody the stable mesostructured aluminosilicate compositions of this invention from previously disclosed mesostructures. In the first general structural embodiment of the invention, the preferred compositions prepared from zeolite seeds have an experimentally observed <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift in the range 57-65 ppm relative to an aqueous 1.0 M aluminum nitrate as an external chemical shift reference. This is the chemical shift range that is found for many crystalline zeolite, including zeolite Y and other faujasitic zeolites. All previously reported mesostructured aluminosilicates prepared from conventional silicate and aluminate precursors, including the original Al-MCM-41. compositions of Beck et al., exhibit a chemical shift of-53-56 ppm. Chemical shift values in the range of 57-65 ppm are indicative of a zeolite-like connectivity of the SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and the AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units that comprise the framework walls of the mesostructures, even though the framework walls are largely disordered. We postulate that the zeolitic connectivity of the said tetrahedral units contributes substantially to the improvement in the hydrothermal stability of these preferred mesostructured compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the second structural embodiment, the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shifts of the preferred compositions fall in the range of previously disclosed mesostructured aluminosilicate compositions, namely, 53-56 ppm, but are distinguish by the presence of an infrared adsorption band in the frequency range 500-600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and by the retention of at least 80% of the initial framework mesopore volume is retained when the composition is exposed to boiling water for 5 hours or to 20% steam at 600&deg; C. for 5 hours. The infrared band at 500-600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>is indicative of the presence of zeolite-like secondary building blocks (e.g., 5-membered or 6-membered ring structures ) in the amorphous framework walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the third structural embodiment, the preferred aluminosilicate compositions of this invention are free of sodium exchange cations, exhibit a zeolite-like <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift in the range 57 to 65 ppm, and contain between 0.01 and 10 wt % carbon embedded in the framework mesopores. The sodium ions in the as-made mesostructures are displaced by ion exchange reaction with an ammonium salt, most preferably ammonium nitrate, in aqueous solution in the presence of the structure directing surfactant in the framework mesopores This exchange reaction also displaces a substantial amount of surfactant from the mesopores. Subsequent to the ion exchange reaction with ammonium ions, the mesostructure is calcined in air at a temperature sufficient to remove the remaining surfactant and to convert the ammonium exchange ions to protons, most preferably at a temperature of 540&deg; C. for a period of about 5 hours. This calcination procedure converts some of the remaining framework surfactant to carbon, presumably through cracking reactions of the surfactant in the acidic mesopores of the framework. The embedded carbon, which can amount to 0.01 to 10 wt % of the calcined mesostructure depending on calcination conditions, plays an important role in the hydrothermal stability of the mesostructures, presumably by reinforcing the framework against collapse under hydrothermal conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In view of the importance of the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift measurements in characterizing the preferred compositions of this invention, we briefly describe the measurement of this diagnostic parameter. In magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiment, the energy levels of the magnetic nucleus are split by the imposed magnetic field. Transitions between these energy levels are made to occur through the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the radio frequency range, typically the megahertz range. The absorption of the electromagnetic radiation gives rise to a &ldquo;resonance&rdquo; line at a frequency that is energetically equivalent to the energy separation between the magnetic energy levels for the nucleus under investigation. The sample is spun at an angle to the imposed magnetic field (the so-called magnetic angle) to average-out dipolar interactions that can broaden the resonance lines and complicate the spectrum. Because the electrons surrounding the nucleus contribute to the magnetic field experienced by the nucleus, the resonance frequency is dependent on the chemical environment. Thus, the resonance frequency &ldquo;shifts&rdquo;, depending on the chemical environment. These &ldquo;chemical shifts&rdquo; in the resonance frequency are recorded in &ldquo;parts per million&rdquo; (ppm) frequency units relative to the frequency of a reference compound with a known chemical environment and an arbitrarily assigned chemical shift of 0 ppm. The magnitude of the chemical shift is often used to deduce information on the chemical environment of the nucleus in the chemical compound being studied by MAS NMR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In the case of quadrupolar <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al nuclei, the splitting of the nuclear energy levels is determined by the nuclear magnetic spin quantum number 1&equals;5/2. The observed MAS NMR spectrum is typically dominated by the (&plus;&frac12;, &minus;&frac12;) central transition. The experimentally observed chemical shift for the resonance line corresponding to this transition can be influenced by quadrupolar interactions of the nucleus with the electric field gradient at the nucleus. Generally speaking, the observed <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shifts are too small and should be corrected for quadrupolar interactions to obtain the true values of the chemical shifts. However, if the electric field gradient at the nucleus is small, then the error in the observed resonance position for the (&plus;&frac12;, &minus;&frac12;) transition also is small (about 1 ppm or so in error) and no correction in the observed chemical shift is needed, especially if the differences in the chemical shifts being compared are much larger than the error caused by quadrupolar effects. This is typically the case for the AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra in most zeolites and related aluminosilicates (see Lippmaa et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 108 1730 (1986)), as well as for the Al(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight> cations that are used as the chemical shift reference in <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al NMR spectroscopy. For this reason, the chemical shifts reported here and in the literature for aluminosilicate mesostructures are not corrected for quadrupolar effects. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In order to have a contrast example for our newly invented aluminosilicate mesoporous molecular sieves, we prepared a conventional (well-ordered ) hexagonal MCM-41 aluminosilicate molecular sieve in which the overall Si/Al molar ratio was 49/1. This Example 1 sample is denoted 2% Al-MCM-41. The synthesis recipe was as follows: a solution containing the appropriate amounts of sodium aluminate (NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and sodium silicate solution was mixed, and then the required amount of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>acid was added under stirring to obtain a clear solution. Next, the required amount of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide in water was added and the mixture was stirred vigorous at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The resultant mixture was aged without stirring in a teflon lined autoclave at 100&deg; C. for 2 days. The product was recovered by filtration and thoroughly washing with deionized water. The molar composition for this particular synthesis was: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The sample after calcination at 650 degrees centigrade exhibited a BET surface area of 1037 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g, a total pore volume of 0.77 cc/g and an effective pore size of 33 &angst; as determined from the Horvath-Kawazoe model. The X-ray diffraction pattern exhibited three diffraction lines with d-spacings at 43.2, 24.9, and 21.6 &angst; and corresponding to the (100), (110) and (200) reflections, respectively, of a hexagonal mesostructure. The <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>AL-NMR spectrum for this particular sample is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In agreement with the findings reported by Corma and his coworkers, the MCM-41 aluminosilicate mesostructure prepared by this procedure has about &frac13; of the Al-sites in octahedral coordination and the remainder in tetrahedral coordination after calcination. The tetrahedral Al-sites exhibited a chemical shift at 53 ppm relative to 1.0 M aluminum nitrate solution, whereas the chemical shift for the aluminum in octahedral sites was 0 to 10 ppm. These chemical shifts are in agreement with the typical literature values (i.e. 53&tilde;56 ppm for tetrahedral aluminum and &tilde;0.0 ppm for octahedral aluminum for a conventional Al-MCM-41. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 TO 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> These two examples illustrate according to the teachings of the present invention the preparation of mesoporous aluminosilicates with hexagonal, cubic, and wormhole framework structures that are steam-stable in comparison to like mesostructure compositions obtained from conventional aluminosilicate precursors. The preferred aluminosilicate precursors of this invention contain nanosized aggregates in which the aluminum is in tetrahedral coordination and linked through bridging oxygen atoms to silicon tetrahedra that in are largely in Q<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>connectivity to other silicon tetrahedra. By Q<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>connectivity we mean that the SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedron is linked through bridging oxygens to four adjacent tetrahedra that are occupied by silicon and aluminum. These nanosized aluminosilicate precursors also are capable of promoting the crystallization of atomically ordered zeolite phases when mixed with suitable gels and aged under hydrothermal conditions. Owing to their ability to nucleate zeolitic phases, such as zeolites type Y (more precisely faujasitic zeolites) and ZSM-5 (more precisely MFI zeolites, these highly cross-linked precursors are often referred to as &ldquo;zeolite seeds&rdquo;. Therefore, the aluminosilicate precursor of Example 2 is referred to here as a &ldquo;type Y seeds&rdquo; composition, because it is. known to promote the crystallization of Type Y zeolite. Likewise, the cross-linked aluminosilicate precursor of Example 3 is referred to here as &ldquo;ZSM-5 seeds&rdquo;, because the precursor is known to nucleate the crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolite. However, in this example we use these zeolite seeds as precursors to mesoporous molecular sieve aluminosilicates with atomically disordered (amorphous) walls, but with a hexagonal, cubic or wormhole pore structure that sufficiently order on a mesoscopic length scale to exhibit correlation (Bragg) peaks in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The type Y seeds composition of Example 2, which contained 10 mole % aluminum (Si/Al&equals;9/1), was prepared in the following manner. A NaOH aqueous solution with 0.088 mole NaOH and 8.5 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was prepared and 0.10 mole NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was added to this NaOH solution under stirring until a clear solution formed. To this basic sodium aluminate solution was added 1.0 mole of sodium silicate from a 27 wt % sodium silicate solution under vigorous stirring until a homogeneous opalescence gel formed. To obtain the Y-seeds composition, the gel was sequentially aged at ambient temperature over night and then at 100&deg; C. over night. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The 5% Al-ZSM-5-seeds composition corresponding to Example 3 was prepared from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as the silicon source and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as the template for ZSM-5 seed formation. TEOS (1.0 mole) was mixed with 0.22 mole of 1.0 M TPAOH to obtain a clear solution under mild heating. Then 0.05 mole aluminum sec-butoxide was added to obtain an opaque solution. The solution was diluted with 127 mole water and aged at 85&deg; C. for 3 days to produce a clear ZSM-5 seeds solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> 27Al-MAS NMR spectra of the above Type Y and ZSM-5 seeds compositions were recorded on a Varian VRX 400S instrument in a zirconia rotor at spinning speeds of 2 kHz and 900 Hz, respectively. The spectra are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> provides the X-ray diffraction pattern of the 10% Al-Y-seeds obtained by smearing the Y-seeds gel on a glass plate in the absence (bottom) or the presence of ethanol (top) to help promote the aggregation of the aluminosilicate precursor. The single <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al NMR lines with chemical shifts of 55 and 59 ppm correspond to aluminum in a zeolite-like tetrahedral environment. In other words, the aluminosilicate species in the precursor compositions exhibit an NMR pattern consistent with the presence of nano-sized aluminosilicate clusters, as reported in the literature (White et al, <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. </italic></highlight>1998, 94, 2181; van Santen et al, <highlight><italic>Chem. Mater. </italic></highlight>1999, 11, 36). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The following examples will illustrate the use of these nano-clustered zeolite seeds as precursors for the assembly of aluminosilicate mesostructures with hexagonal, cubic, and wormhole frameworks that are ultrastable under steaming conditions in comparison to mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves prepared from conventional precursor solutions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 4 TO 6 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> These three examples were designed to illustrate the use of nanoclustered zeolite seeds according to art of the present invention for the preparation of mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves with long range hexagonal order even at high tetrahedral aluminum concentrations in the framework. The hexagonal order is retained even after the mesostructures have been calcined to remove the surfactant. These mesostructures also exhibited a <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>AL-NMR resonance with a chemical shift substantially greater than 56 ppm, indicating a more zeolitic connectivity of SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units in the framework walls. This minimum chemical shift value for our new aluminate mesostructures is larger than the previously reported literature values for all known aluminated derivatives of silica mesostructures, regardless of the long range structural order of the mesostructure or the method used to form the aluminated derivatives. Moreover, the aluminum NMR chemical shifts for our new aluminosilicate mesostructures are comparable to the values typically observed for the siting of aluminum centers of crystalline zeolites, including steam stable HY zeolite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates how the art of the present invention overcomes the destructive effect of direct aluminum incorporation that is normally encountered in the assembly of a mesoporous aluminosilicate with long range hexagonal order.

In this example, tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) in place of CTAB as the structure director. A reaction mixture containing 0.25 mole TTAB as the surfactant structure director and a 20 mol % Al type Y zeolite aluminosilicate precursor was prepared and processed in the same way as described in Examples 4 to 6.

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> These two examples were designed to demonstrate the art of the present invention for the preparation of our new aluminosilicate mesostructures with long range cubic order, which we denote as Al-MSU-Sc. These cubic compositions also exhibit tetrahedral <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-NMR resonances at chemical shifts greater than 56 ppm and similar to the chemical shift of HY zeolite. Two cubic mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves with Al contents of 2 mol %, and 10 mol % were prepared corresponding to examples 8 and 9, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> To obtain the said cubic mesostructures, gel-like zeolite type Y aluminosilicate seed precursors with the appropriate Al content were obtained according to Example 2 and diluted with 127 mole water. For each mole of silicon used in the reaction mixture, the diluted gel was first treated with 0.044 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to lower the pH. Then 0.12 mole CTAB and 3.0 mole ethanol was sequentially added under vigorous stirring at ambient temperature. After being stirred for 40 minutes the pH of the reaction mixture was reduced with the addition of 0.14 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The resulting mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 150&deg; C. for 15 h. The as-made products were recovered by filtration, air-dried and then calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove the surfactant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the top diffraction pattern is for the calcined 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>sample prepared from type Y zeolite seeds as described in Example 9. The bottom diffraction pattern is for 2% Al-MCM-48 as a contrast sample (Example 10). This contrast sample was prepared from conventional precursors by mixing diluted sodium silicate (1.0 mole) and sodium aluminate (0.02 mole) and NaOH (0.088 mole) solutions to obtain a clear solution and then reducing the pH immediately with 0.18 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. Then, 0.12 mole CTAB and 3 mole ethanol per mole of silicon was sequentially added under vigorously stirring at ambient temperature before transferring the reaction mixture to a Teflon-lined autoclave to age at 150&deg; C. for 15 h. The product was then washed and calcined at 540&deg; C. to remove the surfactant. This same procedure afforded a well-ordered cubic MCM-48-like silica when the aluminum was omitted from the reaction mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> It is clear from the XRD pattern for the calcined 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>mesostructure in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> that a well ordered cubic mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves was obtained from type Y zeolite seeds as the inorganic precursor. In contrast, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also shows that the calcined 2% Al-MCM-48 mesostructure prepared from conventional sodium aluminate, sodium silicate precursors and surfactant is disordered as judged from the broad low angle x-ray reflections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-NMR spectra of 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>from Example 8 and 2% Al-MCM-48 from Example 10 are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The zeolite-like resonance at a chemical shift of 62 ppm clearly indicates the exclusive presence of tetrahedral Al-sites for the cubic 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>. An analogous result was obtained for the cubic 10%-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>mesostructure prepared in Example 9. However, the resonance for the tetrahedra aluminum in 2% Al-MCM-48 occurs at a chemical shift of 56 ppm. In addition, this latter mesostructure exhibits a resonance (indicated by the arrow) at 0 ppm corresponding to octahedral Al-sites. Consequently, we can conclude that pre-formation of aluminosilicate nanocluster indeed improves the long range order of cubic mesostructures as well as the Al-sitting in these mesoporous molecular sieves. The BET surface area (and pore volume) measured from N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>adsorption isotherms for the MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>samples prepared from Example 8 and 9 were 976 (0.70) and 599 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g (0.51 cc/g). The effective pore size calculated from the Hovarth-Kawazoe model was 26 &angst; for both samples. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> These two examples were designed to illustrate the versatility of using pre-formed aluminosilicate nanoclusters to assemble wormhole-like mesoporous molecular sieves, denoted MSU-S<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>, with zeolite-like tetrahedral Al-sites (as judged from <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al NMR chemical shifts), as well as textural porosity that is useful for catalysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Example 11 made use of preformed Zeolite Y (faujasitic) seeds as described in Example 2. Example 12 made use of preformed ZSM-5 seeds as described in Example 3. In Example 11 a 10% Al-containing seeds composition was prepared as described in Example 2 and then 0.073 mole CTAB was added per mole of Si under vigorously stirring at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The resultant mixture was aged at 100&deg; C. for 2 days and the product was filtered, washed and air-dried. For Example 12, a clear 5% Al-ZSM-5 seeds solution obtained as described in Example 3 and then 0.073 mole CTAB per mole silica was added at ambient temperature under stirring. The resultant mixture was aged at 100&deg; C. for 2 days and the product was recovered by filtration, washed and air-dried. The surfactant in the samples obtained from Examples 11 and 12 was removed from the framework pores by calcination at 540&deg; C. in air for 7 h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> show the TEM images obtained for the MSU-S<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>samples prepared in examples 11 and 12. The images were recorded on a JEOL 100CX instrument with an electron beam accelerated at 120 kV using CeB<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>gun. The samples were dusted onto a copper-grid to obtain the images. Both wormhole-like framework pore channels and intraparticle textural mesopores are observed for both samples. The textural pores result from the intergrowth of nanoscale framework domains of primary particles. In agreement with the textural porosity evident in the TEM images, the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>adsorption-desorption isotherms, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> for the calcined materials, exhibit a large amount of textural porosity as evidenced by the hysteresis loop at partial pressures above 0.80. The filling of the framework wormhole pores is indicated by the step in the adsorption isotherms at partial pressures between 0.25 and 0.45. In agreement with a wormhole framework structure, the X-ray diffraction patterns (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) for the calcined aluminosilicate mesoporous molecular sieves of examples 11 and 12 contain a single intense X-ray diffraction line corresponding to the correlation length between the wormhole pores and a weak higher order refectin at higher scattering angle. Also, the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>AL-NMR spectra for these two wormhole mesostructures exhibited a zeolitic chemical shift at &tilde;61 ppm, in accord with the shifts observed for the samples prepared in Example 4 to 6. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 13 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The purpose for this example was to show that the aluminosilicate mesostructures prepared from nanoclustered zeolite seeds according to the present art are capable of surviving exposure to steam at 800&deg; C., at least when the structures are free of sodium ions and surfactant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Samples of 10% Al-MSU-S and 20% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, were prepared from nanoclustered zeolite Y type seeds according to the general procedure described in Examples 4-6. One-gram quantities of each as-made sample were separately treated with 100 ml 0.1 M NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>aqueous solution at 100&deg; C. for overnight. The treated samples were recovered by filtration and calcined at 540&deg; C. in air for 7 hours to remove the surfactant in the mesopores. These calcined samples were used for steam stability testing. Each sample was steamed at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours in the a stream of 20 vol % steam-containing N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Then the X-ray diffraction patterns and nitrogen adsorption isotherms were used to investigate the retention of a mesoporous structure after steaming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is obvious that the aluminosilicate mesostructures formed from preformed aluminosilicate nanoclusters retained their hexagonal structural integrity entirely, but the conventional MCM-41 like hexagonal mesostructure collapsed after steaming treatment at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours. This is in agreement with what has been reported previously by Ryoo and his co-workers (Ryoo, J. Phys. Chem. 1995, 99, 16742) regarding the stability of MCM-41 prepared from conventional precursors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Chemical analysis of the calcined samples before steaming indicated the presence of about 0.8% carbon. Samples calcined for periods longer or shorter periods than eight hours contained quantities of carbon lower than or greater than the 0.8 wt % value, respectively. Also, the degree to which the samples retained a hexagonal X-ray pattern and a framework mesoporosity after steaming generally paralleled the carbon content. Thus, we conclude that the framework embedded carbon, as well as the zeolite-like connectivity of the framework walls contributes to the steam stability of these materials. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 14 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The purpose of this example was to prepare a so-called ultrastable Al-MCM-41 sample according to the preparation art of R. Mokaya, as described in <highlight><italic>Angew.Chem.Int.Ed. </italic></highlight>1999, 38 No.19, 2930. A 1.0 g calcined sample of a &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; MCM-41 silica was prepared according to the methodology of Mokaya (see below). To this secondary silica was add 50 ml of aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH) solution (0.48 M with respect to Al) and the mixture was stirred at 80&deg; C. for 2 h. The resulting solid was collected by filtration and washed with 100 ml distilled water until it was free of Cl ions, dried at room temperature, and calcined in air at 550&deg; C. for 4 h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In accord with the teachings of Mokaya, in order to prepare a &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; MCM-41 silica, we first prepared a &ldquo;primary&rdquo; MCM-41 silica. To obtain the primary MCM-41 silica, 2.0 g of fumed silica was added to a solution containing 3.0 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 0.610 g tetramethyl-ammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) in 24 g H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O at 35&deg; C. under stirring for 1 h. After further stirring for 1 h, the resulting synthetic gel of molar composition 1.SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; 0.25 CTAB: 0.2TMAOH; 40H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was left to age 20 h at room temperature then the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150&deg; C. for 48 h. The solid product was obtained by filtration, washed with distilled water, dried in air at room temperature and calcined at 550&deg; C. for 8 h. The &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; MCM-41 silica was then prepared from the primary MCM-41 silica. To prepare the secondary MCM-41, a synthesis gel of same molar ratio was prepared, except that the primary calcined MCM-41 was used as silica source instead of fumed silica. The synthetic procedures were identical to the described for the primary synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The procedure for the steam stability test was as follows: 0.2 g of ultra stable MCM-41 was put into a Y-shaped quartz tube reactor and a stream of 20 vol % steam in N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was introduced at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours. The 20% water steam in N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was generated using a saturator. The X-ray diffraction patterns and N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-sorption and desorption isotherms were used to evaluate the residual structure after steaming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> As shown by the X-ray and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>adsorption data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A, 11B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C, the ultrastable MCM-41 of Mokaya underwent structural collapsed after the steaming treatment at 800&deg; C. for 5 and the surface area was reduced by 92% to 62 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g by steaming. Also, the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR spectrum in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows that only about half the aluminum is in tetrahedral environments (&tilde;51 ppm) and the other half is in octahedral environments (&tilde;0 ppm). We conclude that this material lacks the desired stability for many practical applications in acid catalysis, especially catalytic cracking. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Example 15 describes the synthesis and properties of a typical hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructure., &excl;0% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>(Si:Al&equals;9:1), derived from seeds that normally nucleate the crystallization of faujasitic zeolite type Y. The procedure used here for forming the zeolite type Y seeds follows the general methodology described in the literature (Robson, H. ACS Symp. Ser. 398 436 (1989); and Lechert, L., et al., Stud. Surf. Sci. Catal. 84 147 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Example 16 describes the preparation of a 10% Al-MCM-41 from convention silicate and aluminate precursors by eliminating the zeolite seeds&mdash;forming step used in the preparation of the 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>in Example 15. We then compare on the basis of XRD and nitrogen adsorption properties the steam stabilities of these two mesostructures. In addition, we include in the comparison of steam stability the &ldquo;ultrastable&rdquo; Al-MCM-41 prepared as described in Example 14 using the method of Mokaya. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>of Example 15 was prepared as follows. First, 0.269 g NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was dissolved in a solution of 0.116 g of NaOH in 5.0 ml water to obtain a clear solution. To this solution was added 7.29 g of sodium silicate solution (27 wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 14 wt % NaOH) under vigorous stirring to obtain a homogeneous mixture. To generate faujasitic type Y zeolite seeds, the resulting mixture was aged at room temperature overnight and then an additional 24 hour period at 100&deg; C. under static conditions. The mixture of zeolite seeds was diluted with 75 ml of water to obtain a milky suspension. Concentrated sulfuric acid (0.142 g) was added to the seeds mixture, followed by the addition of 2.45 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) under vigorous stirring for 30 minutes. Then an additional 0.781 g of sulfuric acid was added and the mixture was allowed to age at 100&deg; C. under static conditions overnight. Following this aging step additional increments of 0.156 g and 0.781 g of sulfuric acid were added and the mixture was again allowed to age at 100&deg; C. overnight under static conditions to form the mesostructure. At this point the pH of the reaction mixture was about 9.0 The resulting 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>product prepared from zeolite seed precursors was filtered, washed, and dried at ambient temperature in air. A 1.0-g quantity of the air-dried product was treated with 100 ml of 1.0M NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>at 100&deg; C. overnight to displace sodium ions and about half of the surfactant from the mesopores, dried in air, and then calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove remaining surfactant and to convert charge-balancing ammonium ions to protons. Chemical analysis of the calcined product indicated a Si:Al molar ratio of 9:1, along with the presence of 0.80 wt % carbon. We attribute the formation of carbon to the cracking of surfactant in the very acidic mesopores of the zeolite-like framework of the hexagonal MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>mesostructure during calcination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The 10% Al-MCM-41 comparative sample of Example 16 was prepared as follows. A mixture of 0.269 g of NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 7.29 g of sodium silicate (27 wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 14 wt % NaOH) were stirred vigorously to form a homogeneous mixture and then 75 ml of water was added to form a milky suspension. To the milky suspension was added sequentially with stirring 0.142 g of concentrated sulfuric acid, 2.45 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide with vigorous stirring for 30 minutes , and 0.781 g concentrated sulfuric acid. The resulting mixture was allowed to age overnight at 100&deg; C. under static conditions. The resulting 10% Al-MCM-41 mesostructure prepared from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors was filtered, and dried in air at ambient temperature.

Included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference> are the corresponding patterns for 14% Al-MCM-41 prepared as described in Example 14 using the very recently reported post-synthesis grafting reaction between a sodium-free MCM-41 silica and Al<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>oligocations (R.

This latter grafted form of Al-MCM-41 has been described as being &ldquo;ultrastable&rdquo; in comparison to all previously reported Al-MCM-41 derivatives. The XRD patterns of calcined 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>and ultrastable 14% Al-MCM-41 prior to steaming show well expressed hkl diffraction lines indicative of a hexagonal mesostructure. The diffraction lines for 10% Al MCM-41, made by the direct synthesis route of Example 16, are substantially broadened. This broadening of the diffraction lines is indicative of the disorder that normally accompanies the direct assembly of Al-MCM-41 from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors, particularly when the intended level of silicon substitution by aluminum in the framework is greater than about 8 mole %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The XRD patterns in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> clearly indicate that the 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>mesostructure assembled from nanoclustered zeolite seeds retains a well ordered hexagonal structure upon steaming at 800&deg; C. In comparison, the Al-MCM-41 mesostructures prepared both by direct assembly from conventional silicate and aluminate precursors and by so called ultrastable grafting reaction are almost totally destroyed by steaming. These observations are supported by a comparison of the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sorption isotherms shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference> for the same series of mesostructures.

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>sample of Example 15 retains more than 90% of its surface area and about 75% of its framework pore volume after steaming. In addition, the steam treatment improves the textural porosity of the mesostructure as evidenced by the hysteresis behavior at partial pressures above 0.50. In contrast, little or no surface area or framework pore volume is retained after steaming for either of the two Al-MCM-41 samples prepared according to Examples 14 and 16. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The unique hydrothermal stability of Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>is attributed at least in part to the retention of a zeolite-like connectivity of AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra upon assembling the zeolite seeds into a mesostructure. Also, the occluded carbon plays a role in contributing to the structural stability, because samples that are calcined for longer times at 541&deg; C. or at higher temperatures to remove more carbon exhibited a somewhat larger loss in surface area and pore volume upon steaming. However, in support of the importance of a zeolite-like connectivity of SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units in the framework walls, the Al chemical shift of tetrahedral aluminum in as-made and calcined Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>occurs at &dgr;&equals;60 ppm, the same value as the seeds solution and within the 59-65 ppm range observed for most zeolites (Lippma, E., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108 1730 (1986)). This chemical shift value is unique among aluminosilicate mesostructures. All previously reported mesostructured aluminosilicates, including the Al-MCM-41 samples of the present work, exhibit a chemical shift of 53-56 ppm. On the basis of the relationship between <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al chemical shift and the mean bond angle in framework aluminosilicates provided by Lippma et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 108, 1730 (1986)), the mean Al&mdash;O&mdash;Si angle is substantially smaller (by &minus;8 degrees) for the 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>of Example 15 than for the two Al-MCM-41 prepared as described in Examples 14 and 16. </paragraph>

A 75 ml portion of water was added to the stirred solution, and the solution was allowed to age at 85&deg; C. overnight under static conditions to form a clear solution of ZSM-5 zeolite seeds. A 2.45-g portion of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide then was added under vigorous stirring for 30 minutes, and the resulting mixture was allowed to age at 100&deg; C. under static conditions overnight. The pH of the reaction mixture was lowered to a value of 9.0 by the addition of 1.0 M sulfuric acid and the reaction mixture was aged again overnight at 100&deg; C. under static conditions. The mesostructured precipitate was filtered, washed, dried in air and then calcined at 550&deg; C. to remove the surfactant. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the calcined 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>product exhibited four diffraction lines (100, 110, 200, 210) consistent with a hexagonal mesostructure. The <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR spectrum of the calcined product exhibited a single resonance line at 55 ppm, consistent with the same linked AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedral environment as in ZSM-5 seeds (see the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR spectrum for ZSM-5 seeds in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Further evidence for a zeolite-like framework wall structure was obtained from the infrared absorption spectrum of the calcined 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>mesostructure. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, absorption bands between 500 and 600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, consistent with the presence of secondary 5-membered ring units, are observed. Included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> for comparison purposes are the infrared spectra for an authentic sample of 2% Al-ZSM-5 zeolite and for a hexagonal 5% Al-MCM-41 assembled from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors. The same bands between 500-600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>were found for the ZSM-5 zeolite, but the 5% Al-MCM-41 made from conventional precursors does not show these zeolite-like absorption bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Kloetstra et al (Chem. Commun., 2281 (1997)) have reported a hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructure which on the basis of IR bands between 500 and 600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>also contains 5-membered ring structures analogous to the secondary building blocks of ZSM-5 zeolite. This material was prepared by exchanging a conventional Al-MCM-41 with tetrapropylammonium ions and subsequently heating the exchanged mesostructure in glycerol to convert some of the framework into embryonal ZSM-5 units. However, we find upon repeating this work that the mesostructure of Kloetstra et al is hydrothermally unstable. Boiling the material in water for 5 hours or exposing it to 20% steam in nitrogen stream at 600&deg; C. for 5 hours results in nearly the complete loss of framework mesoporosity. In contrast, the hexagonal 2% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>of Example 18 retains nearly all of its framework mesoporosity under these conditions, Thus, the introduction of ZSM-5 type building blocks into the framework walls of MCM-41 by the method of Kloetstra appears to be localized to specific regions of the framework adjacent to tetrapropylammonium cations, whereas the use of zeolite seeds as precursors according to example 18 affords a more uniform framework of zeolite-like connectivity and, hence, greatly improved hydrothermal stability. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates that preparation of zeolite seeds for the assembly of hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructures is not limited to the use of sodium silicate precursor solutions containing 27 wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 14 wt % NaOH. Sodium silicate solutions containing higher ratios of silica to sodium hydroxide are also suitable for forming the zeolite seeds needed for the supramolecular assembly of hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Example 19 illustrates the use of a sodium silicate solution containing 28.43 wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 8.93 wt % NaOH for preparing zeolite type Y zeolite nucleating centers (seeds) and the subsequent use of these zeolite seeds for preparing an aluminosilicate mesostructure with a zeolite-like <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift in the range 57 to 65 ppm. The method used to prepare the seeds follows the general procedure provided by Vaughan, (U.S. Pat. No. 4,178,352) for a zeolite Y seeds composition containing 35 mole % aluminum (Si/Al&equals;1.88). A NaOH aqueous solution containing 1.013 mole NaOH and 7.6 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was prepared and 0.54 mole NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was added to this NaOH solution under stirring until a clear solution formed. To this basic sodium aluminate solution was added 1.0 mole of sodium silicate (28.43% SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 8.93 wt % NaOH, 41 degree, Be&prime;,) in 6.6 mol H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O under vigorous stirring. The product set to a stiff gel within 2 minutes after mixing was completed. The above gel was called type Y zeolite seeds or nucleation centers. In order to form a mesoporous aluminosilicate the above zeolite Y seeds, 127 mol H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was added to the diluted mixture. To the diluted mixture was added sequentially 0.5065 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and 0.20 mole CTAB under stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes. The resultant mixture was further acidified with 0.15 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and aged at 100&deg; C. for 20 h. The mixture then was acidified with 0.029 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>under vigorous stirring and aged at 100&deg; C. again for 20 h to obtain the as-made aluminosilicate mesostructure. The as-made mesostructure were washed thoroughly with water and dried in air. The product was calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove the surfactant. The calcined product exhibited a single XRD line consistent with a wormhole framework structure and denoted 35% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>. The corresponding basal spacing was about 5.0 nm. The chemical shift for the calcined product was 59 ppm, within the 57-65 ppm range expected for a hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructure assembled from zeolite seeds. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Mesoporous hexagonal, cubic or wormhole aluminosilicates derived from zeolite seeds using an ionic structure directing agent are described. The aluminum in the structures is stable so that the framework of the structures does not collapse when heated in the presence of water or water vapor (steam). The steam stable aluminosilicates can be used as acid catalysts for hydrocarbon conversions, including the fluidized bed catalytic cracking and the hydrocracking of petroleum oils, and other cracking of organic compounds. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to mesoporous aluminosilicate compositions which have a unique structure which are stable at high temperatures and under hydrothermal conditions. In particular, the present invention relates to a process for producing the mesoporous aluminosilicate composition which uses a zeolite seed with a structure directing agent. Further still, the present invention relates to novel cracking catalysts for oil and other organic molecules. The, present invention thus provides for the assembly of ultrastable mesoporous aluminosilicates with hexagonal, cubic and wormhole framework structures that do not suffer from the undesirable extensive de-alumination and steam instability of conventional aluminosilicate mesostructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> All previously reported aluminosilicate mesostructures, as prepared by either direct or post synthesis alumination, results in the extensive de-alumination of the framework upon calcination (Ryoo, R., et al., Chem. Commun. 2225 (1997); and Luan, Z. H., et al., J. Phys. Chem. 99 10590 (1995)). This undesired property has been attributed to the hydrolysis of the framework Al by steam generated in the calcination process (Corma, A., et al., J. Catal. 148 569 (1994); and Luan, Z. H., et al., J. Phys. Chem. 99 10590 (1995)). Regardless of the mechanism responsible for the de-alumination process, the acid catalytic properties of these materials for organic chemical conversions is greatly compromised. Moreover, all previously reported aluminosilicate mesostructures completely lose their framework mesoporosity when exposed to steam at the temperatures normally encountered in the processing of petroleum catalysts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Soon after the discovery of mesoporous MCM-41 molecular sieves (Beck, J. S., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114 10834 (1992)), it was found that the incorporation of aluminum into the framework introduced mild acidic-functionality, but the long range order and tetrahedral siting of the aluminum was compromised (Chen, C- Y., et al., Microporous Mater. 2 17 (1993); Borade, R. B., et al., Catal. Lett 31 267 (1994); Luan, Z. H., et al., J. Phys. Chem. 99 10590 (1995)), especially at intended aluminum loadings above about 8 mol %. Mild acidity and loss of structural integrity, together with poor steam stability under regeneration conditions made hexagonal Al-MCM-41 compositions unattractive candidates for the processing of high molecular weight petroleum fractions. More recently, important advances have been made in improving the structural integrity of Al-MCM-41 through direct assembly (Janicke, M. T., et al., Chem. Mater. 11 1342 (1999)) and post synthesis modification methods (Hamdan, H., et al., J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans 92 2311 (1996); Mokaya, R., et al., Chem. Commun. 2185 (1997); Ryoo, R., et al., J. Chem. Commun. 2225 (1997); and Ryoo, R., et al., Chem. Mater. 9 1607 (1998)). However, the low acidity and poor steam stability still limit potential applications in petroleum refining (Corma, A., Chem. Rev. 2373 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There is thus a need for improved aluminosilicate compositions that are stable, particularly in the presence of steam. In particular, the present invention relates to aluminosilicates that have stable framework structures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> This invention provides the structurally distinct families of mesoporous aluminosilicates that are stable solid acid catalysts under the harsh steaming conditions encountered in the regeneration of the catalyst in processes such as the refining of petroleum. This result has been achieved without added reagent or processing costs in comparison to the costs for producing conventional mesostructures. The large framework pore sizes (2.0-10.0 nm) make these new materials especially desirable as cracking catalysts or hydrocracking catalysts for the refining of &ldquo;heavy crudes&rdquo; containing very high molecular weight fractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The approach for making ultrastable aluminosilicate mesostructures is to prepare first a reaction mixture of nanometer-sized anionic aluminosilicate clusters that contain primarily four-coordinated aluminum and silicon as linked tetrahedral AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units. These nanoclustered aluminosilicate anions are then further linked into a mesoporous framework structure through supramolecular assembly reaction in the presence of a structure-directing surfactant, most preferably a quaternary ammonium ion surfactant. The surfactant can contain ammonium, phosphonium or arsonium ions in an organic molecule. The displacement of alkali metal ions, organic ions and surfactant from the as-made mesostructure provides a mesoporous structure with unique thermal and hydrothermal stability in comparison to previously disclosed aluminosilicate mesostructures. Most preferred are the mesoporous structures obtained by displacing the sodium ions, organic ions and most of the surfactant by treatment with a solution of ammonium ions (NH<highlight><subscript>4&plus;</subscript></highlight>). The calcination of these NH<highlight><subscript>4&plus;</subscript></highlight>-exchanged forms of the compositions at temperatures above about 500&deg; C. removes residual surfactant and converts the ammonium ions to protons, thus affording a stable solid acid for catalyzing a variety of organic chemical conversions, especially alkylation reactions,. isomerization reactions, cracking reactions, hydrocracking reactions, and hydrotreating reactions. The resulting acidic compositions can be easily incorporated as an active component of a conventional catalyst particle to improve catalytic conversions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In particular, an enhancement in the catalytic performance properties of FCC (fluidized bed catalytic cracking) particles can be expected by incorporating into the particle matrix the steam-stable mesoporous compositions of the present invention as a component capable of cracking a high fraction of the petroleum that comprises the resid or heavy end fraction of the petroleum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The nanoclustered aluminosilicate anions used to form the stable mesostructures of this invention are known in the art of zeolite chemistry as nucleating agents or, more generally, as &ldquo;zeolite seeds&rdquo;. They are given this term because they can be crystallized into a specific atomically ordered zeolite upon aging them as a solution, gel, or wet solid at elevated temperatures. In addition, some zeolite seeds can promote the nucleation and crystallization of a specific zeolite when they are added in small amounts to reaction mixtures of silicate and aluminate ions that would not normally form the desired zeolite of interest under equivalent conditions in the absence of the added seeds. In general, zeolite seeds can have two physical forms, namely, they can be in the form of sub-micrometer crystalline particles of the same zeolite that they nucleate, or they can be amorphous nanoclusters in solution, gel or solvent-suspended form. The sub-micrometer forms are often referred to as &ldquo;crystalline seeds&rdquo; whereas the amorphous nanoclustered forms are often called &ldquo;nucleating centers, gels, solutions, agents ,etc.&rdquo; For instance, Lechert et al. Stud. Surf. Sci. Catal., 84,147(1994) distinguishes between crystalline and amorphous gel forms of nucleating agents for type Y zeolites seeds. For the purposed of presenting the art of the present invention, however, we refer to both forms of these zeolite nucleating reagents as &ldquo;zeolite seeds&rsquo; or simply &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; whether they are sub-micrometer crystals or amorphous nanoclusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Zeolite seeds are formed by aging mixtures of silicate anions and aluminate anions under conditions of basic pH and, normally, elevated temperatures in the presence of specific inorganic and organic cations. The cations are selected so that they act as &ldquo;templates&rdquo; or, more precisely, as structure directors in forming the seeds. For example, the use of inorganic cations to form seeds of zeolite Y, more precisely the seeds of faujasitic zeolites, has been disclosed by Robson ACS Sym. Ser.,398,436 (1989), by Vaughan et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,178,352 (1979), Lechert et al, Stud. Sur. Sci. Catal., 84, 147 (1994), and by U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,574,538 and 3,808,326 to McDaniel et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,191 to Maher et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,789,107 to Elliott. The use of organic cations to form seeds of many different families of zeolites have been described by Lok et al. Zeolites, 3, 282 (1983); J. N. Watson et al. J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. (94) 2181 (1998); P. P. E. A. de Moor, et al. Chem. Mater. (11) 36 (1999); P. P. E. A. de Moor, et al. J. Phys. Chem. B (103) 1639 (1999) and S. I. Zones et al., Microporous Mesoporous. Mater. 21, 199(1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The structures of amorphous nanoclustered seeds is unknown, but it is presumed that the nanoclusters contain linkages of SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra that resemble the secondary building blocks found in crystalline zeolites. These secondary building blocks may contain rings of a specific number of space filling oxygen atoms that bridge the tetrahedrally coordinated silicon and aluminum centers, such as single and double 4-rings, 5-rings, 6-rings, and the like. Whatever the structure or connectivity of the SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units in nanoclustered aluminosilicate seeds may be, they are powerful structure-directing reagents in the nucleation of zeolite phases. The nanoclusters may be regarded as being &ldquo;proto-zeolitic&rdquo; by bearing a structure or tetrahedral building block connectivity that readily promotes zeolite crystallization. The art of the present invention discloses that these same protozeolitic seeds are preferred precursors for the supramolecular assembly of highly stable mesostructured aluminosilicate molecular sieves, even though the framework walls remain largely disordered in comparison to the atomically well-ordered framework walls of conventional zeolites. However, we do not exclude from the disclosed art the use of crystalline sub-micron zeolite seeds as precursors to the assembly of stable mesostructured aluminosilicate molecular sieves. Such small crystalline zeolite seeds can be transformed, at least in part, into stable framework wall-forming substructures under the conditions used to assemble a mesostructure. In addition, crystalline zeolite seeds may be admixed with amorphous nanoclustered seeds. Indeed, the residual crystalline zeolite seeds could even become embedded in the walls of the stabilized aluminosilicate mesostructures formed from the amorphous cluster fraction of the seed precursors. Mesostructures with such biphasic walls could have useful properties as catalysts for size dependent sequential chemical conversions, such as the cracking reactions involved in the refining of petroleum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The structural order, acidity and steam stability of hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructures all can be substantially improved through the assembly of nanoclustered precursors that normally nucleate the crystallization of microporous zeolites, particularly zeolites type Y and ZSM-5. These zeolite seeds are presumed to promote zeolite nucleation by adopting AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra connectivities that resemble the secondary structural elements in a crystalline zeolite. Assembling these same zeolite seeds into a mesostructure imparts acidity and hydrothermal stability that begin to approach zeolites, even though the framework walls&apos; remain in large part atomically disordered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The assembly of hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructures from zeolite seeds according to the teachings of this invention is not limited to zeolite Y formed from inorganic cations or to ZSM-5 seeds formed from organic cations. Any zeolite seed composition can be used to form aluminosilicate mesostructures with a hydrothermal stability that is substantially improved in comparison to the same mesostructures prepared from conventional precursors. The literature discloses numerous examples of organic molecules and ions that organize (or &ldquo;template&rdquo;) silicate and aluminate anions into nanoclustered units that seed the nucleation of crystalline zeolites (see, for example, B. M. Lok, et al. Zeolites (3) 282 (1983); R. E. Boyett, et al., Zeolites (17) 508 (1996); S. I. Zones, et al. Microporous Mesoporous Mater. (21) 199 (1998)). All of these zeolite seed compositions formed from organic templating agents are preferred precursors for the surfactant-directed supramolecular assembly of aluminosilicate mesostructures with enhanced hydrothermal stabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The assembly of zeolite seeds, particularly amorphous nanoclustered seeds, into a mesoporous framework causes the framework aluminum to remain in large part tetrahedral as AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units even after calcination. Also, the siting of the aluminum is more like that found in a hydrothermally stable zeolite, as indicated by the aluminum nmr chemical shift. By doing so, up to 35 mol % aluminum can be easily incorporated into hexagonal and wormhole silicate frameworks, denoted MSU-SH and MSU-SW, respectively. Up to 13% Al was incorporated into cubic silicate mesostructures, denoted MSU-Sc. More importantly, at least half and more typically more than 75% or even 90% of the aluminum sites remain tetrahedral after calcination at 540&deg; C. Also the Al-NMR chemical shift, as well as the shape and width of the resonance, was very similar to that of microporous zeolite Y. These latter results indicate that the local structure of the aluminum is analogous to that found in one of the most stable and most widely used zeolites in the petrochemical industry. Thus, these new ultrastable mesostructures with pore sizes in the range 2.0 to 15 nm are very useful for many applications where zeolite Y and other zeolites cannot be used because of a limited pore size below 1.0 nm. In addition, the structures remain stable even after treatment in 20% steam at 800&deg; C. for up to 5 hours, making them suitable for cracking or hydrocracking of high molecular weight petroleum fractions that cannot be processed by zeolite Y. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructures with Si/Al ratios in the range 80-2.0 have been assembled from aluminosilicate nanoclusters that normally nucleate the crystallization of zeolites type Y and ZSM-5. The aluminum content can be made very low in the case of ZSM-5 seeds increasing the Si/Al ratio to a value of 1000 and beyond. The calcined hexagonal mesostructures of this invention, denoted Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, are well-ordered, and structurally stable when exposed to 20% steam at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours. Al MAS NMR chemical shifts indicate that, unlike mesostructures assembled from conventional precursors, the mean Al&mdash;O&mdash;Si angle is similar to the value found for many crystalline zeolites. The steam stability of 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, together with an intrinsic acidity sufficient to crack cumene over the temperature range 300-450&deg; C., suggests that nanoclustered zeolite seeds are promising precursors for the design of hydrothermally stable mesostructures for the acid-catalyzed processing of high molecular weight petroleum fractions that cannot be adequately refined over microporous zeolites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Three structurally relevant properties embody the stable mesostructured aluminosilicate compositions of this invention from previously disclosed mesostructures. In the first general structural embodiment of the invention, the preferred compositions prepared from zeolite seeds have an experimentally observed <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift in the range 57-65 ppm relative to an aqueous 1.0 M aluminum nitrate as an external chemical shift reference. This is the chemical shift range that is found for many crystalline zeolite, including zeolite Y and other faujasitic zeolites. All previously reported mesostructured aluminosilicates prepared from conventional silicate and aluminate precursors, including the original Al-MCM-41 compositions of Beck et al., exhibit a chemical shift of-53-56 ppm. Chemical shift values in the range of 57-65 ppm are indicative of a zeolite-like connectivity of the SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and the AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units that comprise the framework walls of the mesostructures, even though the framework walls are largely disordered. We postulate that the zeolitic connectivity of the said tetrahedral units contributes substantially to the improvement in the hydrothermal stability of these preferred mesostructured compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the second structural embodiment, the 27 1 MAS NMR chemical shifts of the preferred compositions fall in the range of previously disclosed mesostructured aluminosilicate compositions, namely, 53-56 ppm, but are distinguish by the presence of an infrared adsorption band in the frequency range 500-600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and by the retention of at least 80% of the initial framework mesopore volume is retained when the composition is exposed to boiling water for 5 hours or to 20% steam at 600&deg; C. for 5hours. The infrared band at 500-600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>is indicative of the presence of zeolite like secondary building blocks (e.g., 5-membered or 6-membered ring structures ) in the amorphous framework walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the third structural embodiment, the preferred aluminosilicate compositions of this invention are free of sodium exchange cations, exhibit a zeolite-like <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift in the range 57 to 65 ppm, and contain between 0.01 and 10 wt % carbon embedded in the framework mesopores. The sodium ions in the as-made mesostructures are displaced by ion exchange reaction with an ammonium salt, most preferably ammonium nitrate, in aqueous solution in the presence of the structure directing surfactant in the framework mesopores This exchange reaction also displaces a substantial amount of surfactant from the mesopores. Subsequent to the ion exchange reaction with ammonium ions, the mesostructure is calcined in air at a temperature sufficient to remove the remaining surfactant and to convert the ammonium exchange ions to protons, most preferably at a temperature of 540&deg; C. for a period of about 5 hours. This calcination procedure converts some of the remaining framework surfactant to carbon, presumably through cracking reactions of the surfactant in the acidic mesopores of the framework. The embedded carbon, which can amount to 0.01 to 10 wt % of the calcined mesostructure depending on calcination conditions, plays an important role in the hydrothermal stability of the mesostructures, presumably by reinforcing the framework against collapse under hydrothermal conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In view of the importance of the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shift measurements in characterizing the preferred compositions of this invention, we briefly describe the measurement of this diagnostic parameter. In magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiment, the energy levels of the magnetic nucleus are split by the imposed magnetic field. Transitions between these energy levels are made to occur through the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the radio frequency range, typically the megahertz range. The absorption of the electromagnetic radiation gives rise to a &ldquo;resonance&rdquo; line at a frequency that is energetically equivalent to the energy separation between the magnetic energy levels for the nucleus under investigation. The sample is spun at an angle to the imposed magnetic field (the so-called magnetic angle) to average&mdash;out dipolar interactions that can broaden the resonance lines and complicate the spectrum. Because the electrons surrounding the nucleus contribute to the magnetic field experienced by the nucleus, the resonance frequency is dependent on the chemical environment. Thus, the resonance frequency &ldquo;shifts&rdquo;, depending on the chemical environment. These &ldquo;chemical shifts&rdquo; in the resonance frequency are recorded in &ldquo;parts per million&rdquo; (ppm) frequency units relative to the frequency of a reference compound with a known chemical environment and an arbitrarily assigned chemical shift of 0 ppm. The magnitude of the chemical shift is often used to deduce information on the chemical environment of the nucleus in the chemical compound being studied by MAS NMR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the case of quadrupolar <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al nuclei, the splitting of the nuclear energy levels is determined by the nuclear magnetic spin quantum number 1&equals;5/2. The observed MAS NMR spectrum is typically dominated by the (&plus;&frac12;, &minus;&frac12;) central transition. The experimentally observed chemical shift for the resonance line corresponding to this transition can be influenced by quadrupolar interactions of the nucleus with the electric field gradient at the nucleus. Generally speaking, the observed <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shifts are too small and should be corrected for quadrupolar interactions to obtain the true values of the chemical shifts. However, if the electric field gradient at the nucleus is small, then the error in the observed resonance position for the (&plus;&frac12;, &minus;&frac12;) transition also is small (about 1 ppm or so in error) and no correction in the observed chemical shift is needed, especially if the differences in the chemical shifts being compared are much larger than the error caused by quadrupolar effects. This is typically the case for the AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra in most zeolites and related aluminosilicates (see Lippmaa et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 108 1730 (1986)), as well as for the Al(H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight> cations that are used as the chemical shift reference in <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al NMR spectroscopy. For this reason, the chemical shifts reported here and in the literature for aluminosilicate mesostructures are not corrected for quadrupolar effects. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In order to have a contrast example for our newly invented aluminosilicate mesoporous molecular sieves, we prepared a conventional (well-ordered ) hexagonal MCM-41 aluminosilicate molecular sieve in which the overall Si/Al molar ratio was 49/1. This Example 1 sample is denoted 2% Al-MCM-41. The synthesis recipe was as follows: a solution containing the appropriate amounts of sodium aluminate (NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and sodium silicate solution was mixed, and then the required amount of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>acid was added under stirring to obtain a clear solution. Next, the required amount of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide in water was added and the mixture was stirred vigorous at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The resultant mixture was aged without stirring in a teflon lined autoclave at 100&deg; C. for 2 days. The product was recovered by filtration and thoroughly washing with deionized water.

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The sample after calcination at 650 degrees centigrade exhibited a BET surface area of 1037 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g, a total pore volume of 0.77 cc/g and an effective pore size of 33 A as determined from the Horvath-Kawazoe model. The X-ray diffraction pattern exhibited three diffraction lines with d-spacings at 43.2, 24.9, and 21.6 &angst; and corresponding to the (100), (110) and (200) reflections, respectively, of a hexagonal mesostructure. The <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>AL-NMR spectrum for this particular sample is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In agreement with the findings reported by Corma and his coworkers, the MCM-41 aluminosilicate mesostructure prepared by this procedure has about &frac13; of the Al-sites in octahedral coordination and the remainder in tetrahedral coordination after calcination. The tetrahedral Al-sites exhibited a chemical shift at 53 ppm relative to 1.0 M aluminum nitrate solution, whereas the chemical shift for the aluminum in octahedral sites was 0 to 10 ppm. These chemical shifts are in agreement with the typical literature values (i.e. 53&tilde;56 ppm for tetrahedral aluminum and &tilde;0.0 ppm for octahedral aluminum for a conventional Al-MCM-41. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> These two examples illustrate according to the teachings of the present invention the preparation of mesoporous aluminosilicates with hexagonal, cubic, and wormhole framework structures that are steam-stable in comparison to like mesostructure compositions obtained from conventional aluminosilicate precursors. The preferred aluminosilicate precursors of this invention contain nanosized aggregates in which the aluminum is in tetrahedral coordination and linked through bridging oxygen atoms to silicon tetrahedra that in are largely in Q<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>connectivity to other silicon tetrahedra. By Q<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>connectivity we mean that the SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedron is linked through bridging oxygens to four adjacent tetrahedra that are occupied by silicon and aluminum. These nanosized aluminosilicate precursors also are capable of promoting the crystallization of atomically ordered zeolite phases when mixed with suitable gels and aged under hydrothermal conditions. Owing to their ability to nucleate zeolitic phases, such as zeolites type Y (more precisely faujasitic zeolites) and ZSM-5 (more precisely MFI zeolites, these highly cross-linked precursors are often referred to as &ldquo;zeolite seeds&rdquo;. Therefore, the aluminosilicate precursor of Example 2 is referred to here as a &ldquo;type Y seeds&rdquo;. composition, because it is known to promote the crystallization of Type Y zeolite. Likewise, the cross-linked aluminosilicate precursor of Example 3 is referred to here as &ldquo;IZSM-5 seeds&rdquo;, because the precursor is known to nucleate the crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolite. However, in this example we use these zeolite seeds as precursors to mesoporous molecular sieve aluminosilicates with atomically disordered (amorphous) walls, but with a hexagonal, cubic or wormhole pore structure that sufficiently order on a mesoscopic length scale to exhibit correlation (Bragg) peaks in the powder X-ray diffraction pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The type Y seeds composition of Example 2, which contained 10 mole % aluminum (Si/Al&equals;9/1), was prepared in the following manner. A NaOH aqueous solution with 0.088 mole NaOH and 8.5 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>0 was prepared and 0.10 mole NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was added to this NaOH solution under stirring until a clear solution formed. To this basic sodium aluminate solution was added 1.0 mole of sodium silicate from a 27 wt % sodium silicate solution under vigorous stirring until a homogeneous opalescence gel formed. To obtain the Y-seeds composition, the gel was sequentially aged at ambient temperature over night and then at 10&deg; C. over night. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The 5% Al-ZSM-5-seeds composition corresponding to Example 3 was prepared from tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as the silicon source and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as the template for ZSM-5 seed formation. TEOS (1.0 mole) was mixed with 0.22 mole of 1.0 M TPAOH to obtain a clear solution under mild heating. Then 0.05 mole aluminum sec-butoxide was added to obtain an opaque solution. The solution was diluted with 127 mole water and aged at 85&deg; C. for 3 days to produce a clear ZSM-5 seeds solution. 27Al -MAS NMR spectra of the above Type Y and ZSM-5 seeds compositions were recorded on a Varian VRX 400S instrument in a zirconia rotor at spinning speeds of 2 kHz and 900 Hz, respectively. The spectra are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> provides the X-ray diffraction pattern of the 10% Al-Y-seeds obtained by smearing the Y-seeds gel on a glass plate in the absence (bottom) or the presence of ethanol (top) to help promote the aggregation of the aluminosilicate precursor. The single <highlight><superscript>27 </superscript></highlight>Al NMR lines with chemical shifts of 55 and 59 ppm correspond to aluminum in a zeolite-like tetrahedral environment. In other words, the aluminosilicate species in the precursor compositions exhibit an NMR pattern consistent with the presence of nano-sized aluminosilicate clusters, as reported in the literature (White et al, <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. </italic></highlight>1998, 94, 2181; van Santen et al, <highlight><italic>Chem. Mater. </italic></highlight>1999, 11, 36). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The following examples will illustrate the use of these nano-clustered zeolite seeds as precursors for the assembly of aluminosilicate mesostructures with hexagonal, cubic, and wormhole frameworks that are ultrastable under steaming conditions in comparison to mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves prepared from conventional precursor solutions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> These three examples were designed to illustrate the use of nanoclustered zeolite seeds according to art of the present invention for the preparation of mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves with long range hexagonal order even at high tetrahedral aluminum concentrations in the framework. The hexagonal order is retained even after the mesostructures have been calcined to remove the surfactant. These mesostructures also exhibited a <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>AL-NMR resonance with a chemical shift substantially greater than 56 ppm, indicating a more zeolitic connectivity of SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units in the framework walls. This minimum chemical shift value for our new aluminate mesostructures is larger than the previously reported literature values for all known aluminated derivatives of silica mesostructures, regardless of the long range structural order of the mesostructure or the method used to form the aluminated derivatives. Moreover, the aluminum NMR chemical shifts for our new aluminosilicate mesostructures are comparable to the values typically observed for the siting of aluminum centers of crystalline zeolites, including steam stable HY zeolite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates how the art of the present invention overcomes the destructive effect of direct aluminum incorporation that is normally encountered in the assembly of a mesoporous aluminosilicate with long range hexagonal order.

In this example, tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) in place of CTAB as the structure director. A reaction mixture containing 0.25 mole TTAB as the surfactant structure director and a 20 mol % Al type Y zeolite aluminosilicate precursor was prepared and processed in the same way as described in Examples 4 to 6.

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> These two examples were designed to demonstrate the art of the present invention for the preparation of our new aluminosilicate mesostructures with long range cubic order, which we denote as Al-MSU-Sc. These cubic compositions also exhibit tetrahedral <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-NMR resonances at chemical shifts greater than 56 ppm and similar to the chemical shift of HY zeolite. Two cubic mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves with Al contents of 2 mol %, and 10 mol % were prepared corresponding to examples 8 and 9, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> To obtain the said cubic mesostructures, gel-like zeolite type Y aluminosilicate seed precursors with the appropriate Al content were obtained according to Example 2 and diluted with 127 mole water. For each mole of silicon used in the reaction mixture, the diluted gel was first treated with 0.044 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>to lower the pH. Then 0.12 mole CTAB and 3.0 mole ethanol was sequentially added under vigorous stirring at ambient 20 temperature. After being stirred for 40 minutes the pH of the reaction mixture was reduced with the addition of 0.14 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The resulting mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 150&deg; C. for 15 h. The as-made products were recovered by filtration, air-dried and then calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove the surfactant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the top diffraction pattern is for the calcined 10%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>sample prepared from type Y zeolite seeds as described in Example 9. The bottom diffraction pattern is for 2%Al-MCM-48 as a contrast sample (Example 10). This contrast sample was prepared from conventional precursors by mixing diluted sodium silicate (1.0 mole) and sodium aluminate (0.02 mole) and NaOH (0.088 mole) solutions to obtain a clear solution and then reducing the pH immediately with 0.18 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. Then, 0.12 mole CTAB and 3 mole ethanol per mole of silicon was sequentially added under vigorously stirring at ambient temperature before transferring the reaction mixture to a Teflon-lined autoclave to age at 150&deg; C. for 15 h. The product was then washed and calcined at 540&deg; C. to remove the surfactant. This same procedure afforded a well-ordered cubic MCM-48-like silica when the aluminum was omitted from the reaction mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> It is clear from the XRD pattern for the calcined 10%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>mesostructure in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> that a well ordered cubic mesoporous aluminosilicate molecular sieves was obtained from type Y zeolite seeds as the inorganic precursor. In contrast, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also shows that the calcined 2%Al-MCM-48 mesostructure prepared from conventional sodium aluminate, sodium silicate precursors and surfactant is disordered as judged from the broad low angle x-ray reflections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al-NMR spectra of 2%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>from Example 8 and 2%Al-MCM-48 from Example 10 are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The zeolite-like resonance at a chemical shift of 62 ppm clearly indicates the exclusive presence of tetrahedral Al-sites for the cubic 2%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>. An analogous result was obtained for the cubic 10%-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>mesostructure prepared in Example 9. However, the resonance for the tetrahedra aluminum in 2%Al-MCM-48 occurs at a chemical shift of 56 ppm. In addition, this latter mesostructure exhibits a resonance (indicated by the arrow) at 0 ppm corresponding to octahedral Al-sites. Consequently, we can conclude that pre-formation of aluminosilicate nanocluster indeed improves the long range order of cubic mesostructures as well as the Al-sitting in these mesoporous molecular sieves. The BET surface area (and pore volume) measured from N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>adsorption isotherms for the MSU-S<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>samples prepared from Example 8 and 9 were 976 (0.70) and 599 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g (0.51 cc/g).

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> These two examples were designed to illustrate the versatility of using pre-formed aluminosilicate nanoclusters to assemble wormhole-like mesoporous molecular sieves, denoted MSU-S<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>, with zeolite-like tetrahedral Al-sites (as judged from <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al NMR chemical shifts), as well as textural porosity that is useful for catalysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Example 11 made use of preformed Zeolite Y (faujasitic) seeds as described in Example 2. Example 12 made use of preformed ZSM-5 seeds as described in Example 3. In Example 11 a 10%Al-containing seeds composition was prepared as described in Example 2 and then 0.073 mole CTAB was added per mole of Si under vigorously stirring at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The resultant mixture was aged at 100&deg; C. for 2 days and the product was filtered, washed and air-dried. For Example 12, a clear 5%Al-ZSM-5 seeds solution obtained as described in Example 3 and then 0.073 mole CTAB per mole silica was added at ambient temperature under stirring. The resultant mixture was aged at 100&deg; C. for 2 days and the product was recovered by filtration, washed and air-dried. The surfactant in the samples obtained from Examples 11 and 12 was removed from the framework pores by calcination at 540&deg; C. in air for 7 h. </paragraph>

The samples were dusted onto a copper-grid to obtain the images. Both wormhole-like framework pore channels and intraparticle textural mesopores are observed for both samples. The textural pores result from the intergrowth of nanoscale framework domains of primary particles. In agreement with the textural porosity evident in the TEM images, the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>adsorption-desorption isotherms, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> for the calcined materials, exhibit a large amount of textural porosity as evidenced by the hysteresis loop at partial pressures above 0.80. The filling of the framework wormhole pores is indicated by the step in the adsorption isotherms at partial pressures between 0.25 and 0.45. In agreement with a wormhole framework structure, the X-ray diffraction patterns (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) for the calcined aluminosilicate mesoporous molecular sieves of examples 11 and 12 contain a single intense X-ray diffraction line corresponding to the correlation length between the wormhole pores and a weak higher order refectin at higher scattering angle.

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 13 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The purpose for this example was to show that the aluminosilicate mesostructures prepared from nanoclustered zeolite seeds according to the present art are capable of surviving exposure to steam at 800&deg; C., at least when the structures are free of sodium ions and surfactant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Samples of 10%Al-MSU-S and 20%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>, were prepared from nanoclustered zeolite Y type seeds according to the general procedure described in Examples 4-6. One-gram quantities of each as-made sample were separately treated with 100 ml 0.1 M NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>aqueous solution at 100&deg; C. for overnight. The treated samples were recovered by filtration and calcined at 540&deg; C. in air for 7 hours to remove the surfactant in the mesopores. These calcined samples were used for steam stability testing. Each sample was steamed at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours in the a stream of 20 vol % steam-containing N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Then the X-ray diffraction patterns and nitrogen adsorption isotherms were used to investigate the retention of a mesoporous structure after steaming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is obvious that the aluminosilicate mesostructures formed from preformed aluminosilicate nanoclusters retained their hexagonal structural integrity entirely, but the conventional MCM-41 like hexagonal mesostructure collapsed after steaming treatment at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours. This is in agreement with what has been reported previously by Ryoo and his co-workers (Ryoo, J. Phys. Chem. 1995, 99, 16742) regarding the stability of MCM-41 prepared from conventional precursors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Chemical analysis of the calcined samples before steaming indicated the presence of about 0.8% carbon. Samples calcined for periods longer or shorter periods than eight hours contained quantities of carbon lower than or greater than the 0.8 wt % value, respectively. Also, the degree to which the samples retained a hexagonal X-ray pattern and a framework mesoporosity after steaming generally paralleled the carbon content. Thus, we conclude that the framework embedded carbon, as well as the zeolite-like connectivity of the framework walls contributes to the steam stability of these materials. </paragraph>

To obtain the primary MCM-41 silica, 2.0 g of fumed silica was added to a solution containing 3.0 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 0.610 g tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) in 24 g H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O at 35&deg; C. under stirring for 1 h. After further stirring for 1 h, the resulting synthetic gel of molar composition 1.SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; 0.25 CTAB: 0.2TMAOH; 40H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O was left to age 20 h at room temperature then the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 150&deg; C. for 48h. The solid product was obtained by filtration, washed with distilled water, dried in air at room temperature and calcined at 550&deg; C. for 8h. The &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; MCM-41 silica was then prepared from the primary MCM-41 silica. To prepare the secondary MCM-41, a synthesis gel of same molar ratio was prepared, except that the primary calcined MCM-41 was used as silica source instead of fumed silica. The synthetic procedures were identical to the described for the primary synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The procedure for the steam stability test was as follows: 0.2 g of ultra stable MCM-41 was put into a Y-shaped quartz tube reactor and a stream of 20 vol % steam in N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was introduced at 800&deg; C. for 5 hours. The 20% water steam in N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was generated using a saturator. The X-ray diffraction patterns and N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-sorption and desorption isotherms were used to evaluate the residual structure after steaming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As shown by the X-ray and N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>adsorption data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A, 11B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>C, the ultrastable MCM-41 of Mokaya underwent structural collapsed after the steaming treatment at 800&deg; C. for 5 and the surface area was reduced by 92% to 62 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g by steaming. Also, the 2 Al MAS NMR spectrum in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows that only about half the aluminum is in tetrahedral environments (&tilde;51 ppm) and the other half is in octahedral environments (&tilde;0 ppm). We conclude that this material lacks the desired stability for many practical applications in acid catalysis, especially catalytic cracking. </paragraph>

The procedure used here for forming the zeolite type Y seeds follows the general methodology described in the literature (Robson, H. ACS Symp. Ser. 398 436 (1989); and Lechert, L., et al., Stud. Surf. Sci. Catal. 84 147 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Example 16 describes the preparation of a 10%Al-MCM-41 from convention silicate and aluminate precursors by eliminating the zeolite seeds-forming step used in the preparation of the 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>in Example 15. We then compare on the basis of XRD and nitrogen adsorption properties the steam stabilities of these two mesostructures. In addition, we include in the comparison of steam stability the &ldquo;ultrastable&rdquo; Al-MCM-41 prepared as described in Example 14 using the method of Mokaya. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>of Example 15 was prepared as follows. First, 0.269 g NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was dissolved in a solution of 0.116 g of NaOH in 5.0 ml water to obtain a clear solution. To this solution was added 7.29 g of sodium silicate solution (27 wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 14 wt % NaOH) under vigorous stirring to obtain a homogeneous mixture. To generate faujasitic type Y zeolite seeds, the resulting mixture was aged at room temperature overnight and then an additional 24 hour period at 100&deg; C. under static conditions. The mixture of zeolite seeds was diluted with 75 ml of water to obtain a milky suspension. Concentrated sulfuric acid (0.142 g) was added to the seeds mixture, followed by the addition of 2.45 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) under vigorous stirring for 30 minutes. Then an additional 0.781 g of sulfuric acid was added and the mixture was allowed to age at 100&deg; C. under static conditions overnight. Following this aging step additional increments of 0.156 g and 0.781 g of sulfuric acid were added and the mixture was again allowed to age at 100&deg; C. overnight under static conditions to form the mesostructure. At this point the pH of the reaction mixture was about 9.0 The resulting 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>product prepared from zeolite seed precursors was filtered, washed, and dried at ambient temperature in air. A 1.0-g quantity of the air-dried product was treated with 100 ml of 1.0M NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>at 100&deg; C. overnight to displace sodium ions and about half of the surfactant from the mesopores, dried in air, and then calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove remaining surfactant and to convert charge-balancing ammonium ions to protons. Chemical analysis of the calcined product indicated a Si:Al molar ratio of 9:1, along with the presence of 0.80 wt % carbon. We attribute the formation of carbon to the cracking of surfactant in the very acidic mesopores of the zeolite-like framework of the hexagonal MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>mesostructure during calcination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The 10%Al-MCM-41 comparative sample of Example 16 was prepared as follows. A mixture of 0.269 g of NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 7.29 g of sodium silicate (27wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 14 wt % NaOH) were stirred vigorously to form a homogeneous mixture and then 75 ml of water was added to form a milky suspension. To the milky suspension was added sequentially with stirring 0.142 g of concentrated sulfuric acid, 2.45 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide with vigorous stirring for 30 minutes, and 0.781 g concentrated sulfuric acid. The resulting mixture was allowed to age overnight at 100&deg; C. under static conditions. The resulting 10%Al-MCM-41 mesostructure prepared from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors was filtered, and dried in air at ambient temperature.

Included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</cross-reference> are the corresponding patterns for 14%Al-MCM-41 prepared as described in Example 14 using the very recently reported post-synthesis grafting reaction between a sodium-free MCM-41 silica and Al<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>oligocations (R. Mokaya, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 38, 2930 (1999)). This latter grafted form of Al-MCM-41 has been described as being &ldquo;ultrastable&rdquo; in comparison to all previously reported Al-MCM-41 derivatives. The XRD patterns of calcined 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>and ultrastable 14%Al-MCM-41 prior to steaming show well expressed hkl diffraction lines indicative of a hexagonal mesostructure. The diffraction lines for 10%Al MCM-41, made by the direct synthesis route of Example 16, are substantially broadened. This broadening of the diffraction lines is indicative of the disorder that normally accompanies the direct assembly of Al-MCM-41 from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors, particularly when the intended level of silicon substitution by aluminum in the framework is greater than about 8 mole %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The XRD patterns in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12 B</cross-reference> clearly indicate that the 10%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>mesostructure assembled from nanoclustered zeolite seeds retains a well ordered hexagonal structure upon steaming at 800&deg; C. In comparison, the Al-MCM-41 mesostructures prepared both by direct assembly from conventional silicate and aluminate precursors and by so called ultrastable grafting reaction are almost totally destroyed by steaming. These observations are supported by a comparison of the N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sorption isotherms shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</cross-reference> for the same series of mesostructures.

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The 10% Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>sample of Example 15 retains more than 90% of its surface area and about 75% of its framework pore volume after steaming. In addition, the steam treatment improves the textural porosity of the mesostructure as evidenced by the hysteresis behavior at partial pressures above 0.50. In contrast, little or no surface area or framework pore volume is retained after steaming for either of the two Al-MCM-41 samples prepared according to Examples 14 and 16. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The unique hydrothermal stability of Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>is attributed at least in part to the retention of a zeolite-like connectivity of AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedra upon assembling the zeolite seeds into a mesostructure. Also, the occluded carbon plays a role in contributing to the structural stability, because samples that are calcined for longer times at 541&deg; C. or at higher temperatures to remove more carbon exhibited a somewhat larger loss in surface area and pore volume upon steaming. However, in support of the importance of a zeolite-like connectivity of SiO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>units in the framework walls, the Al chemical shift of tetrahedral aluminum in as-made and calcined Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>occurs at &dgr;&equals;60 ppm, the same value as the seeds solution and within the 59-65 ppm range observed for most zeolites (Lippma, E., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108 1730 (1986)). This chemical shift value is unique among aluminosilicate mesostructures. All previously reported mesostructured aluminosilicates, including the Al-MCM-41 samples of the present work, exhibit a chemical shift of 53-56 ppm. On the basis of the relationship between <highlight><superscript>27 </superscript></highlight>Al chemical shift and the mean bond angle in framework aluminosilicates provided by Lippma et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 108, 1730 (1986)), the mean Al&mdash;O&mdash;Si angle is substantially smaller (by -8 degrees) for the 10%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>of Example 15 than for the two Al-MCM-41 prepared as described in Examples 14 and 16. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Example 18 utilizes MFI type ZSM-5 zeolite seeds templated by tetrapropylammonium ions to form a hexagonal <highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>aluminosilicate molecular sieve with superior hydrothermal stability. In contrast to the Al-MSU-SH compositions reported in Examples 4, 5, and 6, where the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR chemical shifts are well within the zeolitic range of 57-65 ppm, the <highlight><superscript>27 </superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR shift observed for the product of this example was equivalent to the shift found for the initial ZSM-5 seed precursor and comparable to the shifts typically found for aluminosilicate mesostructures assemble from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors (53-56 ppm). However, the resulting mesostructure showed an infrared absorption band indicative of the presence of ZSM-5 type secondary building blocks in the framework walls. The presence of a stable, zeolite-like framework wall structure for the product of this example was verified by a hydrothermal stability to both steam and boiling water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Tetraethylorthosilicate (6.83 g) was added with stirring to 7.22 ml of 1.0 M tetrapropylammonium hydroxide and then 0.17 g of aluminum sec-butoxide was added to form a clear solution. A 75 ml portion of water was added to the stirred solution, and the solution was allowed to age at 85&deg; C. overnight under static conditions to form a clear solution of ZSM-5 zeolite seeds. A 2.45-g portion of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide then was added under vigorous stirring for 30 minutes, and the resulting mixture was allowed to age at 100&deg; C. under static conditions overnight. The pH of the reaction mixture was lowered to a value of 9.0 by the addition of 1.0 M sulfuric acid and the reaction mixture was aged again overnight at 100&deg; C. under static conditions. The mesostructured precipitate was filtered, washed, dried in air and then calcined at 550&deg; C. to remove the surfactant. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the calcined 2%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>product exhibited four diffraction lines (100, 110, 200, 210) consistent with a hexagonal mesostructure. The <highlight><superscript>27 </superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR spectrum of the calcined product exhibited a single resonance line at 55 ppm, consistent with the same linked AlO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedral environment as in ZSM-5 seeds (see the <highlight><superscript>27</superscript></highlight>Al MAS NMR spectrum for ZSM-5 seeds in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Further evidence for a zeolite -like framework wall structure was obtained from the infrared absorption spectrum of the calcined 2%Al-MSU-SH mesostructure. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, absorption bands between 500 and 600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, consistent with the presence of secondary 5 membered ring units, are observed. Included in FIG. 15 for comparison purposes are the infrared spectra for an authentic sample of 2%Al-ZSM-5 zeolite and for a hexagonal 5%Al-MCM-41 assembled from conventional aluminate and silicate precursors. The same bands between 500-600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>were found for the ZSM-5 zeolite, but the 5%Al-MCM-41 made from conventional precursors does not show these zeolite -like absorption bands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Kloetstra et al (Chem. Commun., 2281 (1997)) have reported a hexagonal aluminosilicate mesostructure which on the basis of IR bands between 500 and 600 cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>also contains 5-membered ring structures analogous to the secondary building blocks of ZSM-5 zeolite. This material was prepared by exchanging a conventional Al-MCM-41 with tetrapropylammonium ions and subsequently heating the exchanged mesostructure in glycerol to convert some of the framework into embryonal ZSM-5 units. However, we find upon repeating this work that the mesostructure of Kloetstra et al is hydrothermally unstable. Boiling the material in water for 5 hours or exposing it to 20% steam in nitrogen stream at 600&deg; C. for 5 hours results in nearly the complete loss of framework mesoporosity. In contrast, the hexagonal 2%Al-MSU-SH of Example 18 retains nearly all of its framework mesoporosity under these conditions, Thus, the introduction of ZSM-5 type building blocks into the framework walls of MCM-41 by the method of Kloetstra appears to be localized to specific regions of the framework adjacent to tetrapropylammonium cations, whereas the use of zeolite seeds as precursors according to example 18 affords a more uniform framework of zeolite -like connectivity and, hence, greatly improved hydrothermal stability. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates that preparation of zeolite seeds for the assembly of hydrothermally stable aluminosilicate mesostructures is not limited to the use of sodium silicate precursor solutions containing 27 wt % SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 14 wt % NaOH.

The method used to prepare the seeds follows the general procedure provided by Vaughan (U.S. Pat. No. 4,178,352) for a zeolite Y seeds composition containing 35 mole % aluminum (Si/Al&equals;1.88). A NaOH aqueous solution containing 1.013 mole NaOH and 7.6 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>0 was prepared and 0.54 mole NaAlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was added to this NaOH solution under stirring until a clear solution formed. To this basic sodium aluminate solution was added 1.0 mole of sodium silicate (28.43% SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 8.93 wt % NaOH, 41 degree, Be&prime;) in 6.6 mol H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O under vigorous stirring.

The mixture then was acidified with 0.029 mole H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>under vigorous stirring and aged at 100&deg; C. again for 20 h to obtain the as-made aluminosilicate mesostructure. The as-made mesostructure were washed thoroughly with water and dried in air. The product was calcined at 540&deg; C. for 7 h to remove the surfactant. The calcined product exhibited a single XRD line consistent with a wormhole framework structure and denoted 35%Al-MSU-S<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Ferroelectrics such as lithium niobate (an oxide) possess a large non-resonant second-order optical nonlinearity which makes such materials useful for fabrication of a variety of optical and opto-electronic devices. Examples include optical switches and modulators, frequency shifting devices, polarized controllers, pulsed waveguide lasers, surface-acoustic-wave filters, and acousto-optic devices. These materials also often possess additional useful properties, such as piezoelectric, elasto-optic, and pyroelectric effects. Conventionally, such devices are fabricated from the bulk crystal material (typically a wafer about 0.5 to 1 mm thick), although most devices use only a small fraction of the surface volume of the material. Because these oxides tend to be chemically very inert, there are only a very limited number of surface modification tools (e.g., thermal diffusion) that can be used for fabrication purposes. It would be desirable if it were possible to deposit thin films of the ferroelectric materials on a substrate while controlling the composition and purity of the deposited materials. It would also be desirable if it were possible to deposit the film in a form which can be easily etched or ablated, permitting the fabrication of photolithograhically defined two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures on a planar substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Numerous attempts have been made to grow crystalline LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and other ABO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>ferroelectrics (where A and B are other metals) on various substrates. LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>thin films, for example, have been grown on semiconductors (e.g., Si and Ge), on dielectrics (e.g., MgO and Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) and on ferroelectrics (e.g., LiTaO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>itself). In general, the objective of such deposition processes is to produce a crystalline thin film, since the crystalline form of the material usually has the best optical and electronic film qualities (e.g., optical transparency and nonlinear properties). Crystalline forms (e.g., single crystal textured, or polycrystalline) forms of these materials, however, etch very slowly with etchants current available. For example, a 50% aqueous solution of HF will have a negligible effect on single crystal LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and reactive ion etching (RIE) using CCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:Ar:O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>results in only about 3 &mgr;m/h etch rate. These etch rates are comparable to the etch rates for the masking materials that are used, making high resolution geometries essentially infeasible and resulting in very rough sidewalls with large optical losses. See J. L. Jackel, et al., &ldquo;Reactive Ion Etching of LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, &rdquo; Applied Phys. Lett., Vol. 38, 1981, pp. 970 et seq. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Among the devices that utilize LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are traveling wave electro-optic modulators. LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>traveling wave modulators are currently formed utilizing a LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>substrate containing a Mach-Zehnder waveguide geometry, a buffer layer (a thin dielectric film such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>isolating the light in the waveguide from the metal electrodes), and metal electrodes in the form of a microwave strip line. State of the art commercial traveling wave modulators (TWMs) using these structures have a 7 GHz bandwidth (corresponding to 10 Gb/s maximum transmission rate for non-return to zero (NRZ) coding) and an operating voltage at the maximum speed of V<highlight><subscript>&pgr;</subscript></highlight>&commat;7 GHz&equals;6 volts. At 40 Gb/s (30 GHz bandwidth, NRZ), numerical simulation shows that the conventional LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>TWM requires a drive voltage of about 9 volts with an electrode length L&equals;1.6 cm and thickness t<highlight><subscript>e</subscript></highlight>&equals;30 &mgr;m. However, the available gallium arsenide drive electronics at this bit rate has a maximum voltage swing of about &plusmn;4.5 volts. Thus, the conventional TWM structure would theoretically be capable of attaining the 40 Gb/s bit rate, but there is no margin of error to allow for processing variability. To account for thermal voltage degradation and process variations in the electronics, a margin of error of about 10% must be allowed (i.e., the TWM must be capable of operating at &plusmn;4 volts). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Noguchi, et al. (&ldquo;A Broadband Ti:LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>Optical Modulator with a Ridge Structure,&rdquo; J. of Lightwave Technology, Vol. 13, No. 6, June 1995, pp. 1164-1168) have shown that etching 3-4 &mgr;m deep ridges in the LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>above the Mach-Zehnder waveguides produces a better overlap between the optical and microwave fields, thereby allowing the drive voltage to be reduced. However, difficulties are encountered in making commercial devices having such structures because, as noted above, the etch rates of crystalline LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>are very slow. The resulting surfaces are rough, significantly increasing the waveguide&apos;s propagation loss. In addition, the reliability of devices made using present etching techniques is questionable. A variation of this approach is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,791 to Gill, et al., in which ion implantation is used to allow etching at an angle to form ridges with reentrant sidewalls to further shape the electric field in the ridges. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, metal oxide films, in particular lithium niobate, are formed in a state in which the films are able to be easily etched by chemical, kinetic, or optical interactions (or combinations thereof) with the deposited film, with the etched films being subsequently converted into a crystalline form that is well suited for applications in electro-optic and optical systems. Continuous, uniform amorphous films, (e.g., amorphous lithium niobate) are formed in accordance with the invention on a substrate (including single crystal lithium niobate), the regions in which the thin film is to be removed is then defined, such as by masking (e.g., as in photolithographic processes), and the film material in the exposed regions is then etched or ablated without affecting the substrate or the remaining masked thin film. The remaining deposited film is then annealed to crystallize the film to a state suitable for optical or electronic applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, a process for forming a crystalline film of lithium niobate includes providing a crystalline substrate, growing an amorphous film of lithium niobate on the substrate by chemical vapor deposition, typically at pressures between 0.1 mm Hg and at or near atmospheric pressure, and then annealing the lithium niobate film for a time and at a temperature sufficient to convert the film from an amorphous to a crystalline form. It is found that the growth of the amorphous film by chemical vapor deposition occurs much more rapidly than conventional lower pressure growth of lithium niobate crystalline films. The method of the invention may also be carried out by growing an amorphous film of lithium niobate on the substrate in a chemical vapor deposition chamber in an atmosphere containing niobium and lithium precursors and an organic chlorinating agent, before annealing the lithium niobate film. The use of the organic chlorinating agent results in higher growth rates than by conventional processes. The lithium niobate film may be formed on a lithium niobate substrate as well as other substrates, such as lithium tantalate (LiTaO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) and sapphire (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). Typically, the step of growing an amorphous film is carried out at temperatures at or below about 600&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is found that, in accordance with the present invention, the amorphous film of lithium niobate can be readily etched utilizing conventional wet or dry etchants. After surface features are etched in the amorphous film, the film may then be converted to a crystalline form by annealing. Typical annealing temperatures are in the range 900&deg; C. to 1100&deg; C. and typical annealing times are in the range of 0.5 hour to 1.0 hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that the depth of features such as trenches is not dependent on the ability to carefully control the etch rates of the amorphous film. If the substrate underlying the amorphous lithium niobate is chemically inert (e.g., crystalline lithium niobate), the depth of the etched features can be defined by the thickness of the amorphous film. That is, the inert substrate naturally serves to stop the etch process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention may also be carried out by depositing an easily etched layer, such as a layer of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, in a pattern on a base substrate. A polycrystalline layer of lithium niobate may then be deposited over the patterned layer and onto the base substrate where it is exposed. The patterned layer (e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and the lithium niobate over it may then be etched away, leaving the lithium niobate that was deposited directly on the base substrate. The remaining structure is then annealed to crystallize the remaining lithium niobate layer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For purposes of illustrating the invention and its applications, the following describes the utilization of the invention in forming optical elements such as optical modulators. An optical modulator is a device that converts data from an electrical to an optical format. For high-speed optical communications (&gt;100 Mb/s), there are basically two types of modulators in use: the electro-absorption modulator (EAM) and the electro-optic (EO) modulator. The EAM is a semiconductor-based device that absorbs light when subjected to an electric field (i.e., the quantum Stark effect). The EAM is currently deployed for fiber optic systems that operate at or below the 2.5 Gb/s rate. For higher bit rates (10 Gb/s and beyond), the EAM has several drawbacks, including: the presence of chirp (spectral broadening brought on by a change in the device&apos;s refractive index, owing to the injection of carriers), limited modulation depth, and wavelength sensitivity. The EO modulator does not have these drawbacks. However, the EO devices now fabricated in bulk LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>cannot be operated at both high speeds and low voltages and with a characteristic impedance in the preferred range of 50 ohms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The most commonly used EO modulator is based on the Mach Zehnder configuration of the type shown at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The modulator is formed in an electro-optical material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (conventionally, a substrate of single crystal lithium niobate) and includes a waveguide <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having an input path <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a first arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a second arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that are split from the input path <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at a splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an output path <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to which the first and second arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are coupled at a coupler <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Electrodes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are positioned to take advantage of the largest electro-optic coefficient in the material (e.g., r<highlight><subscript>33 </subscript></highlight>in LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). For a z-cut orientation, this corresponds to having both electrodes positioned directly above the waveguides <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, respectively. In this case, a thin (0.25-1 &mgr;m) dielectric layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (e.g., SiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) is needed to isolate the electrodes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the waveguides. Trenches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are formed in the electro-optic material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to compensate for microwave/optical velocity mismatch and to improve the microwave/optical field overlap. As discussed below, the material layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferably formed as a thin layer on a substrate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> (e.g., single crystal LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>. An electrical signal from a source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is used to produce an electric field in one arm <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (or both arms) of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; this electric field causes a change in the refractive index of the material in the arm or arms, which produces a relative change in the phase of the two light fields entering the coupler <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The preferred electro-optic material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in which the arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed is lithium niobate, LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. At high modulation rates, it is necessary that the applied electrical signal and the light in the Mach-Zehnder arm travel with near-equal or equal velocities. In order to accomplish this, the electrodes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> take the form of microwave striplines, and this type of modulator has come to be known as the traveling wave modulator (TWM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The parameters used to judge the performance of a TWM are bandwidth, the drive voltage at the maximum frequency (V<highlight><subscript>3 dB</subscript></highlight>), characteristic impedance, modulation depth, and insertion loss. The important characteristic parameters which control these performance parameters of the TWM are the following: electrode width and height, buffer layer thickness, &agr;<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(electrode loss), L (electrode length), &agr;<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>(microwave stripline/waveguide propagation loss), N<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>(microwave effective index), N<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>(optical effective index), Z (characteristic impedance), &Ggr; (the microwave/optical fields overlap), and V&pgr; &commat; DC, (switching voltage at zero modulation frequency). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Such devices preferably have a high bit rate at the lowest achievable drive voltage with the maximum modulation depth, and with an impedance that matches that of the drive electronics (typically 50&OHgr;). The reality, however, is that it is very difficult to achieve all these specifications for a high-speed device. For example, one may have a device that operates at 40 Gb/s but possesses a large V&pgr; &commat; maximum bit rate&equals;9V and low impedance of &tilde;30&OHgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows the preferred design objectives to be realized by manipulating the electro-optic material and morphological characteristics of the electro-optic material. This manipulation enables selection of both the microwave and optical properties in such a manner that all of the desired performance parameters can be simultaneously obtained. The present invention makes it possible to change the microwave effective index&mdash;without changing the optical effective index&mdash;by distributing a second dielectric material (e.g., air, SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) in a region outside optical waveguides but within the region bearing the microwave signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The ability to manipulate the material and morphological characteristics is based on the ability to grow thin films of LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>on a LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>substrate, with various degrees of crystallinity (amorphous, polycrystalline, and crystalline), and then alter the state of their crystallinity. As an example, under the proper growth conditions, films of amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can be grown on a substrate of crystalline LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Such amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can be easily etched with conventional etchants (e.g., a 4% aqueous solution of HF will etch at a rate of &gt;5 &mgr;m/min.). Thus, topological (morphological) features such as trenches, ridges, etc. can be defined by standard photolithographic processes and replicated in the amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Further, in accordance with the invention, this &ldquo;engineered&rdquo; film can be converted to a crystalline form. The electro-optic effect in LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>requires the crystalline form of the material. One way to convert the amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to crystalline LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is by heating (annealing) at a high temperature (e.g., 900&deg; C. to 1100&deg; C.) in a lithium rich environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As an example of the capabilities of this method, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> numerical simulation was made of the effect of (with reference to the type of structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) a pair of trenches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, 5 &mgr;m deep by 4 &mgr;m wide, bracketing an electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a TWM. As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the electric field emanating from the electrode <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been focused along the vertical direction into the region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> between the trenches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Without the trenches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, the electric field would radiate nearly omnidirectionally in the lower half-plane. This electric field confinement results in a significant increase in the microwave field/optical field overlap. In this particular example, the overlap, &Ggr;, is increased from &Ggr;&tilde;0.5 to 0.8. Reduced drive voltage is a direct consequence of this increased overlap. In addition, size, geometry and position of trenches permit the control of the microwave index (N<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>), and the characteristic impedance (Z). As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the direction of the electric field can be dramatically changed across boundaries with large differences in the dielectric constant. This suggests that the electric fields can be refracted or bent to improve the microwave/optical overlap (e.g., increasing the horizontal component of the electric field from surface electrodes on x-cut LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As an example, a modulator in accordance with the invention having a Mach-Zehnder structure as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be formed in a LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on a LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>substrate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. 30 &mgr;m thick electrodes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are formed over the waveguide arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a 0.5 &mgr;m dielectric layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that separates the conductors <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Numerical simulation of a 40 Gb/s NRZV (30 GHz BW) TWM modulator with this form shows an impedance of 48.5&OHgr; and a drive voltage V<highlight><subscript>&pgr;</subscript></highlight> &commat; DC of 2.8 volts (which corresponds to V3 dB electrical &commat; 30 GHz&equals;4.0 V). As a comparison, a commercial 40 Gb/s modulator available from Lucent Technology has an advertised impedance of 47&OHgr;, and a drive voltage of V<highlight><subscript>&pgr;</subscript></highlight> &commat; DC of 6 volts (which corresponds to V<highlight><subscript>&pgr;</subscript></highlight> &commat; 30 GHz&equals;8.8 V). The simulated structure thus shows approximately a 50% decrease of drive voltage over that of the present commercial level. Examples of results from the simulation are given in Table 1 below.

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A preferred LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>TWM in accordance with the invention as discussed above has a Mach Zehnder waveguide geometry, microwave stripline electrodes, and an isolating layer (called the buffer layer) between them. Exemplary fabrication steps in accordance with the invention for forming such structures are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> 1. Deposit amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on a substrate <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The substrate may be LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, or another material of lower (e.g., sapphire) or higher (e.g., silicon) refractive index than LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The film should be sufficiently thick to encompass an optical waveguide (e.g., &tilde;7 &mgr;m &commat; 1.55 &mgr;m wavelength). Dopants may be added during growth to provide for enhanced optical or microwave features (e.g., optical gain via Er<highlight><superscript>3&plus;</superscript></highlight> doping), or to introduce the optical waveguides, (e.g., with Ti). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 2. Modify film morphology. For example, define trenches <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the film surface via photolithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> 3. Anneal (e.g., at 900&deg;-1100&deg; C. for several hours) to convert the remaining amorphous material layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to crystalline LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 4. If necessary, pole the LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>thin film <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by applying an electric field (e.g., &tilde;22 kV/mm for congruent LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 5. Fabricate waveguide elements <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Typical methods include diffusion of Ti strips or proton exchange across an open feature in a mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> 6. Overlay low index buffer layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 7. Photolithographically define electrodes <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This may involve electroplating to bring the electrode to the desired thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram of a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor that may be utilized in forming the layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an atmospheric pressure CVD reactor that may be utilized. The reactor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> uses inductive heating via an external coil, whereas the reactor of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> uses an external oven and/or may use a flammable gas to be burned with the injected precursors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A first film exemplary growth process for the LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is the following: A carrier gas (e.g., N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), mixed with O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(e.g., 75% N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 25% O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), is bubbled through precursor solutions containing metal alkoxides (e.g., lithium t-butoxide (Li-t-OBu), niobium ethoxide (NbOEt), or lithium-niobium ethoxide (LiNb(Oet)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>). The solutions may be heated to enhance the volatilization of the solutions. The vaporized precursor is injected via nozzles <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into a reactor tube <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which has a substrate holder <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> that supports the substrate(s) <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> onto which the LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>film is to be deposited. Precursor gas flow rates are controlled. Pressure in the reactor tube <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is typically in the range between 0.1 Torr and atmospheric pressure. The whole tube <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and its contents may be heated (e.g., via an oven), or the substrate <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> alone may be heated via an alternating electric field from a coil <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> coupled to a resistive substrate holder <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (induction heating). The substrate holder <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> may be rotated to make the deposition more uniform. Growth of amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>occurs typically in a temperature range at or below 600&deg; C. Deposition rates are about 2 &mgr;m/h. Deposition rates can be increased by introducing active carrier gases such as trimethylcholorsilane to reduce concentration of gaseous components containing hydroxyl groups. The amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>film etches at a rate of about 5 &mgr;m/min in an aqueous 25% solution of HF. The amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>film is then annealed at 900&deg; C.-1100&deg; C. for several (e.g., 6) hours in a ceramic container with powdered LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Previous chemical-based LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>film growth has been limited to &tilde;100 nm/h. In accordance with the invention, the first process as discussed above carries out CVD growth at higher (near atmospheric) pressures to suppress the desorption processes responsible for poor growth rates, allowing growth rates &tilde;2 &mgr;m/h to be attained. A second process, in accordance with the invention, is based upon an elucidation of the film growth chemistry, and uses a reactive carrier gas to modify the growth chemistry so as to increase growth rates. This second approach has several important consequences. Film growth experiments indicate that the addition of a common organic chlorinating agent, trimethylchlorosilane, Me<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiCl, to the chamber along with the Nb(OEt)<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>precursor results in a doubling of the growth rate. Concommittant synthetic experiments have shown that Me<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiCl easily chlorinates Nb(OEt)<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>at room temperature, yielding mixed Nb(OEt)<highlight><subscript>5&minus;n</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>species, along with the volatile and stable silyl ether by-product, Me<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiOEt. For example, a 1:1 mixture of Nb(OEt)<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>and Me<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiCl monitored by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) over 3 days reveals the gradual disappearance of peaks due to Nb(OEt)<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, and the appearance of peaks due to Nb(OEt)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Cl: terminal OCH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>1.205 ppm, triplet, J&equals;7.0 Hz; bridging OCH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>1.451 ppm, triplet, J&equals;7.0 Hz; terminal OCH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>4.573 ppm, quartet, J&equals;Hz; bridging OCH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>4.479 ppm, broad unresolved multiplet. Similarly, the <highlight><superscript>93</superscript></highlight>Nb NMR peak due to Nb(OEt)<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>decreases in intensity over the course of the reaction, while a peak at &minus;1124 ppm (upfield from &lsqb;Et4N&rsqb;&lsqb;NbCl<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;), attributed to Nb(OEt)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Cl, grows in intensity. The generation of the Me<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiOEt by-product is confirmed by the observation of <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H peaks at 1.088 ppm (triplet, J&equals;7.0 Hz, CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), 3.495 ppm (quartet, J&equals;7.0 Hz, CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), and a singlet at 0.63 ppm (SiMe<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). These results reveal the facile, co-operative inter-ligand decomposition mechanism that is responsible for the higher growth rates observed in the presence of Me<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiCl. Further work has shown that the kinetics of the precursor decomposition process, and the thermal stability of the intermediates, can be modulated by both the substitution number, n, and the nature of R in the generic intermediate NbCl<highlight><subscript>5&minus;n</subscript></highlight>(OEt)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>. For example, reaction of the frequently used Nb precursor NbCl<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>with ethanol in a 1:1 ratio at room temperature generated not the anticipated NbCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>(OEt), but the species Nb(&boxH;O)Cl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(identified by single crystal X-ray diffraction) and the volatile products HCl and ethyl chloride, EtCl (identified by gas phase infrared spectroscopy). Of utmost importance is that the volatile organic, ethanol, reacts readily at low temperatures to convert a Nb&mdash;Cl bond to a Nb&boxH;O moiety, precisely the chemical film component desired for the formation of LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>from Nb<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>. Again, the by-products, HCl and EtCl, are stable gases, easily removed from the film growth surface. Thus for the series NbCl<highlight><subscript>5&minus;n</subscript></highlight>(OMe)<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, ease of precursor decomposition decreases, and compound stability increases, with an increasing value of n. Expanding on these results we have found that the stability of NbCl<highlight><subscript>5&minus;n</subscript></highlight>(OEt)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>likewise increases with n, and are on a whole significantly more stable than the ethoxide derivatives. For example, while for n&equals;1, the ethoxide NbCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>(OEt) decomposes at room temperature, NbCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>(OMe) decomposes at &tilde;75&deg; C., and the methoxide NbCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(OMe)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is stable to over 170&deg; C. Thus, any number of precursor-carrier gas combinations may be utilized, which are able to satisfy a large range of kinetic and thermodynamic film growth or processing requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Structures made of materials with a different dielectric constant, such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, can be overgrown with the amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can then be crystallized by the aforementioned annealing process. Furthermore, amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can be grown and crystallized on either z-cut or x-cut LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>can also be grown as a crystalline material on other substrates such as sapphire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The lithium niobate film growth procedure by chemical vapor deposition at atmospheric pressure includes two steps: the first step&mdash;deposition of an amorphous lithium niobate film at a temperature at or below 600&deg; C. and the second step&mdash;crystallization annealing at a temperature in the range from 900&deg; C. through 1100&deg; C. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system that can be used for lithium niobate growth in accordance with this process. A carrier gas canister <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, typically containing a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen or helium (e.g., 23% oxygen, 77% nitrogen) is connected through a valve <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and supply lines <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to mass flow controllers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The mass flow controller <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> controls the supply of carrier gas to a precursor bubbler <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> for lithium t-butoxide (Li(OBut), and the mass flow controller <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> controls the supply of carrier gas to a precursor bubbler <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for niobium ethoxide (Nb(OEt)<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>). An outlet line <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> with valve <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> extends from the bubbler <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and an outlet line <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with valve <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> extends from the bubbler <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to a mixing zone <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of the gas inlet system of a CVD furnace <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Oxygen may also be supplied to the furnace from a canister <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> through a valve <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, mass flow controller <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and supply line <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. The substrates <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to be treated are held on a substrate carrier <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> within a reactor enclosure <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the furnace. Alternatively, a radio frequency(RF) coil may be utilized, if desired, to inductively heat the substrates. A temperature sensor <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> (e.g., a thermocouple) is used to monitor the temperature adjacent the substrates <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The delivery gas lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> preferably are always kept at a temperature over 150&deg; C. to prevent deposition inside the lines, and the bubblers <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are heated to get the pressure of the precursors into the range of 0.1-1 Torr (e.g., 150&deg; C. and 190&deg; C. for niobium penta-ethoxide and lithium t-butoxide respectively.) The optimal flow rates are about 0.5 slpm. At these conditions the film deposition (growth) rate can be about 2 microns per hour or even higher (lower growth temperature results in higher growth rate). The films growing at the first step show different degrees of crystallinity depending on the growth temperature. Films grown at temperatures below 650&deg; C. are an amorphous lithium niobate, and films grown at temperatures in the range from 700&deg; C. to 900&deg; C. are polycrystalline material. (Note that films grown even at 600&deg; C. could be expitaxial&mdash;i.e., crystalline&mdash;if the growth rate is smaller than 0.2 microns per hour.) In accordance with the present invention, amorphous and polycrystalline lithium niobate are recrystallized by high temperature annealing (annealing temperature&gt;900&deg; C.). In contrast to the as-grown sample for which X-ray diffraction reveals featured polycrystalline arcs, annealed samples exhibit good crystal structure. This two-step growth method allows the growth of epitaxial lithium niobate films with a growth rate over 1 micron per hour. For comparison, crystalline lithium niobate films grown at temperatures&gt;900&deg; C. have growth rates below 0.1 microns per hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The following are examples of processes carried out with the atmospheric pressure CVD system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to grow amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>films. Substrates (about 1 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, c-cut LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) were loaded into the horizontal reactor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, which was heated in the furnace <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Before growth the substrates were annealed at 1100&deg; C. for 1 hour. Growth of amorphous films was typically carried out at about 650&deg; C. Films were deposited from lithium t-butoxide and niobium ethoxide (maintained at 190&deg; C. and 150&deg; C., respectively). The delivery gas line <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> was kept at 150&deg; C. to prevent deposition inside the line. A carrier gas of 23% oxygen and 77% nitrogen was bubbled through the precursors at a flow rate &tilde;0.5 slpm. Film growth rate and film crystallinity are highly dependent on reactor temperature. Under the conditions employed here, a growth rate of &tilde;2 &mgr;m/h was observed at reactor temperatures between &tilde;500&deg; C. and 750&deg; C. The chemical composition of the amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>films was examined with Auger electron spectroscopy using films grown on (111) Si to obviate surface charging. No elemental carbon was detected in a typical film. The amorphous films were crystallized by annealing them in a closed ceramic container containing powdered LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. To further insure an adequate lithium oxide pressure over the films, the samples were also covered with a bulk LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>wafer segment. Annealing was performed for one hour at 900&deg; C.-1100&deg;C. Thickness measurements on patterned films were performed with a profileometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> High growth rates or lower growth temperatures generate amorphous, as opposed to polycrystalline or epitaxial, lithium niobate films. Films grown between about 500&deg; to 650&deg; C. were amorphous, as evidenced by a diffuse x-ray diffraction band overlaying weak diffraction peaks from the substrate. After a one hour post-growth anneal at 1100&deg; C., X-ray diffraction scans using a 2-D X-ray detector and pole plots derived from them show the previously amorphous film grown at 650&deg; C. to be single crystal. The single-crystal epitaxial nature of the annealed LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>layer was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL 2010F field emission transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The cross-sectional TEM image of the LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>layer after annealing taken under &lsqb;{overscore (2)} 110&rsqb; two-beam bright field conditions were consistent with single crystal structure. No interface between the film and the substrate, or associated defects, was visible under different sets of two-beam imaging conditions, consistent with a high quality crystalline film and intermixing at the interface. Analysis of selected area diffraction patterns (SADPs) obtained from different areas of the film only, and also form areas containing both the film and substrate, confirmed that LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>film is epitaxial single crystal. The typical SADP taken from the same area containing both the film and the substrate consists of one set of spots and corresponds to the &lsqb;01 {overscore (1)} 0&rsqb; zone of the rhombohedral LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>crystal structure with a&equals;0.515 nm, c&equals;1.386 nm, space group R3c (<highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>). This SADP demonstrates that there is no difference in crystal structure, orientation or crystal quality between the deposited and annealed LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>film and the substrate. The TEM analysis proved the high-quality crystallized LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>layer to be free of segregations of a second phase and extended defects. Films grown at higher temperatures (about 700&deg; to 750&deg; C.) exhibited diffraction rings in the X-ray spectra characteristic of polycrystalline films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Advantage can be taken of the rapid etch rate of amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(&tilde;7 &mgr;m/min. in 4% HF at room temperature) to pattern the film before annealing to crystallinity, e.g., photolithographically patterning, HF:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O etching and then annealing the LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>film. A non-optimized RIE etch using a 29:2::CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>:O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas mixture and 50 W RF power was found to etch the amorphous LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>about 20-fold faster than for crystalline or polycrystalline LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>under the same conditions. The bulk film diffusion processes which occur at annealing temperatures during crystallization are found to be more effective than the surface mobility in altering the structure of the resulting film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A lift-off technique may also be used in accordance with the invention to shape lithium niobate thin films. As an example, a photolithographically patterned SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mask atop a crystalline lithium niobate substrate was overgrown with polycrystalline lithium niobate, with the lithium niobate grown on the substrate where it is exposed by the patterned SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/lithium niobate mask was etched away in an aqueous HF solution to leave the lithium niobate grown on the substrate, and the structure was annealed. The resulting patterned film featured 1 &mgr;m thick by 40 &mgr;m wide single crystal LiNbO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>ridges (as determined by X-ray diffraction). Lift-off processes are not often successfully applied to perovskite films because the high temperatures necessary for epitaxial perovskite growth typically induce reaction or interdiffusion of the oxide and the mask material. As the deposition of amorphous lithium niobate in the present process takes place at much lower temperatures than epitaxial growth, mask-oxide interactions are less of an issue, and lift-off processes can be used as patterning technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Various precursors may be used in the processes in accordance with the invention. These include, for example, niobium penta-alkoxides (e.g., methoxides, ethoxides, iso-propoxides) and lithium-niobium alkoxides (e.g., methoxides, ethoxides, and iso-propoxides). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As noted above, amorphous lithium niobate has a much higher etching rate for wet etching with common liquid etchants such as HF acid, as well as for dry etching with dry etchants such as a CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>:O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mixture. In both cases the etching rate can be higher than 2 microns per hour (for comparison, the wet etching rate of crystalline and polycrystalline lithium niobate is below 0.1 micron per hour), permitting the practical development of planar technology in lithium niobate devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth herein as illustrative, but embraces all such forms thereof as come within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Reactive foils and their uses are provided as localized heat sources useful, for example, in ignition, joining and propulsion. An improved reactive foil is preferably a freestanding multilayered foil structure made up of alternating layers selected from materials that will react with one another in an exothermic and self-propagating reaction. Upon reacting, this foil supplies highly localized heat energy that may be applied, for example, to joining layers, or directly to bulk materials that are to be joined. This foil heat-source allows rapid bonding to occur at room temperature in virtually any environment (e.g., air, vacuum, water, etc.). If a joining material is used, the foil reaction will supply enough heat to melt the joining materials, which upon cooling will form a strong bond, joining two or more bulk materials. If no joining material is used, the foil reaction supplies heat directly to at least two bulk materials, melting a portion of each bulk, which upon cooling, form a strong bond. Additionally, the foil may be designed with openings that allow extrusion of the joining (or bulk) material through the foil to enhance bonding. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to reactive multilayer foils, especially freestanding multilayer foils, useful as local heat sources. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Reactive multilayer coatings are useful in a wide variety of applications requiring the generation of intense, controlled amounts of heat in a planar region. Such structures conventionally comprise a succession of substrate-supported coatings that, upon appropriate excitation, undergo an exothermic chemical reaction that spreads across the area covered by the layers generating precisely controlled amounts of heat. While we will describe these reactive coatings primarily as sources of heat for welding, soldering or brazing, they can also be used in other applications requiring controlled local generation of heat such as propulsion and ignition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In many methods of bonding or joining materials, a heat source is required. This heat source may either be external or internal to the structure to be joined. When external, the heat may be generated from a device such as a furnace. Processes incorporating such heat sources require the heating of the entire unit to be bonded, including the bulk materials and the bond material, to a temperature high enough to melt the bond material. Such a method presents problems because the bulk materials to be joined are often delicate or sensitive to the high temperatures required in the process. These high temperatures may damage the materials to be bonded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To alleviate the problems associated with external heat sources, internal heat sources are utilized. These heat sources often take the form of reactive powders or even electrical wires. When reactive powders are used, a mixture of metals or compounds that will react exothermically in a self-propagating reaction to form a final compound or alloy is utilized. Such processes have existed since self-propagating powders were developed in the early 1960s, spawning what is known as Self-Propagating, High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS). SHS reactions, however, often require substantial preheating to self-propagate, and controlling the rate and manner in which their energy is released is often difficult. As a result, bonding may be inconsistent or insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To combat the problems associated with reactive powder bonding, multilayer structures comprised of materials, which allow similar exothermic reactions, have been developed. Such structures allow for more controllable and consistent heat generating reactions. The basic driving force behind such SHS reactions is a reduction in atomic bond energy. When a structure having a series of layers of reactive material (known as a foil) is ignited, heat is produced as the distinct layers atomically combine. This heat ignites adjacent regions of the foil, thereby allowing the reaction to travel the entire length of the structure, generating heat until all material is reacted. Even with such advances in bonding technology, however, there remain problems. Many materials, for example, posed major difficulties and previously could not be successfully bonded. Additionally, methods utilizing reactive foils as heat sources often resulted in the foil debonding from the substrate upon reaction, thereby weakening the bond. Accordingly there is a need for improved reactive multilayer foils. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Reactive foils and their uses are provided as localized heat sources useful, for example, in ignition, joining and propulsion. An improved reactive foil is preferably a freestanding multilayered foil structure made up of alternating layers selected from materials that will react with one another in an exothermic and self-propagating reaction. Upon reacting, this foil supplies highly localized heat energy that may be applied, for example, to joining layers, or directly to bulk materials that are to be joined. This foil heat-source allows rapid bonding to occur at room temperature in virtually any environment (e.g., air, vacuum, water, etc.). If a joining material is used, the foil reaction will supply enough heat to melt the joining materials, which upon cooling will form a strong bond, joining two or more bulk materials. If no joining material is used, the foil reaction supplies heat directly to at least two bulk materials, melting a portion of each bulk, which upon cooling, form a strong bond. Additionally, the foil may be designed with openings that allow extrusion of the joining (or bulk) material through the foil to enhance bonding. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments and applications of the invention will now be described. Other embodiments may be realized and compositional or structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Although the embodiments disclosed herein have been particularly described as joining or bonding bulk materials utilizing a freestanding, self-propagating reactive foil structure, it should be readily apparent that the invention may be embodied for other uses or applications requiring an intense localized heat source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a multilayer reactive structure (generically referred to herein as a &ldquo;foil&rdquo;) is provided as a local heat source in a variety of applications such as a process for joining two or more (of the same or different) materials together. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, reactive multilayer foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made up of alternating layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of materials A and B, respectively. These alternating layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be any materials amenable to mixing of neighboring atoms (or having changes in chemical bonding) in response to a stimulus, including silicides (e.g., Rh/Si, Ni/Si, and Zr/Si, etc.), aluminides (e.g., Ni/Al, Ti/Al, Monel/Al, and Zr/Al, etc.), borides (e.g. Ti/B), carbides (e.g., Ti/C), thermite reacting compounds (e.g., Al/Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or Al/Cu<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O), alloys, metallic glasses, and composites (e.g., metal ceramic). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The materials (A/B) used in fabrication of the reactive foil are preferably chemically distinct. In a preferred embodiment, layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> alternate between a transition metal (e.g., Ti, Ni, etc.) and a light element (e.g., B, Al, etc.). Preferably, the pairs (A/B) of elements are chosen based on the way they react to form stable compounds with large negative heats of formation and high adiabatic reaction temperatures, as described in T. P. Weihs, &ldquo;Self-Propagating Reactions in Multilayer Materials,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Handbook of Thin Film Process Technology, </italic></highlight>1997, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the layers of the reactive foil is (or contains) Al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When a multilayer foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is exposed to a stimulus (e.g., spark, energy pulse, etc.), for example at one end, neighboring atoms from materials A and B mix, e.g. as shown in region <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The change in chemical bonding caused by this mixing results in a reduction in atomic bond energy, thus generating heat in an exothermic chemical reaction. This change in chemical bonding occurs as layers with A-A bonds (i.e., layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>) and layers with B-B bonds (i.e., layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) are exchanged for A-B bonds, thereby reducing the chemical energy stored in each layer, and generating heat. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> further illustrates, this generated heat diffuses through foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (in a direction from reacted section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through reaction zone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to unreacted section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) and initiates additional mixing of the unreacted layers. As a result, a self-sustaining/self propagating reaction (SHS reaction) is produced through foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. With sufficiently large and rapid heat generation, the reaction propagates across the entire foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at velocities typically greater than 1 m/s. As the reaction does not require additional atoms from the surrounding environment (as, for example, oxygen in the case of combustion), the reaction makes foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> a self-contained source of energy capable of emitting bursts of heat and light rapidly, reaching temperatures above 1400 K, and a local heating rate reaching 10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>K/s. This energy is particularly useful in applications (e.g., joining, ignition, etc.) requiring production of heat rapidly and locally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When a reaction propagates across a multilayer foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the maximum temperature of the reaction is typically located at the trailing edge of the reaction zone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This may be considered the final temperature of reaction, which can be determined by the heat of reaction (&Dgr;H<highlight><subscript>TX</subscript></highlight>), the heat lost to the environment or surrounding material (&Dgr;H<highlight><subscript>env</subscript></highlight>), the average heat capacity of the sample (C<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>), and the mass of the sample, M. Another factor in determining the final temperature is whether or not the reaction temperature exceeds the melting point of the final product. If the melting point is exceeded, then some heat is absorbed in the state transformation from solid to liquid of the product. The final temperature of reaction may be determined using the following formulas (where T<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is the initial temperature, &Dgr;H<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is the enthalpy of melting, T<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>is the melting temperature of the product, and there is no reaction with the surrounding environment or material), depending upon whether final product melting occurs:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> If the final product completely melts.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Intricately related to the heat of the foil reaction is the velocity of the propagation of the reaction along the length of foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The speed at which the reaction can propagate depends on how rapidly the atoms diffuse normal to their layering (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and how rapidly heat is conducted along the length of foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The propagation velocity is a strong function of the thicknesses of the individual layers in the multilayer foil. As the thickness of individual layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> decreases, the diffusion distances are smaller and atoms can mix more rapidly. Heat is released at a higher rate, and therefore the reaction travels faster through the foil structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, reactive multilayer foils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be fabricated by physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods. A magnetron sputtering technique, for example, may be used to deposit the materials A/B on a substrate (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in dashed outline form as layer <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>) as alternating layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Substrate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be rotated over two sputter guns in a manner well known in the art to effectuate the layering of materials A/B into alternating layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Substrate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is shown in dashed outline form to indicate that it is a removable layer that facilitates fabrication of the reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as a freestanding foil. Substrate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be any substrate (e.g., Si, glass, or other underlayer) having the characteristics of providing sufficient adhesion so as to keep the foil layers on the substrate during deposition, but not too adhesive to prevent the foil from being removed from the substrate following deposition. The substrate can include a coating of release material or adhesion material to fine tune its adhesion characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Advantageously an additional wetting layer (e.g., tin) may be used as an interface layer between the first layer of foil (<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) and the substrate <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to provide the necessary adhesive. When no wetting layer is employed, selection of the appropriate material A/B as the first layer deposited on the substrate will ensure that the necessary adhesive requirements are met. When a reactive foil using Al/Monel as materials A/B is to be fabricated, for example, without a wetting layer, the exemplary reactive foil would be deposited on a substrate such as Si with the first layer being Al deposited on the substrate. Al is preferably selected as the first layer in such case because Al will sufficiently adhere to Si during depositing, but will allow peeling off of the substrate after the foil is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A fabricated foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may have hundreds to thousands of alternating layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> stacked on one another. Individual layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> preferably have a thickness ranging from 1-1000 nm. In a preferred embodiment, the total thickness of foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may range from 10 &mgr;m to 1 cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Another method of fabricating is to deposit material in a codeposition geometry. Using this method, both material sources are directed onto one substrate and the atomic fluxes from each material source are shuttered to deposit the alternate layers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. An alternative method is to eliminate shuttering altogether and rotate substrates over two material sources that have physically distinct atomic fluxes. With this method, each pass over a source preferably generates an individual layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Preferably the degree of atomic intermixing of materials A/B that may occur during deposition should be minimized. This may be accomplished by depositing the multilayers onto cooled substrates, particularly when multilayers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are sputter deposited. To the extent that some degree of intermixing is unavoidable, a relatively thin (as compared to the alternating unreacted layers) region of pre-reacted material <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be formed. Such a pre-reacted region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, nevertheless, is helpful in that it serves to prevent further and spontaneous reaction in foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, a multilayer reactive foil may be fabricated using mechanical techniques such as repeated rolling of layered composites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the preferred reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a freestanding multilayer reactive foil for particular use as a heat-generating source. Freestanding foils are easier to characterize than thin films because they can be handled like &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; samples. Making reactive foils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> freestanding greatly expands their possible uses. Because such reactive foils are not necessarily associated with any particular application, they may be mass-produced for any purpose requiring a self-propagating localized heat source. Their production is not limited or impeded by placing large or delicate items into a vacuum chamber to be coated by a reactive multilayer foil. Moreover, freestanding foils will allow heat sinking to the substrate to be minimized where unwanted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Freestanding foils in accordance with preferred embodiments of the invention may be adapted for use in a variety of applications. For example, the freestanding foils may be used to couple bodies of materials (referred to herein as &ldquo;bulk materials&rdquo;) together to form a unified product. Freestanding foils may find use in any number of bonding, soldering, brazing, welding or other applications to join bulk materials. A typical joining application is represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in which two or more bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are to be joined together. The bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be ceramics, metallic glasses, metals/alloys, polymers, composites, semiconductors, and other forms of material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the particular joining application illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, joining material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used to join bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together. Joining material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be any layer (or composite layer) of material to be melted to join bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together. Joining material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be in the form of freestanding sheets made up of metallic glasses, metals/alloys, functionally graded layers, Ni&mdash;B films, solder, brazes, self-propagating braze, combinations of such, or other like joining materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is positioned between joining materials <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to form a structure somewhat like a sandwich. The reactive foil &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; thus formed is preferably positioned between bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the location (e.g., end point, joint, intersection, etc.) at which the bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are to be joined together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is positioned between bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which have previously been coated with joining materials <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As another alternative, a reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is positioned between joining materials <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to form a structure somewhat like a sandwich. The reactive foil &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; thus formed is preferably positioned between bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the location (e.g., end point, joint, intersection, etc.) at which the bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are to be joined together. The bulk materials are first coated with joining materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The joining process involves the application of force (as symbolically represented by vice <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to maintain the relative positions of bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, joining materials <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Advantageously all components are freestanding elements pressed together. In an alternative embodiment, joining materials <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are pressed as a composite with reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Once the components of the joining process are positioned, a stimulus (shown as lighted match <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is applied, preferably, to one end of reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to initiate an SHS reaction. The intermixing of atoms within reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> produces rapid and intense heat sufficient to melt joining materials <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along the entire length of reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In this state, joining materials <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are sufficient to join bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together. Shortly thereafter, the joined materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> return to the temperature of the environment (e.g., room temperature) and can be removed from the applied force (graphically represented by vice <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A composite structure composed of joining materials <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be formed through deposition (e.g., vapor depositing) of reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> onto one layer of joining material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Another layer of joining material is then combined with reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through vapor deposition or an application of force (e.g., cold rolling). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Advantageously a wetting/adhesion layer may be added to facilitate surface wetting for the reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or both. The wetting/adhesion layer allows uniform spreading of joining material to ensure consistent joining of bulk materials. The wetting/adhesion layer may be a thin layer of joining material (e.g., braze), Ti, Sn, metallic glass, etc. Commercial alloys such as Ag&mdash;Sn, Ag&mdash;Cu&mdash;Ti, Cu&mdash;Ti, Au&mdash;Sn, and Ni&mdash;B may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the invention are useable as freestanding reactive foils <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with increased total thickness. The total thickness of such a reactive foil depends upon the thickness and number of the elemental layers (e.g., <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>) utilized to form the foils. Foils that are less than 10 &mgr;m are very hard to handle as they tend to curl up on themselves. Foils on the order of 100 &mgr;m are stiff, and thus, easily handled. Thicker foils also minimize the risk of a self-propagating reaction being quenched in the foils. In joining applications using reactive foils, there is a critical balance between the rate at which the foil generates heat and the rate at which that heat is conducted into the surrounding braze layers and the joint to be formed. If heat is conducted away faster than it is generated, the reaction will be quenched and the joint cannot be formed. The thicker foils make it harder to quench the reaction because there is a larger volume generating heat and the same surface area through which heat is lost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Thicker foils can be utilized with reaction temperatures that are lower, generally leading to more stable foils. Foils with high formation reaction temperatures are generally unstable and brittle and therefore are dangerous and difficult to use. Brittle foils, for example, will crack easily, leading to local hot spots (through the release of elastic strain energy and friction) that ignite the foil. Cutting such brittle foils (e.g., for specific joint sizes) is very difficult to do as they are more likely to crack into unusable pieces or igniting during the cutting process. Freestanding thick foils offer the advantage of overcoming problems associated with thermal shock and densification problems that have presented obstacles in known processes. Both phenomena relate to rapid changes in the dimensions of the foils. On reacting, the foils will heat rapidly and will try to expand beyond the substrate that constrains them. This leads to a thermal shock and foils that are deposited on substrates can debond, thereby causing inconsistent and less effective bonding. As the reaction proceeds, the foils will also density, due to the change in chemical bond. This densification, can also cause debonding from a substrate and inconsistent and ineffective bonding. By making the foil freestanding in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, no debonding occurs, the foil is easily manipulated and handled, and thus the reactive foil is made available to a greater variety of applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the thicker reactive foils are on the order of 50 &mgr;m to 1 cm thick. Although a number of different systems may be employed to create the thick freestanding reactive foils, a unique process in selecting the fabrication conditions for the employed system should be carefully selected. For example, deposition conditions such as sputter gas and substrate temperature are advantageously chosen so that stresses remain sufficiently low in the films of the foil as they are grown in the system. Since the stress in the film times its thickness scales with the driving force for delamination, the product of stress and thickness should be kept below 1000 N/m. Stresses often arise in the films during the fabrication process. As the films grow thicker, they are more likely to peel off their substrates or crack their substrates than thinner films, thereby ruining the final foil production. By characterizing the stresses in the films and selecting conditions to minimize the stresses, the fabrication process can be completed without the premature peeling off of the foil or the cracking of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, openings in a reactive foil are intentionally designed in the foil structure. These openings are of particular use in facilitating and enhancing joining applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The foil may be initially fabricated, for example, with one or more openings or perforations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the foil structure, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Preferably the openings are formed in a periodic pattern, such as a rectangular array, across the foil area. Any known method may be employed to create openings. For example, sputter depositing of the foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on a removable substrate with patterned holes may be used. The openings may also be formed by depositing the foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> onto a substrate, depositing photoresist on the foil, patterning the photoresist with photolithography, and then etching the underlying foil through the patterned holes. A further exemplary technique involves physically punching holes in foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably the openings have effective diameters in the range of 10-10,000 micrometers. (The effective diameter of a non-circular opening is the diameter of a circular opening of equal area.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the openings in foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allow joining material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or bulk material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in some circumstances, to extrude (as shown by arrows <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) through these perforations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> upon being heated and melted by the exothermic reaction of foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Upon this extrusion, one layer of joining material <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or bulk material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, may contact and couple with another layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or bulk material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, on the opposite side of the freestanding foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The patterned perforations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> permit enhanced bonding of bulk materials <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and each other making stronger and more consistent bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a microphotograph showing two copper bodies <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> bonded by silver solder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that has extruded through openings, e.g. <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in a reacted foil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Utilizing one or more embodiments of the invention, a number of different applications can now be performed more effectively and efficiently. For example, metallic glass bulk materials can now be joined, where the end product is a single structure made up solely of metallic glass, including the bond and reacted foil layer. It is also now possible to join bulk materials with very different chemical compositions, thermal properties, and other physical properties, that historically presented many difficulties in bonding. Semiconductor or microelectronic devices may be bonded to circuit boards or other structures, and at the same time, multiple leads may be created that are intricately associated with the devices. Semiconductor and microelectronic devices may also be sealed hermetically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> These joining applications are enhanced by the invention in that potential for heat damage, normally associated with such applications as soldering, brazing, and welding, is avoided or at least minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Moreover, utilizing embodiments of the invention, the bulk materials being joined may be freestanding. This means that prior to the actual joining of the bulk materials, the individual bulk substrates do not need any braze layer deposited directly upon them. Additionally, the bulk substrates do not necessarily require any pre-bonding of the reactive foil or other pre-treatment. The bulk materials involved may simply be held securely to either a freestanding braze layer or the freestanding reactive foil at the time of bonding for a strong and permanent joint to be created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention allow bonding at least one bulk that is a metallic glass. No braze need be associated with that bulk in the joining process. This is because the reactive foil may be designed to bond directly with a metallic glass upon reaction. To accomplish this joining process, the reactive foil can itself react to form a metallic glass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention further allow for superior bonding when the bulk materials include microchips or semiconductor devices. In the bonding of semiconductor devices to a substrate such as a circuit board, potential for damage to the device is a factor that must be taken into consideration. By using a freestanding reactive foil to join such a semiconductor device to a substrate, little heat is generated that can be damaging to the device or to adjacent components. The semiconductor devices may be situated on the substrate with greater freedom and ease. As described below, specific foil compositions, such as Ni/Al or Monel/Al, may be utilized. Foils of such composition are not only far easier to handle than those of the past, but the combination of Ni, Cu and Al enables freestanding foils to have a high thermal and electrical conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> When bonding is directed to bulk materials such as semiconductor devices, the reactive foil may have composition patterning properties. The embodiments allow the fabrication of alternating adjacent electrically insulating and conducting regions in the final reacted foil, thereby allowing a multitude of leads to be bonded and electrically isolated with a single reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, less energy is required to perform a joining application utilizing reactive foils. Functionally graded layers as joining material allow for control over melting temperatures through selection of their composite materials. Functionally graded layers may be utilized, for example, because their melting temperature may be controlled. Ni&mdash;B films used as joining material allow for low temperature melting where the melting temperature begins at a relatively low temperature and elevates as B diffuses out of Ni, resulting in a final material with a relatively high melting point. By requiring less energy from the foil reaction, the overall heat applied to the total structure to be bonded can be reduced, thereby minimizing damage to the materials to be bonded due to the foil reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, one may include layers of reactive multilayer braze within the reactive multilayer foil. For example, in a foil comprising reactive layers of Al and reactive layers of Ti, Zr or Hf alloys, one may include one or more reactive braze layers comprising a Cu or a Ni alloy. The reactive multilayer braze would provide an energy source as the layers mix and form the joining material, in addition to the energy provided by the reactive foil. The combination of reactive multilayer foil and reactive multilayer brazes permits the use of reactive brazes that may not self-propagate without the foil. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The invention may now be more clearly understood by consideration of the following specific examples: </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Reactive foils of Al and Ni are formed by cold rolling many 5 &mgr;m sheets of Ni and Al that are stacked together. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> schematically illustrates fabrication of the foil <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by passage of the stack <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> between rollers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B. The sheets can be cold-rolled several times until the layers are reduced to the desired thickness. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Instead of utilizing foils comprised of multilayers of uniform thickness, a composite foil is used, in which nanolaminate reactive multilayers are deposited onto reactive microlaminate foils. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> certain sections of layers <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> within the reactive foil <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> will be of a nanoscale (nanolaminate), while other sections <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> will be of micron-thick layers (microlaminate). The nanolaminate, as described above, will react easily and the reaction, once started, will self-propagate along the length of the foil without being quenched by the melting of the surrounding braze layers or bulk components. Thus, the nanolaminate can be viewed as an igniter for the microlaminate. The section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with microscale layers may not be able to sustain a self-propagating reaction at room temperature, but when heated by adjacent nanolaminate sections <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, it will sustain such a reaction. The foil can comprise alternate layers of Al and Ni. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In fabricating these composite foils, sheets of Al and Ni are rolled to form the microlaminate section and then a nanolaminate foil is vapor deposited onto either side of this microlaminate structure. Fabrication may also be performed through vapor deposition of the full composite with the microlaminate layers deposited at much higher rates without igniting the foil or causing unacceptable intermixing between the alternating layers during deposition. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A reactive multilayer braze is formed that is similar to the reactive foils described above, which reacts to form a metallic glass. This multilayer braze gives off heat upon a reaction of its alternating layers. Through a careful selection of reactants that are know to be good glass formers, the braze will form an amorphous final product upon reaction, similar to those in commercial use and to the foils described above. The heat generated by the reacting braze layers reduces the amount of reactive foil required for joining. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 5 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Certain compositions of foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may react to form amorphous alloys (metallic glass). Those foils may be combinations of layers of alloys that comprise Ni or Cu, alloys that comprise Ti, Zr, or Hf, and alloys that comprise Al as such will react to form metallic glass. When using such foils, certain properties may be attained. Metallic glasses have very good wetting capabilities. The braze layer may be excluded when using such a foil to join bulk metallic glass and in such a circumstance, once the foil reacts and is joined with the metallic glass, a single bulk metallic glass may be produced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A semiconductor or microelectronic device is joined to a substrate such as a printed circuit board using a reactive multi-layer foil. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> schematically illustrates the joining arrangement wherein the reactive foil <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between solder layers <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>B, and the sandwich is disposed between the contact lead <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for the device <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and the contact surface <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the board. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 7 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A patterned reactive foil is designed so that some sections react to form electrically conductive regions and other sections form non-conductive regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> schematically illustrate the concept. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows the foil <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> before reaction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> is after the reaction. Regions <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, comprising alternate layers of Al and Ni, react to form conductive regions <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. Regions <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, comprise insulators, such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or silicon nitride, or alternate layers that react to form non-conductive regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that in use, regions <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> would be registered between contacts above and below the foil <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to be electrically connected through the regions <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> after the reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> It can now be seen that one aspect of the invention is a method of making a reactive multilayer foil composed of a plurality of alternating layers that can react exothermically. The method comprises the steps of providing a substrate, vapor depositing the alternating layers on the substrate to form the multilayer foil, and separating the multilayer foil from the substrate. Advantageously the substrate has sufficient adherence to the deposited layers to retain the layers during deposition but insufficient adherence to prevent removal of the multilayer foil after deposition. As an example, the layers can comprise one or more layers of aluminum deposited in contact with a silicon substrate. Alternatively, the substrate can include a coating of release material or an adhesion material to achieve the proper level of adherence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> One approach for separating the multilayer foil from the substrate is to provide a substrate with a sacrificial layer (or make the entire substrate a sacrificial layer) that can be etched or peeled away from the foil after deposition. Exemplary materials for a sacrificial layer include copper, brass and photoresist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The vapor depositing of the layers is preferably by physical vapor deposition such as by magnetron sputtering or electron beam evaporation. Advantageously the substrate is cooled during the vapor depositing to reduce intermixing of the alternating layers, to reduce energy losses and to reduce stresses in the deposited layers. Advantageously the layers are deposited to form a multilayer foil having a thickness in the range 50 &mgr;m -1 cm. Foils thus made with a thickness in the range 10 &mgr;m to 1 cm can be used as freestanding foils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is a method of bonding a first body to a second body comprising the steps of providing a freestanding reactive multilayer foil, pressing the bodies together against the foil and igniting the reactive foil. The ignited foil can melt material of the bodies or melt an associated meltable (joining material) layer to join the bodies together. Alternatively, the reaction product of the layers can itself be the joining material. One or both of the bodies can be semiconductor or microelectronic devices. The method is particularly advantageous for joining bodies having coefficients of thermal expansion, which differ by 1 &mgr;m/m/&deg; C. or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, a reactive multilayer foil includes a plurality of openings through the thickness of the foil. The openings are preferably periodic over the foil area. These openings can be left unfilled or they can be filled with meltable materials, propellants, or other materials that will change or react on heating when the reactive foil is ignited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Such apertured foils can be made by providing a substrate having a surface including a plurality of preformed openings, bumps or particles of thickness (or depth) comparable to or larger than the thickness of the multilayer foil to be deposited, depositing the reactive multilayer foil, and separating the resulting apertured multilayer foil from the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a reactive multilayer foil can be deposited on a substrate, patterned by a removable masking layer, and etched to form a plurality of holes. The apertured foil can then be removed from the substrate. Yet further in the alternative, a continuous foil can be formed and holes can be formed in the continuous foil by mechanical pressing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The apertured foils have an important application in bonding. A reactive foil perforated by a plurality of openings is disposed between a first and a second body. If the body material is not meltable by the foil, a separate meltable layer or coating of meltable joining material is also disposed between the bodies. The bodies are pressed together against the foil (and joining material) and the foil is ignited to melt joining material. The melted material flows within and through the openings in the foil to join the bodies. This approach produces a characteristic joint with ductility enhancing bridges through the openings. It is especially advantageous where one or both bodies are semiconductor or microelectronic devices or where the devices have CTEs that differ by more than 1 &mgr;m/m/&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A third type of novel reactive foil is a composite reactive multilayer foil in which the individual layers in the foil differ in thickness or in composition, on moving across the total thickness of the foil, to achieve advantageous results. One exemplary composite reactive multilayer foil comprises a first section with a plurality of relatively thick reactive layers, e.g. 1 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m, stacked on a second section with a plurality of thinner reactive layers(e.g. 1-1000 nm). The section with the thinner reactive layers ignites more rapidly than would the section with the thicker reactive layers. But as ignition spreads across the thinner section, it ignites the thicker section to produce a more uniform ignition and higher heat. Similar results can be achieved by variation of the foil composition in the thickness direction. Compositional variations can provide one set of layers whose reaction product provides joining material and another set of more reactive layers for igniting the first set. Compositional variations can be achieved, for example, by varying the process parameters in vapor depositing in accordance with techniques well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A fourth type of novel reactive foil has a major surface area composed of at least two different regions: one or more first regions which will react to form electrically conductive material and one or more second regions which are non-conductive. Such foils are particularly useful in connecting semiconductor device electrical contacts to a substrate having receiving contacts. A foil can be disposed between the device and the substrate with the device contacts, the contacts of the substrate and the first regions of the foil all in registration. The device and substrate are then pressed against the foil, and the foil is ignited to bond the device to the substrate with the respective contacts conductively connected and the other regions non-conductively bonded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated, it should be apparent that many modifications to the embodiments and implementations of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. While the illustrated embodiments have been described generically referring to the joining of bulk materials, it should be readily apparent that any materials that are to be coupled (permanently or temporarily) together through soldering, brazing, welding or other known technique can be coupled together utilizing the invention. Materials such as metallic glasses (e.g., amorphous glass), metals (e.g., Cu) and alloys (e.g., stainless steel), polymers, ceramics (e.g. SiC), composites, semiconductors, and numerous others in various combinations. The scope made available as a direct result of the advantages derived by joining materials utilizing the invention range from large scale bonding of SiC armor to Ti&mdash;Al&mdash;V tank bodies, or the bonding of carbide coatings to tool bits, to microscopic bonding of microchips to circuit boards on a nano or microscale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The stimulus used to initiate the self-sustaining reaction in the reactive foils of the preferred embodiments may be any form of energy such as the impact from a sharp stylus, spark from an electrical source, heat from a filament, radiation from a laser, etc. Although the illustrated embodiments have been described as applied in an environment of air at room temperature, it should be readily apparent that the invention may be practiced in other environments including vacuum, argon, water, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> It should be readily apparent that the quantitative data (e.g., reaction velocity, peak temperature, heating rate, etc.) of particular embodiments may easily be modified by varying elements of the reaction (e.g., varying composition of materials A or B, thickness of layers, total thickness of foil, or braze layer composition/thickness). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Although the embodiments specifically illustrated herein depict joining materials in the form of two sheets forming a sandwich around a reactive foil (as shown, for example, by sheets <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>), it should be apparent that any number of sheets (or other structures) of joining materials may be used, including a single layer wrapped around reactive foil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or joining materials attached to the bulk components. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, no layer of joining material at all may also be used. For example, metallic glass bulk material, metallic glass reactive foils, or both may be used in joining applications without the use of joining material (e.g., braze). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Moreover, although the illustrated embodiments have only utilized two different materials A/B as alternating layers in a reactive foil, it should be apparent that any number of material layers can be utilized to form a reactive foil in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In addition, many of the preferred embodiments disclosed herein (e.g., patterning foils, perforations in the foil, etc.) make particular use of freestanding foils, it should be readily apparent, however, that these embodiments and other aspects of the invention may be implemented without use of freestanding foils. Furthermore, it should be readily apparent that the intentionally designed openings in the reactive foil surface may penetrate through any number of layers in the foil, although it is preferred that the entire foil structure be penetrated as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The openings, while depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as circle-shaped holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, may be any single (or combination) of shapes forming one or more patterned structures on the reactive foil. The openings may be formed vertically in the direction normal to the layers of the reactive foil, or be formed at one or more angles through the layers of the foil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Thus numerous and varied other arrangements can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides new high resolution resists applicable to next generation lithographies, methods of making these novel resists, and new lithographic processes using these resists to effect state-of-the-art lithographies.

This invention and the disclosed embodiments constitute fundamentally new architectures for high resolution resists. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Within the next decade the microelectronic industry will require a lithographic process capable of mass-producing integrated circuits with sub-70 nanometer (nm) critical dimensions (see: L. R. Harriott, <highlight><italic>Materials Today </italic></highlight>2, 9 (1999)). This formidable challenge is unlikely to be achieved by evolutionary steps. Extreme UV (EUVL), X-ray (XRL), electron beam (EBL) and ion beam (IBL) lithographies therefore have emerged as more promising candidates for next generation nanofabrication than standard photolithographies, because the shorter the radiation wavelength employed in the lithographic process, the finer the theoretical resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order to fully exploit these next generation, sub-100 nm lithographic exposure tools, it is essential to develop compatible, next generation resists&mdash;i.e. imaging or recording media&mdash;that are capable of accommodating the higher resolutions these new exposure tools provide. Such a resist material would need to achieve high sensitivity, high contrast, high resolution and high plasma etch resistance for pattern transfer to a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A principal example of the disparity between state-of-the-art exposure tools and presently available recording media is seen in electron beam lithography. Although instrumentation for electron beam exposure is capable of sub-100 nm resolution, current resists for recording these exposure patterns suffer from electron proximity effects, which result in resist degradation well beyond the area of actual exposure. Accordingly, this invention provides not only new resists for electron beam lithography, but also new resists adaptable to many short wavelength lithographic methods for higher-resolution, next generation nanofabrication. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses many of the current limitations in next generation lithographic techniques by providing new resists that achieve high sensitivity, high contrast, high resolution and high plasma etch resistance for pattern transfer to a substrate. These goals are achieved through a variety of new resist architectures that incorporate new functional components into resist polymer matrices in novel ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Of all the lithographic technologies for sub-100 nm patterning, electron beam lithography (EBL) is considered the paradigm for next generation lithography, as it is perhaps the most versatile technique benefiting from research and development knowledge accumulated over the past several decades. However, unlike ion beam lithography, EBL suffers from a serious intrinsic problem, namely electron proximity effects which stem from polymer/electron interactions at the molecular level. These effects arise from secondary electrons that induce severe degradation of the pattern definition, as the uniform exposure of the resist by the incident electron beam gives rise to a non-uniform distribution of actual exposure in the pattern writing area. During the past two decades, attempts have been made to decrease the electron proximity effects (see, for example: A. N. Broers, <highlight><italic>IBM J Res. Develop. </italic></highlight>32, 502 (1988)) but no significant breakthrough has been achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A similar intrinsic problem arises using extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), viz. the generation of photoelectrons in the polymeric resist. These photoelectrons, like the secondary electrons in electron beam resists, induce resolution degradation due to the off-axis pathways of photoelectrons. What is needed is an alternative approach to resist materials that can drastically reduce the electron proximity effects without requiring the modification of current EBL or EUVL exposure machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Projection optical lithography at 157 nm (&ldquo;157 nm lithography&rdquo;) also requires a fundamental examination of resist compatability with the excimer laser radiation utilized by this method. What is needed is a way to improve the etch resistance, high temperature stability, pattern collapse and line-edge roughness in resists that are compatible with this method, while maintaining the optical transparency that is required at this wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Two primary types of resist polymers that have been investigated in recent years are the chain-scission resists designed for EBL, and the chemically amplified (CA) resists designed for both EBL and photolithographies. Upon irradiation of a chain-scission resist film with an electron beam, the molecular weights of the polymers in the exposed regions are decreased via chain scission reactions arising from the irradiation. As a result, solubility differentiation is achieved between the exposed and the unexposed regions. The CA resists achieve solubility differentiation based on an acid-catalyzed deprotection reaction which changes the polarity of the polymer in the exposed region. A typical CA resist formula consists of a matrix polymer and a photoacid generator (PAG). Upon irradiation with an electron beam or extreme UV radiation, the PAG generates a strong acid that catalyzes the deprotection reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Several classes of PAGs have been used in CA resists, including ionic PAGs such as sulfonium and ionium salts, as well as nonionic PAGs. However these PAGs are almost exclusively used in their monomeric forms, and small molecule PAGs typically exhibit limited compatibility with the resist polymer matrix. As a result, problems such as phase separation, non-uniform acid distribution, and non-uniform acid migration occurring during temperature fluctuations (e.g. variation in baking processing) may arise. Such limitations frequently lead to an undesirable, premature and non-uniform deprotection reaction in the CA resist film. It would be desirable to develop a fundamentally new way of adding PAGs into a resist polymer to alleviate these problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Typically, both the chain-scission resists and the chemically amplified (CA) resists are polymeric organic materials. While it is generally believed that CA resist concept offers the best strategy for advancements in resist technology in optical lithography, EBL and XRL, pure organic resists have generally posed certain deficiencies. For example, etch resistance, high temperature stability, pattern collapse, line-edge roughness, and other problems can limit the applicability of organic resists. Some resist technologies have relied upon inorganic materials to address these limitations. For example, inorganic resists such as silica and metal halides are generally not subject to the secondary electron degradation effects. However, patterning at high doses and the difficulty in inorganic resist coating have hampered their applications. Additionally, while it has been demonstrated that inorganic resists are capable of exhibiting a higher contrast than standard organic resists, their intrinsic lower sensitivity and complex deposition methods make them more suitable for ion beam lithography than for electron beam lithography. It would be advantageous to develop new resists that combined, to the extent possible, the most desirable properties of organic resists with those of the inorganic resists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One of the more successful CA resists developed in recent years has been a chemically amplified (CA) resist using tert-butyl methacrylate (TBMA) as deblocking component. (See, for example: G. M. Wallraff and W. D. Hinsberg, <highlight><italic>Chem. Rev. </italic></highlight>99, 1801 (1999).) This methacrylate-based resist, designed for photolithography, has high resolution and sensitivity, however it lacks the plasma etch resistance required for subsequent pattern transfer to the substrate. What is needed is a way to incorporate the advantages of those inorganic systems into methacrylate-based CA resist systems, in order to improve the plasma etch resistance of the resist for enhancing its utility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Although the CA resist concept may offer the best strategy for future advancements in resist technology in certain types of lithography, the very nature of an acid-catalyzed deprotection pathway gives rise to inherent problems such as acid diffusion and post-exposure instability. To address these problems, it would be desirable to design and develop resists that are directly sensitive to radiation without utilizing the concept of chemical amplification. Such a resist would desirably achieve the high sensitivity necessary to meet the requirements for high throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it has become imperative to address these current limitations in lithography by providing new resists that afford the high sensitivity, high contrast, high resolution and high plasma etch resistance. These resists would also seek to take full advantage of the next generations lithographic irradiation sources, including EBL and EUVL, by reducing the electron proximity effects without requiring the modification of current EBL or EUVL exposure machines. Some of the desired resists would, to the extent possible, combine the advantages and most desirable properties of organic resists with those of inorganic resists. In addition, next generation methacrylate-based CA resist systems would seek fundamentally new architectures that afforded enhanced plasma etch resistance and improved pattern transfer to the substrate. New CA resists need to be engineered to provide novel ways to incorporate and extend the compatibility of small molecule PAGs with the resist polymer matrix. Moreover, next generation resists that are directly sensitive to radiation without utilizing the concept of chemical amplification would be sought. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides these novel alternative approaches to high resolution resists applicable to next generation lithographies. In one embodiment, an nanoparticle modified ZEP520&reg; nanocomposite resist has been designed and engineered to drastically reduce the electron proximity effects without modifying current electron beam lithography machines. By incorporating a nanoparticle&mdash;particularly nanoparticle-size inorganic materials (e.g. SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or inorganic molecular clusters (e.g. Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>)&mdash;into a nanocomposite, the reactive ion etch (RIE) resistance of these new resists is also improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> This invention also provides new ways to impart greater plasma stability to CA resists, including fundamentally new ways to synergistically combine organic and inorganic resist designs. In one embodiment, methacrylate-based CA resists that incorporate inorganic clusters of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) into the side chains are provided. By making the inorganic cluster a component of the polymer, properties such as RIE resistance, pattern stability, and temperature stability of the resists are improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention also affords fundamentally new ways to enhance the compatibility of PAGs with the resist polymer matrix. In one embodiment, new resist samples are prepared by co-polymerization of a PAG component with various methacrylate compounds, even at high PAG loading levels. This new resist architecture makes the PAG moiety an actual modular unit within the resist polymer, thereby directly addressing the limited compatibility of monomeric PAGs with the resist polymer matrix. By doing so, problems of phase separation and non-uniform acid distribution frequently observed for CA resists containing a high percentage of monomeric PAGs are substantially eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention provides new resist materials that, while highly sensitive to UV radiation, function as non-chemically amplified resists. This resist design is accomplished by providing homopolymers that are prepared from PAG compounds, and does not require co-polymerization with CA resists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention also addresses one of the fundamental problems of projection optical lithography at 157 nm, namely improving the etch resistance and pattern stability in a suitable resist, while maintaining the optical transparency required at this wavelength. This goal is accomplished by incorporating inorganic clusters of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxanes (POSS) into the polyacetal polymers, using components with substituents and side chains that are transparent at this wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is to provide new resists with increased resolution and improved pattern definition over currently available resist materials such as pure poly(&agr;-chloroacrylate-co-&agr;-methyl styrene) (ZEP520&reg;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of this invention is to reduce the proximity effects and thereby provide better resolution in electron beam lithography, extreme ultraviolet lithography, etc., over that currently available using resist materials such as pure ZEP520&reg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> One additional aspect of the present invention is to provide a nanocomposite resist comprising a nanoparticle component, especially an inorganic nanoparticle component (e.g. a metal oxide or metal oxide-containing nanoparticle), and a polymer component, methods of making such a resist, and methods of using this resist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the present invention is to design new resists with improved reactive ion etch (RIE) resistance, without sacrificing resist sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of this invention is the development of novel CA resists that incorporate photoacid generating groups (PAGs) at high loading/high concentration, but do not suffer from the phase separation, non-uniform acid distribution, and non-uniform acid migration problems common among standard CA resists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An additional aspect of this invention is to provide polymeric chemically amplified resists comprising a methacrylate component, a polyhedral oligosilsequioxane component, and a photoacid generating component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the present invention is to afford polymeric chemically amplified resists comprising a methacrylate component and a polyhedral oligosilsequioxane component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of this invention is to combine organic and inorganic resist designs by incorporating inorganic clusters, especially polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) moieties, into the side chains of methacrylate-based CA resists. Therefore, the present invention addresses the lack of reactive ion etch (RIE) resistance in methacrylate-based CA resists, that is necessary for pattern transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> An additional aspect of the present invention is to afford photopolymers that can act as high performance resists without employing chemical amplification, and thereby are free from the inherent problems associated with chemically amplified resists. Another aspect of the invention is providing a polymeric resist comprising a photoacid generating component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of this invention is providing new resists for projection optical lithography at 157 nm (&ldquo;157 nm lithography&rdquo;) that combine the most useful properties of organic and inorganic resists by incorporating POSS (polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane) inorganic clusters into polyacetal linkages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Further aspects of this invention include providing new lithographic processes utilizing the novel resists of the present invention, as well as providing integrated circuits prepared by these new lithographic process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> These and other features, aspects, objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent after a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed embodiments.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides new high resolution resists applicable to next generation lithographies, methods of making these novel resists, and methods of using these resists to effect state-of-the-art lithographies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In order to more clearly define the terms used herein, the following definitions are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A resist, as used herein, refers to the imaging or recording medium, usually a polymeric material, that is used in a lithographic process, typically for the production of integrated circuits. In a general sense, a resist is a material that is used to prevent a particular chemical or physical reaction such as chemical attack, electrodeposition, vapor phase deposition, or other reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Lithography, or a lithographic process, as used herein, refers to a process by which the pattern, typically a pattern of an integrated circuit, is imprinted onto a substrate or a resist. Lithography may be accomplished by exposing a recording medium with radiation of some form, followed by developing the pattern to be used, which results in the removal of either the exposed or the unexposed material. A variety of radiation sources may be used, including but not limited to, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) or deep ultraviolet (DUV) radiation, X-rays, electron beams, and ion beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A nanocomposite, as used herein, refers to a combination of two or more phases containing different compositions or structures, wherein at least one of these phases is in the nanoscale regime (1-100 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A metal oxide nanoparticle, as used herein, refers to nanometer-sized particles containing oxygen and at least one metal. This definition includes particles of a metal oxide such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(silica) or Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(alumina) that are nanometer scale (typically 1-100 nm), but also includes discrete molecular clusters that containing oxygen and at least one metal, such as polyhedral oligosilsesquioxanes (POSS). Examples of POSS clusters include, but are not limited to, the series of cubic clusters of the general formula Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(OR)<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>or Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>where R&equals;alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, silyl, substituted silyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, substituted aralkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl. Other examples of POSS clusters are the polyhedral clusters of the type Si<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>(OR)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, or Si<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>. where R&equals;alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, silyl, substituted silyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, substituted aralkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl. Whether referring to a metal oxide particle, or a discrete molecular cluster, all of these materials will be described as &ldquo;metal oxide&rdquo; nanoparticles. Specifically, &ldquo;silica nanoparticles&rdquo; will be used herein to describe both nanoscale SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and nanoscale clusters of the general formula Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(OR)<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, Si<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>(OR)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, or Si<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A mixed oxide, as used herein, describes a single chemical phase in which more than one metal is combined with oxygen to form a single chemical compound. For example, BaTiO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and YMnO3 represents mixed oxides which are different from mixtures of two oxide compounds, of which an In<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mixture is an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A nanoparticle, as used herein, refers to nanometer-sized particles that contain at least one metal or non-metal element as a component. For example, this definition includes, but is not limited to, particles of borides, carbides, silicides, nitrides, phosphides, arsenides, oxides, sulfides, selenides, tellurides, halides (fluorides, chlorides, bromides, or iodides), and combinations thereof. This term also encompasses more complex inorganic species such as a single chemical phase in which more than one metal is combined with an element (e.g. a bimetallic sulfide), a single chemical phase in a metal is combined with more than one other element (e.g. a metal oxycarbide), derivatives thereof, and combinations thereof in nanoparticle form. Therefore, this definition includes particles of inorganic materials such as FeS, NiAs or MnSe that are nanometer scale, but also includes discrete inorganic molecular clusters, e.g. Na<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Nb<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>, W<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, salts of &lsqb;Mo<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>26</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><superscript>4&minus;</superscript></highlight>, or the vast range of heteropolyanion-containing compounds of the transition metals. Organometallic nanoparticles such as Re<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Me<highlight><subscript>9 </subscript></highlight>and Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>are also encompassed by this term. Thus, the term &ldquo;nanoparticle&rdquo; includes the materials described above by the term &ldquo;metal oxide nanoparticle&rdquo;, but is not limited to oxygen-containing materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Novel Nanocomposite Resists Incorporating Nanoparticles </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Nanocomposite resists have previously been reported for performance improvements in etch resistance, thermal resistance and mechanical stability. For example, Ishii demonstrated that a C<highlight><subscript>60 </subscript></highlight>incorporated ZEP520&reg; nanocomposite resist could significantly improve the mechanical property of pure ZEP520&reg; resist. (See: T. Ishii, H. Nozawa, T. Tamamura, and A. Ozawa, <highlight><italic>J. Vac. Sci. Technol B </italic></highlight>15, 2570 (1997).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> For electron beam lithography, a more challenging issue is the proximity effect, which fundamentally stems from the molecular level interactions of electrons with polymers. These interactions induce severe degradation of the pattern definition, as the uniform exposure of the resist by the incident electron beam gives rise to a non-uniform distribution of actual exposure in the pattern writing area. The present invention provides a nanoparticle-modified nanocomposite resist. The nanoparticles, which include inorganic materials such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or FeS that are nanometer scale, as well as discrete inorganic molecular clusters, such as Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(OSiMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>or Na<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Nb<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>, are incorporated into a polymer matrix to form the nanocomposite resist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> One feature of the present invention is a metal oxide nanoparticle-modified nanocomposite resist. These nanocomposite resists incorporate nanoparticles of a metal oxide such as SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(silica) and/or discrete molecular clusters such as polyhedral oligosilsesquioxanes (POSS), in a polymer matrix. Example 1 describes the preparative method for one embodiment of this nanocomposite resist employing silica nanoparticles Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(OSiMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>(Tal Materials, Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.) in a ZEP520&reg; (poly(&agr;-chloroacrylate-co-&agr;-methyl styrene, Zeon Chemicals L.P., Louisville, Ky.) polymer matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> One feature of the POSS silica nanoparticles is the surface-functionalization of the silicon oxide core with alkyl, cycloalkyl, silyl, aryl, aralkyl, or alkenyl groups. Thus, the POSS silica nanoparticles Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>may be surface functionalized with hydrophobic surface groups such as isooctyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl, isobutyl, methyl or phenyl (Hybrid Plastics, Fountain Valley, Calif.), for blending with a ZEP520&reg; copolymer (poly(&agr;-chloroacrylate-co-&agr;-methyl styrene). Similarly, silica nanoparticles that are surface functionalized with hydrophilic groups, such as Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(OSiMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>OH)<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>, Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(O<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>NMe<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>.60H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, or Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>may be utilized with appropriate hydrophilic polymer matrices. Incorporating mixtures of nanoparticles in a polymer or copolymer matrix is also envisioned in this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that nanoparticles of various metal oxides are also encompassed by this invention, including but not limited to, oxides of silicon, aluminum, titanium, zirconium, iron, antimony, tin, cerium, barium, manganese, vanadium, chromium, lead, copper, indium, yttrium, zinc, mixed oxides thereof, and combinations of oxides thereof. It is also to be understood that other non-oxide nanoparticles are further encompassed by this invention, including but not limited to, borides, carbides, suicides, nitrides, phosphides, arsenides, sulfides, selenides, tellurides, fluorides, chlorides, bromides, iodides, and combinations thereof. Nanoparticles of less than about 100 nanometers (nm) are encompassed by the present invention, but nanoparticles of less than about 10 nm are preferred, nanoparticles of less than about 2 nm are more preferred. Additionally, various polymer matrices are encompassed by this invention, including, but not limited to, poly(&agr;-chloroacrylate-co-&agr;-methyl styrene), poly(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl-&agr;-chloroacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(butene sulfone), polysilanes, polyacetals or combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> One of the purposes of incorporating nanoparticles into resists was to increase their reactive ion etch (RIE) resistance. Example 2 and Table 1 provide details of the plasma etching rate of a silica nanoparticle-modified ZEP520&reg; at different loadings. Nanocomposites with up to about 50% nanoparticle by weight are encompassed by the present invention, and test data for about 4%, 7%, and 15% by weight of Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(OSiMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>nanoparticles in ZEP520&reg; are shown in Table 1. As indicated in Table 1, compared with pure ZEP520&reg;, incorporation of Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(OSiMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>nanoparticles did not increase the etching resistance with CF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. However, replacing CF<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>with O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>marginally increased the etching resistance at low loading of silica particles in ZEP520&reg; (about 4 wt %), but at a higher loading the resistance enhancement was significant. The etching rate decreased from 2000 &angst;/min for ZEP520&reg; to about 100 &angst;/min for 7 wt % Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(OSiMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>loaded ZEP520&reg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Another function of nanoparticles was aimed at reducing the proximity effect. While not intending to be bound by the following statement, it is postulated that the presence of silica nanoparticles in the polymer not only statistically reduces the lateral range of the incident electrons, but also reduces the lateral energy spread of the secondary electrons due to a &ldquo;blocking&rdquo; effect of silica nanoparticles. This postulation is based on the fact that the silica nanoparticles have a higher average atomic number Z than the organic polymer components and therefore, a higher electron stopping power. The combined effects appear to result in a reduction of the proximity effects in the nanocomposite resist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to examine the compatibility between silica nanoparticles and ZEP520&reg;, as described in Example 3. The DSC results are interpreted based on the assumption that nanoparticles that have strong interactions with the polymer will impart a higher glass transition temperature (T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>) to the composite as compared to the pure polymer, as particles can be treated as a crosslinking agent. Otherwise the composite will show a lower T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>as the particles behave as a plasticizer. These DSC experiments indicated that the addition of silica nanoparticles to ZEP520&reg; increased the glass transition temperature of ZEP520&reg; to around 160-170&deg; C. in the composites. However for loadings higher than about 4 wt %, the increase of T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>levelled off, implying that about 4 wt % loading of silica nanoparticles in ZEP520&reg; corresponded to the saturation concentration. When the loading was higher than about 4 wt %, the silica nanoparticles tended to aggregate and under optical microscopy a phase separation was observed. Thus, the compatibility between nanoparticle and polymer at about 4 wt % of silica nanoparticles is an important factor in minimizing line broadening during electron-beam lithography, as indicated by the line edge roughness which was observed when phase separation occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> One concern regarding silica nanoparticle incorporation is that they would decrease the sensitivity of the host resist, such as ZEP520.&reg; To investigate this possibility, normalized residual thickness (NRT) curves were measured for both silica incorporated ZEP520&reg; and pure ZEP520&reg; under the identical conditions at 20 keV. This study indicated that incorporation of silica nanoparticles had no significant effect on ZEP520&reg; in terms of sensitivity and contrast. The results of these experiments are presented in Example 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Example 5 provides a preliminary assessment of the lithographic performance of the nanocomposite resist, where isolated lines were patterned at 20 keV. It was found that writing lines with the objective of obtaining 60 nm and 40 nm widths in an ca. 400 nm thick nanocomposite film with about 4 wt % silica nanoparticle loading, the actual line widths were 69 nm and 47 nm, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The compatibility between nanoparticles and ZEP520&reg; in the nanocomposite is an important factor in minimizing line broadening during electron-beam lithography, as indicated by the line edge roughness which was observed when phase separation occurred. Phase separation occurred, as indicated by line edge roughness, in nanocomposite samples of ZEP520&reg; containing 7 wt % silica nanoparticles, by optical microscopy, whereas no phase separation occurred in those nanocomposites with 4 wt % of silica nanoparticles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It appeared that a 20 keV electron beam did not have sufficient energy to penetrate through 350 nm films for the silica nanoparticle-incorporated ZEP520&reg;, indicated by shallow trenches, therefore higher voltage electron beams, 50 and 100 keV, were studied for both samples. Film thickness was 280 nm for the nanoparticle-incorporated ZEP520&reg;. Clear cross sectional images were obtained at 150 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>at 50 keV and 210 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>at 100 keV. The pattern designed for the exposure at 50 keV and 100 keV had a fixed line width of 60 nm with various line spaces of 6 w (6 times the line width), 5 w, 4 w, 3 w, 2 w, 1 w and &frac12; w. The results of these experiments are presented in Example 6 and indicated that greater pattern stability and close line spacings were easily obtainable in the silica nanoparticle/ZEP520&reg; nanocomposite. For example, at 210 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>with an electron beam energy of 100 keV, the pattern on silica nanoparticle/ZEP520&reg; nanocomposite gave trenches with a actual width of about 67 nm even when the spacing was as low as 1 w, or 60 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Incorporation of Polyhedral Oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) into Chemically Amplified (CA) Resists </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses one of the fundamental drawbacks of methacrylate-based CA resists, namely their lack of reactive ion etch (RIE) resistance necessary for pattern transfer, by providing a fundamentally new way to synergistically combine organic and inorganic resist designs. In one embodiment, this invention provides methacrylate-based CA resists that incorporate inorganic clusters of polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) into the polymer side chains. Thus, the present invention encompasses a polymeric chemically amplified resist comprising a methacrylate component and a polyhedral oligosilsequioxane component. The methacrylate component is typically a combination of more than one methacrylate compound, and typically is selected from methyl methacrylate, t-butyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid, or combinations thereof, although other methacrylate compounds are included in the present invention. The polyhedral oligosilsequioxane component is typically selected from 3-(3,5,7,9,11,13,15-heptacyclopentylpentacyclo-&lsqb;9.5.1.1<highlight><superscript>3,9</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>5,15</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>7,13</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;octasiloxane-1-yl)propyl methacrylate; 3-&lsqb;(3,5,7,9,11,13,15-heptacyclopentylpentacyclo-&lsqb;9.5.1.1<highlight><superscript>3,9</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>5,15</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>7,13</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;-octasiloxan-1-yloxy)dimethylsilyl&rsqb;propyl methacrylate; 1,3,5,7,9,11,13-heptacyclopentyl -15vinylpentacyclo-&lsqb;9.5.1.1<highlight><superscript>3,9</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>5,15</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>7,13</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;octasiloxane, or combinations thereof. However, other silica cage compounds that contain polymerizable groups are encompassed by the present invention, as are various other inorganic clusters containing polymerizable groups. For example, there are a number of iron, cobalt, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten, platinum, palladium, boron, tin, ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, rhenium, niobium, and tantalum clusters with pendant polymerizable groups that are encompassed by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> An illustration or schematic of the microstructure of one embodiment, a copolymer containing methyl methacrylate (MMA), t-butyl methacrylate (TBMA), methacrylic acid (MAA), and the polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane, 3-(3,5,7,9,11,13,15-heptacyclopentylpentacyclo-&lsqb;9.5.1.1<highlight><superscript>3,9</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>5,15</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>7,13</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;octasiloxane-1-yl)propyl methacrylate (propyl methacrylate POSS), is presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. While not wanting to be bound by this statement, it is believed that because this MMA/TBMA/MAA/POSS copolymer incorporates an inorganic moiety, here the POSS moiety with a cluster or cage-like structure, is more etch resistant than organic units without such a moiety. In addition, the silica cage of the POSS unit is surrounded by bulky cyclopentyl groups in this particular propyl methacrylate POSS, which could afford POSS even higher etch resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> General details of the preparation of a methacrylate-based CA resist incorporating a polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane (POSS) component are presented in Example 7, and Example 8 describes the characterization of these methacrylate-based CA resists. Table 2 presents the relative weight percents of components loaded into the mixture to be polymerized, and the percent composition of that component in the resulting polymer, for four representative resist samples with various POSS content. Table 2 also presents the glass transition temperatures (Tg), weight-average molecular weights (M<highlight><subscript>w</subscript></highlight>), and polydispersity indices (PDI) of each representative polymer sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the POSS component is incorporated into the CA resist of the present invention from about 1% to about 40% by weight in the polymer, although a POSS content of from about 10% to about 35% by weight in the polymer is preferable. Polymers prepared according to this invention are typically characterized by a glass transition temperature greater than about 165&deg; C. and a weight-average molecular weights (Mw) greater than about 100,000 g/mol, although those polymers outside these ranges are encompassed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> One primary purpose of incorporating POSS units into the polymer matrix is to increase their reactive ion etch (RIE) resistance, and Example 9 and Table 3 record the polymer etch data for all four representative samples presented in Table 2. As these results indicate, all four samples exhibited a similar etch resistance regardless of their varied POSS contents, in the CF<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>plasma tests. One possible explanation for this observation is that the POSS silica cage is not resistant to the CF<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>plasma, as suggested by the fact that the Si&mdash;F bond is an extremely stable single bond. On the other hand, the POSS unit content is observed to affect the polymers&apos; etch resistance in the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma. When the POSS content is 12.5 wt %, no RIE enhancement is observed. When this content increases to 22.5 wt %, a significant improvement is observed. Further increase in the POSS units to 30.5 wt % gives a etch rate nearly one-third (&frac13;) of that measured for the sample containing no POSS units that was used as a reference for the RIE comparison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> An examination of these samples by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) indicated morphology differences in those resists that contained the POSS moieties at different weight percents. While not wanting to be bound by the following statement, it is believed that the morphologies observed by HRTEM are responsible for the different plasma etch behavior of the POSS-containing polymers. Thus, the POSS units in the low-concentration POSS samples appeared to associate to create discrete crystallites with small domain dimensions that would be inefficient to plasma erosion. As the POSS contents increased, the POSS units in the polymer assume a different morphology. In this case, a network of large, rectangular crystallites formed and uniformly distributed within the polymer matrix by association of the silica cages of the POSS units. This network of crystallites is believed to afford efficient protection against the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> While not wanting to be bound by the following statement, it is believed that the effectiveness of the POSS units in improving the RIE resistance in the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma lies in the intrinsic structure of the POSS units, that includes a silica cage and seven cyclopentyl groups around the cage corners. It is well accepted that inorganic molecules generally have higher resistance than organic molecules, and when combined with the steric bulk of the cyclopentyl groups, improved RIE resistance in the O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The lithographic properties of the POSS-containing samples were also evaluated under UV irradiation at a wavelength of 248 nm, and electron beam irradiation at 20 KeV, in which thin resist films were spin cast onto silicon wafers from PGME solutions. It was observed by exposure experiments that incorporation of this largely inorganic POSS component has not decreased the sensitivity of the resists under electron beam lithography. The imaging experiments are outlined in Example 10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Finally, it is noted that other POSS components could be incorporated into the methacrylate-based CA resist according to the method of Example 7, as indicated in Example 11. For example, additional POSS components that could be used include, but are not limited to 3-&lsqb;(3,5,7,9,11,13,15-heptacyclopentyl-pentacyclo-&lsqb;9.5.1.1<highlight><superscript>3,9</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>5,15</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>7,13</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;-octasiloxan-1-yloxy)dimethylsilyl&rsqb;propyl methacrylate (abbreviated dimethylsilyloxy-(propyl)methacrylate-POSS) and 1,3,5,7,9,11,13-heptacyclopentyl-15vinylpentacyclo-&lsqb;9.5.1.1<highlight><superscript>3,9</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>5,15</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>7,13</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;-octasiloxane (abbreviated vinyl-POSS). In addition, structurally similar POSS compounds, in which the silicon atoms at the corners of the POSS cage are substituted with R groups other than cyclopentyl, could be used in the preparation of methacrylate-based CA resists according to the present invention. Thus, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, POSS components could be used wherein R is selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, heteroalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, substituted derivatives thereof, combinations thereof, or similar substituents. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> To alleviate the problems associated with simply adding monomeric photoacid generating groups (PAGs) into CA resist films outlined above, the present invention incorporates photoacid generating units directly into the polymeric resist chains as part of the polymeric unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> For these CA resists, tert-butyl methacrylate (TBMA) was used as a protection group, although similarly operable protecting groups could be used. Polyhedral oligosilsequioxane methacrylate (POSS) components were incorporated in some samples to achieve higher plasma etch rate required for pattern transfer, however it is to be understood that it is not necessary to incorporate POSS components in this embodiment of the present invention. In addition, silica nanoparticles can be blended in for enhanced etch resistance to provide another embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A PAG monomer containing a photosensitive sulfonium unit coupled with a vinyl (methacrylate) polymerizable group, viz. &lsqb;p-CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&boxH;C(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)C(O)OC<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>SMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;OSO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, was synthesized according to Example 12, and shown in the reaction scheme below. The vinyl (methacrylate) polymerizable group was selected to make the PAG monomer compatible with common methacrylate compounds found in CA resists. Resist samples were then prepared by co-polymerization of the PAG component with various methacrylate compounds as indicated in Example 13, with the components and corresponding compositions of representative samples listed in Table 4 and Example 14. The methacrylate component is typically a combination of more than one methacrylate compound, usually selected from methyl methacrylate, t-butyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid, or combinations thereof, although other methacrylate compounds are included herein. The photoacid generating component typically contains a sulfonium group, but other photoacid generating compounds, such as iodonium are encompassed by this invention.

When present, the polyhedral oligosilsequioxane component is typically selected from 3-(3,5,7,9,11,13,15-heptacyclopentylpentacyclo&lsqb;9.5.1.1<highlight><superscript>3,9</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>5,15</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>7,13</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;octasiloxane-1-yl)propyl methacrylate; 3-&lsqb;(3,5,7,9,11,13,15-heptacyclopentylpentacyclo-&lsqb;9.5.1.1<highlight><superscript>3,9</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>5,15</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>7,13</superscript></highlight>&rsqb;-octasiloxan-1-yloxy)dimethylsilyl&rsqb;propyl methacrylate; 1,3,5,7,9,11,13-heptacyclopentyl-15-vinylpentacyclo-&lsqb;9.5.1.1<highlight><superscript>3,9</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>5,15</superscript></highlight>.1<highlight><superscript>7,13</superscript></highlight>&rsqb; octasiloxane, or combinations thereof.

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When present in the chemically amplified resist, the polyhedral oligosilsequioxane component is present from about 1% to about 35% by weight in the polymer, preferably from about 10% to about 32% by weight in the polymer. Additionally, the photoacid generating component is present from about 2% to about 25% by weight in the polymer, preferably from about 5% to about 20% by weight in the polymer. Polymers prepared according to this invention are typically characterized by a weight-average molecular weights (Mw) varying from 20,000 to 100,000 g/mol and a polydispersity index between 1 and about 2, although those polymers outside these ranges are encompassed by the present invention. </paragraph>

All resists samples had excellent film formation behavior. No pinholes were observed even with a film thickness of below 100 nm. This observation behavior could be attributed to the absence of phase separation frequently observed for CA resists containing a high percentage of small-molecule PAGs that are not incorporated directly into the polymeric resist chains as part of the polymeric unit. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The resist films of this invention were first exposed on an EX7 DUV 248 nm Excimer Laser stepper at a wavelength of 248 nm. Typical processing conditions are presented in Example 15. High resolution SEM micrographs of patterns obtained for samples at a dose of 5 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>were compared for those samples that incorporated itaconic anhydride and those that did not. Itaconic anhydride (IA) functions as a dissolution promoter in TMAH solutions, and samples containing IA developed properly in either 0.21 or 0.26 N TMAH solutions. In contrast, samples that contained no IA dissolution promoter developed equally well in 0.26 N TMAH, most probably due to high conversion of tert-butyl group into an acid (&mdash;COOH) group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> All resist samples had a wide processing window in terms of post-exposure-bake (PEB) temperatures under both 248 nm deep UV and electron beam exposures. A series of PEB temperatures, viz. 110, 120, 125 and 130&deg; C. were applied, while maintaining the other processing parameters the same. The image quality obtained using different PEB temperatures was indistinguishable. Additionally, most samples were found to be relatively insensitive to TMAH concentrations. For example, different TMAH solution concentrations, from about 0.1 N to about 0.26 N, were equally effective for developing sample 13a in Table 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The resists were also found to be very sensitive to electron beam radiation. The imaging experiments were carried out on a Leo 982 SEM with a Nabity pattern generator at 20 keV. The processing conditions were almost identical to the photo-exposure at 248 nm. All samples exhibited very high sensitivity under both 248 nm deep-UV and 20 keV electron exposures. It is believed that the high sensitivity is attributable to the high loading of photoacid generator in the resists, which was made possible by incorporation of PAG units in the polymer chains. Without such incorporation directly into the polymer chains, phase separation would otherwise occur at high PAG loading levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Tailored Non-Chemically Amplified Resists </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> To address many of the inherent problems of chemically amplified resist technology, e.g. acid diffusion, post-exposure instability, etc., the present invention encompasses the design and development of resists that are directly sensitive to radiation without utilizing the concept of chemical amplification. These new resist materials, while highly sensitive to UV radiation, function as non-chemically amplified resists. This resist design is accomplished by homopolymers that are prepared from PAG components, and does not require co-polymerization with CA resists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In order for a polymer to be directly sensitive to radiation, a highly radiation-sensitive group must be introduced into the polymer units. Sulfonium salts have long been found to be sensitive to UV radiation and actually gained wide applications as photoacid generators (PAGs) in CA photoresists. For this reason, sulfonium groups were chosen as radiation-sensitive groups in the non-CA resists described herein. It has been discovered that homopolymers prepared from polymerizable PAG components are highly sensitive to UV radiation and act as non-chemically amplified (non-CA) resist materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The homo-polymerization reaction of the PAG component &lsqb;p-CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&boxH;C(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)C(O)OC<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>SMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;OSO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, initiated by AIBN (&agr;,&agr;&prime;-azobis(isobutyronitrile)), is described in Example 17, and polymer characterization is outlined in Example 18. Exposure at 248 nm was conducted to investigate the lithographic properties of this polymer, Example 19. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The rationale for this polymer to act as a resist was based upon a photochemical study carried out on the polymer. The unexposed polymer was polar, due to its ionic character, and therefore was soluble in polar solvents such as water. Upon exposure to 254 nm deep-UV radiation, the polymer underwent a polarity change, as evidenced by its change in solubility after irradiation. Thus, when irradiated, the sulfur-carbon bonds in the sulfonium groups were cleaved and a free acid was simultaneously generated. The irradiated polymer thereby lost its ionic character, became less polar, and was found to be insoluble in polar solvents. Unexposed portions of the resist film readily dissolved in an aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide developer while the exposed regions (patterns) were maintained after dipping the exposed resist film in developer. Thus, SEM micrographs of a negative-tone pattern obtained for this resist by exposure to 248 nm radiation at a dose of 50 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>revealed a feature dimension of approximately 250 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It was also found that this polymer was also very sensitive to electron beam radiation. Imaging experiments were run on a Leo 982 SEM with a Nabity pattern generator at 20 keV. The processing conditions were almost identical to the photo-exposure at 248 nm. Accordingly, SEM micrographs of negative-tone lines obtained for this resist at a dose of 25&deg; C./cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>provided line dimensions of approximately 200 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As a non-CA resist, this polymer was characterized with extremely high sensitivity. The doses obtained for this polymer were comparable to those obtained for CA resists, and therefore this polymer can meet the requirements for high throughput. It is speculated that the most probable reasons for its high sensitivity are as follows. It is well established that the degree of sensitivity of a radiation-sensitive compound usually depends on its environment. While the radiation-sensitive groups in such a compound can absorb energy directly from radiation, they usually obtain energy indirectly from a neighboring group by an energy transfer process. Unlike a small molecule compound, the resist reported here has a radiation-sensitive sulfonium groups which constitutes a side chain attached to a polymer backbone. Radiation most likely excites the polymer backbone and then transfers its energy to the sulfonium groups. Therefore, a relatively small amount of energy is sufficient to effect considerable dissociation in the sulfonium groups. Another possible reason lies in the polymer&apos;s unique solubility behavior in developing solutions. Destroying only a small portion of ionic sulfonium groups by irradiation, and consequently changing the polarity of the polymer, could bring about such a sharp solubility change in the developing solution. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The present invention also addresses one of the fundamental problems of projection optical lithography at 157 nm, namely improving the etch resistance and pattern stability in a resist, while maintaining the optical transparency that is required at this wavelength. This invention provides another fundamentally new way to synergistically combine organic and inorganic resist materials to approach this problem, namely, by incorporating POSS (polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane) inorganic clusters into polyacetal linkages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The advantages of combining the most useful properties of organic and inorganic resists have been examined above. Etch resistance, high temperature stability, pattern collapse, line-edge roughness, and other problems that can limit the applicability of organic resists, are often circumvented by resist technologies using inorganic materials. However, patterning at high doses and the difficulty in inorganic resist coating have hampered their applications. Additionally, while it has been demonstrated that inorganic resists are capable of exhibiting a higher contrast than standard organic resists, they often exhibit intrinsically lower sensitivity and require complex deposition methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Projection optical lithography at 157 nm employing an excimer F2 laser constitutes a valuable lithographic method, however materials containing unsaturated groups such as carbonyl (C&boxH;O bonds) and alkene (C&boxH;C bonds) have strong absorptions at this wavelength. As a result, resists that are utilitarian with 157 nm projection optical lithography must avoid these groups to achieve the necessary transparency at this wavelength. One method to achieve this goal is to use polymeric resists in which polymerization has occurred through these unsaturated groups, for example, polyacetals. However, it is also necessary the any substituents or side chains also be transparent at this wavelength, therefore a polymer containing Si&mdash;O bonds and C&mdash;F or C&mdash;Cl bonds is particularly utilitarian. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention, which utilizes a polyacetal polymeric resist incorporating Si&mdash;O&mdash;Si groups from a POSS moiety into the polyacetal which, along with the C&mdash;F linkages form the polymerized hexafluoroacetone, fulfills these objectives. General details of the preparation of a POSS-containing polyacetal are described in Example 20. In one embodiment, hexafluoroacetone &lsqb;(CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C&boxH;O&rsqb; can be condensed with POSS disilanols such as disilanol cyclopentyl POSS (Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>(c-C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>(OH)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), disilanol isobutyl POSS (Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>(i-C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>(OH)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), or dimethylphenyldisilanol cyclopentyl POSS (Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>(c-C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>(OSiMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ph)(OH)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), in the presence of an acid catalyst such as toluene sulfonic acid. A slight excess of the POSS disilanol is used to ensure the presence of hydroxyl end groups in the oligomers and polymer. The resulting acetal oligomers and polyacetals have excellent film-forming and adhesion properties on a silicon wafer due to the presence of the POSS silicon oxide units. A variety of halogenated ketones and aldehydes may be used as precursors for the polyacetal, including, but not limited to, hexafluoroacetone, trifluoroacetone, hexachloroacetone, trichloroacetone, trifluoroacetaldehyde, trichloroacetaldehyde, thiocarbonylfluoride, hexafluorothioacetone, mixtures thereof, and derivatives thereof. In addition to fluorine- and chlorine-substituted aldehydes and ketones, bromo- and iodo-substituted aldehydes and ketones are also useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Resists prepared in this fashion are blended with photoacid generating groups (PAGs) including ionic PAGs such as sulfonium and ionium salts, as well as nonionic PAGs. Thus, upon exposure to radiation, especially 157 nm projection optical lithography employing an excimer F2 laser, the polyacetals prepared in this fashion are susceptible to acid-catalyzed cleavage. The incorporation of the silicon oxide moieties in these resists provides the necessary etch resistance. All types of wavelengths and sources used for lithography are useful for such a resist, but these POSS-containing polyacetals are especially useful for 157 nm lithography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort may be had to various other embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, may suggest themselves to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention or the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>

DSC measurements were carried out at a temperature ramp rate of 20&deg; C./min under an N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>flow of 40 ml/min. The results of these experiments are shown in Table 2. The results are interpreted based upon the assumption that if inorganic particles are miscible in the polymer, and have strong interactions with polymer materials, then the composite will exhibit a higher glass transition temperature (T<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>) that the pure polymer, as particles can be treated as a crosslinking agent. Otherwise the composite will show a lower T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>as the particles behave as a plasticizer (See: E. Bourgeat-Lami, P. Espiard, A. Guyot, S. Briat, C.

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> One concern about silica nanoparticles is that they might decrease the sensitivity and contrast of the host resist ZEP520.&reg; To investigate the effect of silica nanoparticles on the host resist, normalized residual thickness (NRT) curves were measured for both a silica incorporated ZEP520&reg; nanocomposite and pure ZEP520&reg; under identical conditions. Electron-beam lithography was performed with a scanning electron microscope equipped with a pattern generator. During all the experiments, the e-beam energy was fixed at 20 keV. Since at relatively high loadings of silica nanoparticles a phase separation occurred, only a sample with 4.0% by wt Si<highlight><subscript>8</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>(OSiMe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>nanoparticles in ZEP520&reg; was examined in this study. The normalized residual thickness (NRT) versus electron exposure curve, obtained by comparing the thickness of the exposed area with that of the nearest unexposed area, revealed that the incorporation of silica nanoparticles had no significant effect on ZEP520&reg; in terms of sensitivity and contrast. Thus, the silica nanoparticle/ZEP520 nanocomposites exhibited high sensitivity (less than 8 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) and high contrast values (&tilde;2.5), close to the values of reported in the literature for pure ZEP520&reg;. See: K. E. Gonsalves, Y. Hu, H. Wu, R. Panepucci and L. Merhari; Forefront of Lithographic Materials Research-Proceedings of the 12<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>Int. Conf. On Photopolymers, McAfee N.J. 2000, SPE Mid Hudson Section, 2001, p 51.; H. Ito, M. M. Khojatseh and W. Li, Hopewell Junction, N.Y.

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As a preliminary assessment of the lithographic performance of the nanocomposite resist, the line widths and resolution of the patterns (isolated lines) drawn with the e-beam (20 keV, 25 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) in the silica nanoparticles/ZEP520&reg; film were compared with those in ZEP520&reg; films patterned under the same conditions. This assessment involved writing lines with an electron beam with the objective of obtaining 60 nm and 40 nm widths in an ca. 400 nm thick, unmodified ZEP520&reg; film. This experiment resulted in linewidths of 230 nm and 131 nm, respectively. However when the same lines were drawn in the ca. 400 nm thick nanocomposite film (4.0 wt % nanoparticle loading), the obtained linewidths were 69 nm and 47 nm, respectively. In this case, the resolution was close to the e-beam diameter, with less than 20% line broadening observed. </paragraph>

The pattern totally collapsed when the line space reached 1 w, i.e. 60 nm. However with a line space of 2w, i.e., 120 nm, the writing pattern showed a good mechanical stability.

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The same patterns written on pure ZEP520&reg; under the same dose at 50 keV gave a broader trench with a width of 121 nm, more than 100% broadening effect due to the proximity effects of the electron beam. Although the trench was still distinguishable when the line space reached 2 w, i.e. 120 nm, the pattern began to collapse at this spacing as indicated by a much wider trench. At 100 keV, the deterioration of the written pattern was even more obvious compared with the results obtained with nanocomposite of silica nanoparticle/ZEP520&reg;. The pattern written at 100 keV on pure ZEP520&reg; gave 110 nm trenches and began to collapse when the line spacing was 2 w.

The solution was filtered through a 0.5 &mgr;m Teflon microfilter into a sealed flask. Three successive freeze-pump-thaw cycles were run to remove oxygen from the sample. The clear solution was then placed in a 60&deg; C. oil bath under stirring. The reaction was maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 day to achieve high conversion. After this time, the reaction mixture was added dropwise, with stirring, into sufficient hexane to precipitate the polymer. The polymer was filtered off and washed thoroughly with hexane. Samples of polymer isolated in this fashion were purified by reprecipitation from THF/hexane. Finally the samples were dried under vacuum at 60&deg; C. for 1-2 days. </paragraph>

The relative composition of the monomers POSS, MMA, TBMA and MAA in a resulting polymer sample were calculated from the area ratios of their characteristic peaks. These data are presented below in Table 2. In parallel, the POSS content was also determined independently by TGA using the following procedure. Approximately 10 mg of polymer sample was placed on a TGA pan and heated at a heating rate of 20&deg; C./min from room temperature to 800&deg; C. in pure oxygen with a gas flow rate of 25 ml/min, and maintained at 800&deg; C. for 0.5 h. The weight loss of the sample over this process was used to calculate the sample&apos;s POSS content, based upon the assumption that any residue remaining after burning the polymer sample in oxygen constituted pure silicon dioxide. This assumption was validated by burning the POSS monomer using the same procedure and performing the same calculations. By this procedure, the POSS monomer data, which was measured to have a 46.86% weight loss after burning, was well in agreement with the calculated value of 46.81%. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Resist solutions (typically 5-10 wt %) were formulated by dissolving polymer samples, along with 2% by weight (relative to the polymer) of the photoacid generator (PAG) triphenyl sulfonium hexafluoroantimonate, in PGME. The low-POSS samples (&lt;22.5% POSS) were readily soluble in PGME without heating, while the high-POSS sample (30.5%) must be heated to 40&deg; C. to achieve fast dissolution. The resist solutions were filtered through a 0.2 &mgr;m Teflon micro filter to remove any undissolved residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Thin films were spin cast on 3-inch silicon wafers on a Brewer/CEE Model 6000 Wafer Processing Track System using a spinning speed of 1500 rpm and spinning times of 60 sec. The films were then baked on a hot plate at 125&deg; C. for 3 min. After cooling to room temperature, the resist-coated wafer was placed in the plasma chamber of the etcher (Plasma Therm System 72 Reactive Ion Etcher), with half of the resist-coated wafer covered with a specially-fit glass slide. Typical etching conditions were 60 mtorr pressure, a power density of 0.25 W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and either CF<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>or O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. plasma gases, with gas flow rates of 12.6 and 30 sccm for CF<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, respectively. Etch rates were calculated by dividing the thickness difference between the slide-covered and uncovered areas on the resist film by etch times, and are recorded in Table 3. Film thickness was measured on a Tencor AlphaStep 200 Surface Profilometer. Etching times were carefully selected to ensure that the uncovered area of the resist film was not entirely eroded away during the etch process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) samples were prepared from acetone solutions of the polymers and deposited on copper grids with a carbon film. HRTEM studies were performed on a JEOL-4000EX microscope with a point-to-point resolution of approximately 1.7 &angst;. The TEM images were obtained under optimum defocus conditions in which the atom columns appear as block dots. Images were digitized using a high-resolution camera and then computer-processed to reduce the noise arising from the matrix. HRTEM revealed that the RIE improvement was due to the formation of rectangular crystallite-constituting networks of the silica cages, uniformly distributed within the polymer matrix.

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> For imaging experiments, resist formulation and film preparation were the same as those described in Example 9 for etch study. Resist film that was spin-cast on 3-inch Si wafers from PGME solutions and were pre-baked at 125&deg; C. for 2 min. All samples had good solubility in PGME, even though they contained inorganic side groups. The exposure experiments were performed on a Leo 982 SEM with a pattern generator using 20 KeV electron beam. Similar exposure experiments were performed using under UV irradiation at a wavelength of 248 nm. Subsequently, the exposed films were post-baked on a hotplate at 125&deg; C. for 1 min. Development was effected by dipping the films into a 0.02 N TMAH solution for 1 min, followed by rinsing with deionized (DI) water. The resulting images were evaluated by SEM after a 20 nm gold thin film was sputtered over the resist films. The POSS-containing samples did not decrease the sensitivity of resists because of its inorganic component. Doses from 2 to 30 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>created equally good images. For example, micrographs showing isolated lines with a dimension of 228 nm imaged under 248 nm DUV were obtained for sample 9c at 20 keV. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Resist films were spin cast onto 3-inch Si wafers whose weights were predetermined on a analytical balance, from 10% wt resist solutions in acetone. The resist films were then baked at 130&deg; C. for 5 min to remove the solvent, weighed again, and the amount of resist film on the Si wafer was determined by calculating the weight difference. The resist films were then exposed to 254 nm DUV radiation (254 nm UV lamp, model R52G, UVP, Inc., Upland, Calif.) equipped with a radiometer. Doses were calculated by exposure times multiplied by lamp intensity. Each film to be analyzed was stripped from the Si wafer with acetonitrile and added to 2 ml of a stock solution of 0.1 mM tetrabromophenol blue (TBPB) in acetonitrile. The total volume was then raised to 10 ml by the addition of acetonitrile. The resulting solution was characterized by UV spectroscopy. The amount of acid generated in each film by UV radiation was determined by monitoring the absorbance change of the TBPB indicator at 620 nm, against calibration curves predetermined by using known amounts of triflic acid. Calibration curves showed a linear relationship between the amount acid added to the indicator solution and the resulting absorbance intensity change at 620 nm. For comparison, the acid generating efficiency for each resist is expressed as mole of acid/mole of PAG units in the resist. The number of moles of PAG units in each resist was determined by elemental analysis and resist weight. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> For chemically amplified (CA) resists containing photoacid generating groups (PAG) in the chain, thin films were spin-coated onto 5-inch silicon wafers from 5 wt % polymer solutions in propylene glycol methyl ether (PGME). All resist films were prebaked at 125&deg; C. for 2 min before exposure. The exposure experiments were performed on a Nikon EX7 DUV 248 nm Excimer Laser Stepper, after which the exposed films were post baked on a hotplate at 125&deg; C. for 1 min. For these CA resists, development was achieved by dipping the films in 0.26 N tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) for 1 min, followed by rinsing with deionized water. The resulting images were evaluated by SEM after a 20 nm gold thin film was sputtered over the resist films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The resists were also found to be very sensitive to electron beam radiation. The imaging experiments were carried out on a Leo 982 SEM with a Nabity pattern generator at 20 keV. The processing conditions were almost identical to the photo-exposure at 248 nm. All samples exhibited very high sensitivity under both 248 nm deep-UV and 20 keV electron exposures. </paragraph>

A typical procedure is as follows. A solution of about 5 g of PAG monomer and 1 wt % AIBN relative to the monomer was prepared in acetonitrile and filtered through a 0.5 &mgr;m Teflon micro filter into a sealed flask. Three freeze-pump-thaw cycles were carried out to remove oxygen from the sample. The resulting clear solution was then placed in a 60&deg; C. oil bath in a nitrogen atmosphere, under stirring. The reaction was stirred at this temperature for 1-2 days to achieve high conversion to the polymer. After this time, the reaction mixture was added dropwise into sufficient hexane to precipitate the polymer, which was isolated by filtration and and washed thoroughly with hexane. This PAG homopolymer was purified by dissolving in methanol and re-precipitation from THF. Finally the purified sample was dried in vacuum at 60&deg; C. for 1 to 2 days. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> For chemically amplified (CA) resists containing photoacid generating groups (PAG) in the chain, thin films were spin-coated onto 5-inch silicon wafers from 5 wt % polymer solutions in water. The dissolution rate of the polymer in water was very slow at room temperature. An elevated temperature of about 50&deg; C. was used to rapidly dissolve the polymer in water. All resist films were prebaked at 125&deg; C. for 2 min before exposure. The exposure experiments were performed on a Nikon EX7 DUV 248 nm Excimer Laser Stepper. After exposure, the PAG homopolymer required no post bake process. Development of the exposed homopolymer was achieved by dipping the films in water with a pH of 7.2-7.5, adjusted by adding tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) for about 1 min, followed by rinsing with deionized water. The resulting images were evaluated by SEM after a 20 nm gold thin film was sputtered over the resist films. Thus, SEM micrographs of a negative-tone pattern obtained for this resist by exposure to 248 nm radiation at a dose of 50 mJ/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>revealed a feature dimension of approximately 250 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> It was also found that this polymer was also very sensitive to electron beam radiation.

Accordingly, SEM micrographs of negative-tone lines obtained for this resist at a dose of 25&deg; C./cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>provided line dimensions of approximately 200 nm. </paragraph>

A slight excess of the POSS disilanol is used to ensure the presence of hydroxyl end groups in the resulting oligomers and polymer. The water generated during the reaction is continuously distilled off as the polymerization reaction proceeds. The resulting acetal oligomers and polyacetals have excellent film-forming and adhesion properties on a silicon wafer due to the presence of the POSS silicon oxide units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Resists prepared in this fashion are blended with photoacid generating groups (PAGs) including ionic PAGs such as sulfonium and ionium salts, as well as nonionic PAGs. Thus, upon exposure to radiation, especially 157 nm projection optical lithography employing an excimer F2 laser, the polyacetals prepared in this fashion are susceptible to acid catalyzed cleavage. The incorporation of the silicon oxide moieties in resists of this type provides the necessary etch resistance. A variety of radiation sources may be used, including but not limited to, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) or deep ultraviolet (DUV) radiation, X-rays, electron beams, and ion beams, however this resist is especially useful for 157 nm lithography. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to ionic conjugates including inorganic particles and macromolecules, and more particularly to an electrostatic conjugate useful in detecting the presence or absence of specific species, such as for detecting a biological target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Labeling of biological molecules using fluorescent tags is a common and useful practice in biological science. Fluorescent small molecules (conventional organic dyes) are used in both single and simultaneous multiple detection approaches. However, biological tagging using organic fluorophores has significant limitations. Fluorescent molecules tend to have narrow absorption spectra and their emission spectra are usually broad and exhibit red tailing, making simultaneous quantitative evaluation of relative amounts of different probes present in the same sample difficult due to spectral cross talk between various detection channels. Furthermore, any desired variations of the absorption and/or emission spectra of tagged bioconjugates require the use of distinct molecular labels with attendant synthesis and bioconjugation challenges. Nonetheless, the use of multiple labels has achieved a considerable level of sophistication, as demonstrated by recent flow cytometry work involving a three-laser system and eight-color marking scheme to simultaneously measure a total of 10 parameters on cellular antigens. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An ionic conjugate forms through self-assembly in which inorganic particles electrostatically attach associate with at least one macromolecule. One type of association is self-assembly. Self-assembly is a coordinated action of independent entities under distributed (i.e., non-central) control to produce a larger structure or to achieve a desired group effect. Instances of self-assembly occur in biology, e.g., embryology and morphogenesis, and in chemistry, e.g., the formation of more loosely bound supramolecular structures from groups of molecules. Self-assembly of ionic conjugates is driven by noncovalent binding such as electrostatic interactions between charged, ionizable, or chargeable linking groups of the inorganic particles and complementary groups of the macromolecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Each of the macromolecules can also include a moiety that reacts with or exhibits an affinity for a predetermined chemical species or biological target. For example, the macromolecule can include an antibody, polynucleotide, or cell membrane having a charged, ionizable, or chargeable linking group. Alternatively, a macromolecule that does not react with or exhibit an affinity for a predetermined chemical species or biological target can be attached to a biological moiety with such properties. In this instance, the macromolecule portion electrostatically self-assembles with the inorganic particle and the biological moiety interacts with a predetermined chemical species or biological target. As a result, the macromolecules forming the self-assembled supramolecular structures can be preselected so that the ionic conjugate will include a macromolecule that will directly or indirectly react with or exhibit affinity for a specific species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Inorganic particles such as semiconductor nanocrystals provide a solution to many of the problems encountered by organic small molecules in fluorescent tagging applications, by offering advantages such as a high photo-bleaching threshold, excellent chemical stability, and readily tunable spectral properties. Combining the size-dependent luminescence emission properties of the nanocrystals, their wide range of useful excitation and emission wavelengths, resistance to photo-bleaching, and a high quantum yield in aqueous solutions (high sensitivity) makes these materials very attractive for the labeling of biological targets via a self-assembled nanocrystal-macromolecule in which the macromolecule contains a moiety having an affinity for a specific biological target. </paragraph>

The macromolecule can be a fusion protein having a second charged or ionizable moiety, wherein the first and second charged or ionizable moieties electrostatically associates the inorganic particle with the fusion protein to form an ionic conjugate. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method of forming an ionic conjugate from a modified inorganic particle and a macromolecule. Both the particle and molecule include charged or ionizable linking groups which together can form complimentary ionic pairs to electrostatically attach at least one macromolecule to the particle. The inorganic particle can be modified by bonding one charged or ionizable linking group to the particle surface. The macromolecule can be a modified protein, such as by a recombinant protein process, to incorporate one end of a charged or ionizable linking group, such as a chargeable polypeptide, onto the protein&apos;s surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features, a recombinant protein electrostatically attached to a semiconducting nanoparticle. The recombinant protein can be a fusion protein including any protein imparting biological activity which has been modified, for example, to include a basic leucine zipper. The leucine zipper is a chargeable polypeptide having one end bound to the protein and another end unbound and protruding away from the surface of protein. The zipper also includes a thiol group which can form a covalent bond with the thiol group of a leucine zipper of another fusion protein to form a dimer of fusion proteins. The semiconducting nanoparticle can include dihydrolipoic acid groups which electrostatically interact with the unbound end of the basic leucine zipper to form the ionic conjugate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a nanoparticle having a core and overcoat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> During routine preparation, an inorganic core of the nanocrystal is capped with an organic shell such as a trioctyl phosphine and trioctyl phosphine oxide mixture (TOP/TOPO), which can be further modified and thereby, permit post synthesis manipulation and tailoring of particle solubility in various solvents. Overcoating the CdSe core, for example, with a larger band gap semiconducting material, e.g., ZnS or CdS, a process based on the concepts of band-gap engineering used in electronics, permits passivation of core surface states and reduces the leakage of excitons outside the core. This overcoating enhances the photochemical stability of these materials and improves the luminescence quantum yield substantially without affecting the wavelength and the spectral width of the emission, i.e., CdSe&mdash;ZnS nanoparticles have an FWHM&tilde;40-60 nm. In addition, overcoating can enhance resistance to photo-bleaching. The above properties enhance the sensitivity of detection approaches employing these nanoparticles for signal generation. Substantial PL intensities with good signal-to-noise ratios, along with well-resolved spectra, are measured for dispersions with concentrations much smaller than 1 nanomole of nanoparticles per liter. Replacing the TOP/TOPO cap with polar terminated groups allows dispersal of these core-overcoat nanoparticles in aqueous solutions with preservation of a high photoluminescence quantum yield. Presence of a dihydrolipoic acid provided stable water dispersions of CdSe&mdash;ZnS nanoparticles with quantum yields of 15-20%. The dihydrolipoic acid groups on the surface of the nanoparticles are charged or ionizable groups which electrostatically attach to complimentary charged or ionizable groups of a macromolecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The ionic conjugates of this invention exhibit biological activity, are chemically stabile, and exhibit increased quantum yield relative to inorganic particles lacking an electrostatically bound protein. The conjugates also unexpectedly exhibit reduced aggregation relative to biological conjugates in which a biological moiety is covalently bound directly to the inorganic particle. Another advantage of the process of producing ionic conjugates of this invention is its simplicity and versatility. For example, the desired protein attaches to the surface of the inorganic particle nearly instantaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Ionic conjugates including CdSe nanocrystals overcoated with ZnS and dithiol capping groups and self-assembled with macromolecules offer several advantages: 1) because each dithiol-capping molecule can attach to two surface atoms, a higher surface passivation can be achieved with equal or even smaller density of capping groups per unit area, in comparison with mono-thiol capping molecules, for instance. 2) The carboxylic acid groups, which permit dispersion of the nanocrystals in water solutions at basic pH, also provides a surface charge distribution that can be used to directly self-assemble (or react) with other macromolecules having a net positive charge. 3) The ZnS coverage provides a better shielding of the CdSe core from the polar environment and a more efficient confinement of the exciton (electron-hole pair), which results in stable and highly luminescent nanocrystal dispersions in water. Dispersions of core-overcoat nanocrystals in water that are stable over a long period of time (several months) and a photoluminescence quantum yield of &tilde;20% are easily prepared using the above approach. 4) The synthetic approach can be easily applied to a number of different core-overcoat nanocrystals and extended to other combinations of semiconducting materials, II-VI and III-V, which can generate a group of fluorescent probes that can be spectrally tuned. This contrasts with the need of developing specific chemistry routes for each organic fluorescent dye case-by-case. 5) The synthesis of a macromolecule such as fusion proteins based on the construction vector strategy provides a general and consistent scheme to prepare a wide selection of biological macromolecules that can perform specific functions and self-assemble with the nanocrystals. 6) The recombinant protein approach permits one to perform alterations of charged or ionizable portion of the macromolecule, e.g., charge, size, stability to pH and temperature, and thereby allow one to vary and control the self-assembly of the macromolecule such as to form monomers, dimers and tetramers of macromolecules which can self-assemble onto the inorganic particle. Each of the macromolecules can include moieties having affinities for the same or different biological agents. 7) Controlling the properties of the peptide tail permits these proteins to interact non-covalently with a variety of materials (e.g., inorganic colloidal particles and even surfaces) that have opposite charge to those on the linker tail of the proteins. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The ionic conjugates include an inorganic particle electrostatically associated with a macromolecule. The macromolecule can be selected to interact with a predetermined species. As a result, the ionic conjugates can be used in assays to detect the presence of or to quantify the amounts of specific compounds, detect specific interactions of biological systems, detect specific biological processes, detect alterations in specific biological processes, or detect alterations in the structure of specific compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an ionic conjugate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an inorganic particle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a macromolecule <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> each of which include a linking group <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, respectively, to associatively bind particle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to macromolecule <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at ends <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Ends <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> are charged or ionizable, i.e., the ends can contain localized amounts of positive or negative charge, and form complementary ionic or electrostatic pairs, such as a partial negative charge on end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a partial positive on charge <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, or vice versa. In general, macromolecule <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a linking group at any location in or on the macromolecule that is accessible to interact electrostatically with linking group <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to attach the macromolecule to inorganic particle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Typically, the charged or ionizable portion of linking group <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> extends (protrudes) away from the macromolecule <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In general the inorganic particle can be any inorganic material exhibiting a distinct physical property that can be used to identify that material. The physical properties can be, but are not limited to, magnetic properties or optical properties. Optical properties include, but are not limited to, emission such as photoluminescence, absorption, scattering and plasmon resonances. For example, the inorganic particle can be illuminated with a light source at an absorption wavelength to cause an emission at an emission wavelength that can be used to distinguish the emitting material from other materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Examples of inorganic particles include, but are not limited to, inorganic colloids and semiconducting nanoparticles. The particles can be metallic or magnetic particles. The particles also can be crystalline particles. Examples of inorganic colloids include Ag, Au, or a phosphor. The phosphor can be a inorganic phosphor, such as a rare earth oxide. The inorganic colloids can exhibit distinct reflectivity and scattering properties, plasmon resonances, to radiation depending on the size of the particles in the colloid. Examples of semiconducting nanoparticles include, but are not limited to, elements from groups II-VI, III-V, and IV of the periodic table. Elements from these groups include, but are not limited to, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, MgTe, GaAs, GaP, GaSb, GaN, HgS, HgSe, HgTe, InAs, InP, InSb, InN, AlAs, AlP, AlSb, AlS, PbS, PbSe, Ge, Si, or an alloy or mixture thereof, including ternary and quaternary mixtures. The semiconducting nanoparticles can be semiconducting nanocrystals. The nanocrystals can be illuminated with a light source at an absorption wavelength to cause an emission at an emission wavelength. The emission has a frequency that corresponds to the band gap of the quantum confined semiconductor material. The band gap is a function of the size of the nanocrystal. Nanocrystals having small diameters can have properties intermediate between molecular and bulk forms of matter. For example, nanocrystals based on semiconductor materials having small diameters can exhibit quantum confinement of both the electron and hole in all three dimensions, which leads to an increase in the effective band gap of the material with decreasing crystallite size. Consequently, both the optical absorption and emission of nanocrystals shift to the blue (i.e., to higher energies) as the size of the crystallites decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The emission from the nanocrystal can be a narrow Gaussian emission band that can be tuned through the complete wavelength range of the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared regions of the spectrum by varying the size of the nanocrystal, the composition of the nanocrystal, or both. For example, CdSe can be tuned in the visible region and InAs can be tuned in the infrared region. The narrow size distribution of a population of nanocrystals can result in emission of light in a narrow spectral range. The population can be monodisperse and can exhibit less than a 15% rms deviation in diameter of the nanocrystals, preferably less than 10%, more preferably less than 5%. Spectral emissions in a narrow range of no greater than about 75 nm, preferably 60 nm, more preferably 40 nm, and most preferably 30 nm full width at half max (FWHM) can be observed. The breadth of the emission decreases as the polydispersity of nanocrystal diameters decreases. Semiconductor nanocrystals can have high emission quantum efficiencies such as greater than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor forming the nanocrystals can include Group II-VI compounds, Group II-V compounds, Group III-VI compounds, Group III-V compounds, Group IV-VI compounds, Group I-III-VI compounds, Group II-IV-VI compounds, and Group II-IV-V compounds, for example, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, HgS, HgSe, HgTe, AlN, Alp, AlAs, AlSb, GaN, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, GaSe, InN, InP, InAs, InSb, TlN, TlP, TlAs, TlSb, PbS, PbSe, PbTe, or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Methods of preparing monodisperse semiconductor nanocrystals include pyrolysis of organometallic reagents, such as dimethyl cadmium, injected into a hot, coordinating solvent. This permits discrete nucleation and results in the controlled growth of macroscopic quantities of nanocrystals. Preparation and manipulation of nanocrystals are described, for example, in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/969,302, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The method of manufacturing a nanocrystal is a colloidal growth process. Colloidal growth occurs by rapidly injecting an M donor and an X donor into a hot coordinating solvent. The injection produces a nucleus that can be grown in a controlled manner to form a nanocrystal. The reaction mixture can be gently heated to grow and anneal the nanocrystal. Both the average size and the size distribution of the nanocrystals in a sample are dependent on the growth temperature. The growth temperature necessary to maintain steady growth increases with increasing average crystal size. The nanocrystal is a member of a population of nanocrystals. As a result of the discrete nucleation and controlled growth, the population of nanocrystals obtained has a narrow, monodisperse distribution of diameters. The monodisperse distribution of diameters can also be referred to as a size. The process of controlled growth and annealing of the nanocrystals in the coordinating solvent that follows nucleation can also result in uniform surface derivatization and regular core structures. As the size distribution sharpens, the temperature can be raised to maintain steady growth. By adding more M donor or X donor, the growth period can be shortened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The M donor can be an inorganic compound, an organometallic compound, or elemental metal. M is cadmium, zinc, magnesium, mercury, aluminum, gallium, indium or thallium. The X donor is a compound capable of reacting with the M donor to form a material with the general formula MX. Typically, the X donor is a chalcogenide donor or a pnictide donor, such as a phosphine chalcogenide, a bis(silyl) chalcogenide, dioxygen, an ammonium salt, or a tris(silyl) pnictide. Suitable X donors include dioxygen, bis(trimethylsilyl) selenide ((TMS)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Se), trialkyl phosphine selenides such as (tri-n-octylphosphine) selenide (TOPSe) or (tri-n-butylphosphine) selenide (TBPSe), trialkyl phosphine tellurides such as (tri-n-octylphosphine) telluride (TOPTe) or hexapropylphosphorustriamide telluride (HPPTTe), bis(trimethylsilyl)telluride ((TMS)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te), bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide ((TMS)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>S), a trialkyl phosphine sulfide such as (tri-n-octylphosphine) sulfide (TOPS), an ammonium salt such as an ammonium halide (e.g., NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Cl), tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphide ((TMS)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P), tris(trimethylsilyl) arsenide ((TMS)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>As), or tris(trimethylsilyl) antimonide ((TMS)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Sb). In certain embodiments, the M donor and the X donor can be moieties within the same molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A coordinating solvent can help control the growth of the nanocrystal. The coordinating solvent is a compound having a donor lone pair that, for example, has a lone electron pair available to coordinate to a surface of the growing nanocrystal. Solvent coordination can stabilize the growing nanocrystal. Typical coordinating solvents include alkyl phosphines, alkyl phosphine oxides, alkyl phosphonic acids, or alkyl phosphinic acids, however, other coordinating solvents, such as pyridines, furans, and amines may also be suitable for the nanocrystal production. Examples of suitable coordinating solvents include pyridine, tri-n-octyl phosphine (TOP) and tri-n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO). Technical grade TOPO can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Size distribution during the growth stage of the reaction can be estimated by monitoring the absorption line widths of the particles. Modification of the reaction temperature in response to changes in the absorption spectrum or emission spectrum of the particles allows the maintenance of a sharp particle size distribution during growth. Reactants can be added to the nucleation solution during crystal growth to grow larger crystals. By stopping growth at a particular nanocrystal average diameter and choosing the proper composition of the semiconducting material, the emission spectra of the nanocrystals can be tuned continuously over the wavelength range of 400 nm to 800 nm. The nanocrystal has a diameter of less than 150 &angst;. A population of nanocrystals has average diameters in the range of 15 &angst;to 125 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The nanocrystal can be a member of a population of nanocrystals having a narrow size distribution. The nanocrystal can be a sphere, rod, disk, or other shape. The nanocrystal can include a core of a semiconductor material. The nanocrystal can include a core having the formula MX, where M is cadmium, zinc, magnesium, mercury, aluminum, gallium, indium, thallium, or mixtures thereof, and X is oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The core can have an overcoating on a surface of the core. The overcoating can be a semiconductor material having a composition different from the composition of the core. The overcoat of a semiconductor material on a surface of the nanocrystal can include a Group II-VI compounds, Group II-V compounds, Group III-VI compounds, Group III-V compounds, Group IV-VI compounds, Group I-III-VI compounds, Group II-IV-VI compounds, and Group II-IV-V compounds, for example, ZnS, ZnO, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdS, CdO, CdSe, CdTe, MgS, MgSe, HgO, HgS, HgSe, HgTe, AlN, AlP, AlAs, AlSb, GaN, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, GaSe, InN, InP, InAs, InSb, TlN, TlP, TlAs, TlSb, PbS, PbSe, PbTe, SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or mixtures thereof. For example, ZnS, ZnSe or CdS overcoatings can be grown on CdSe or CdTe nanocrystals. An overcoating process is described, for example, in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/969,302, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. By adjusting the temperature of the reaction mixture during overcoating and monitoring the absorption spectrum or absorption spectrum of the core, over coated materials having high emission quantum efficiencies and narrow size distributions can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The particle size distribution can be further refined by size selective precipitation with a poor solvent for the nanocrystals, such as methanol/butanol as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 08/969,302, incorporated herein by reference. For example, nanocrystals can be dispersed in a solution of 10% butanol in hexane. Methanol can be added dropwise to this stirring solution until opalescence persists. Separation of supernatant and flocculate by centrifugation produces a precipitate enriched with the largest crystallites in the sample. This procedure can be repeated until no further sharpening of the optical absorption spectrum is noted. Size-selective precipitation can be carried out in a variety of solvent/nonsolvent pairs, including pyridine/hexane and chloroform/methanol. The size-selected nanocrystal population can have no more than a 15% rms deviation from mean diameter, preferably 10% rms deviation or less, and more preferably 5% rms deviation or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The outer surface of the nanocrystal can include a layer of compounds derived from the coordinating solvent used during the growth process. The surface can be modified by repeated exposure to an excess of a competing coordinating group to form an overlayer. For example, a dispersion of the capped nanocrystal can be treated with a coordinating organic compound, such as pyridine, to produce crystallites which disperse readily in pyridine, methanol, and aromatics but no longer disperse in aliphatic solvents. Such a surface exchange process can be carried out with any compound capable of coordinating to or bonding with the outer surface of the nanocrystal, including, for example, phosphines, thiols, amines and phosphates. The nanocrystal can be exposed to short chain polymers which exhibit an affinity for the surface and which terminate in a moiety having an affinity for a suspension or dispersion medium. Such affinity improves the stability of the suspension and discourages flocculation of the nanocrystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) can provide information about the size, shape, and distribution of the nanocrystal population. Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns can provided the most complete information regarding the type and quality of the crystal structure of the nanocrystals. Estimates of size are also possible since particle diameter is inversely related, via the X-ray coherence length, to the peak width. For example, the diameter of the nanocrystal can be measured directly by transmission electron microscopy or estimated from x-ray diffraction data using, for example, the Scherrer equation. It also can be estimated from the UV/Vis absorption spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A macromolecule can be any, organic or inorganic, species including a charged, chargeable, or ionizable group. The charged, chargeable, or ionizable group can be, but is not limited to, a carboxylate, a thiocarboxylate, an amide, a hydrazine, a sulfonate, a sulfoxide, a sulfone, a sulfite, a phosphate, a phosphonate, a phosphonium ion, an alcohol, a thiol, an amine, an ammonium, a quarternary ammonium, an alkyl ammonium, or a nitrate. For example, the ionizable group can be an acidic or basic side chain of an amino acid such as lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartate, or glutamate. The macromolecule can include a plurality of ionizable groups such in polylysine, poly (acrylic acid) (PAA), poly (allyl amine hydrochloride) (PAH), sulfonated polystyrene (SPS), and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDADMAC). The macromolecule can be a polypeptide or a polynucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The macromolecule can exhibit a specific interaction with a separate molecule or biological target. For example, the macromolecule can include a protein, antibody, DNA, RNA, or cell membrane, which binds, interacts, or complexes with a specific compound. Alternatively, a macromolecule that does not exhibit a desired affinity for a predetermined species can be attached to a chemical or biological moiety, such as a protein, antibody, DNA, RNA, or cell membrane, that exhibits the desired interaction. For example, the macromolecule can be attached to the chemical or biological moiety by biological processes, e.g., from cultures of recombinant organisms (bacteria, yeast, insect, or mammalian cells), or, alternatively, by totally synthetic or semi-synthetic methods. The biological moiety, whether RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, vectors, viruses or hybrids thereof, may be isolated from a variety of sources, genetically engineered, amplified, and/or expressed recombinantly. Any recombinant expression system can be used, including, in addition to bacterial cells, e.g., mammalian, yeast, insect or plant cell expression systems. Examples of biological moieties include maltose binding protein (MBP) and immunoglobulin G binding protein (Protein G). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, nucleic acids can be synthesized in vitro by well-known chemical synthesis techniques, as described in, e.g., Carruthers (1982) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 47:411-418; Adams (1983) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105:661; Belousov (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3440-3444; Frenkel (1995) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 19:373-380; Blommers (1994) Biochemistry 33:7886-7896; Narang (1979) Meth. Enzymol. 68:90; Brown (1979) Meth. Enzymol. 68:109; Beaucage (1981) Tetra. Lett. 22:1859; U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,066. Double stranded DNA fragments may then be obtained either by synthesizing the complementary strand and annealing the strands together under appropriate conditions, or by adding the complementary strand using DNA polymerase with an appropriate primer sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Techniques for the manipulation of nucleic acids, such as, e.g., generating mutations in sequences, subcloning, labeling probes, sequencing, hybridization and the like are well described in the scientific and patent literature, see, e.g., Sambrook, ed., Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual (2nd ed.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, (1989); Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel, ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1997); Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Hybridization With Nucleic Acid Probes, Part I. Theory and Nucleic Acid Preparation, Tijssen, ed. Elsevier, N.Y. (1993). Techniques for inserting a charged or ionizable macromolecule, such as leucine zippers, are also discussed in &ldquo;Peptide &lsquo;Velcro&rsquo;: Design of a Heterodimeric Coiled Coil,&rdquo; Current Biology 3(10), 658-667 (1993), by O&apos;Shea et al. and in &ldquo;Fiber-Optic Fluorometric Sensing of Polymerase Chain Reaction-Amplified DNA Using an Immobilized DNA Capture Protein,&rdquo; Analyt. Biochemistry 235, 61-72 (1996), by Mauro et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Recombinant (fusion) proteins can be prepared in a constructed plasmid (double stranded DNA) using appropriate cloning strategies, a technique familiar in bioengineering manipulation of molecules. The cloning and the protein expression steps can be carried out in <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>), which also serves as the growth environment. Appropriate and specific enzymes (restriction endonucleases) can be introduced to cut the plasmid at the proper polylinker cloning site where the gene with the specific function is introduced. A linking group such as a peptide tail can then be cloned on the carboxy terminal end of the coding region of the biological moieties having a desired function. Biological moieties include the maltose binding protein (MBP), which binds to the sugar maltose with high affinity, and protein G, which is known to specifically bind, through its b-subunit, to the Fc region of immoglobulin G (IgG). The biological moieties also can be further mutated such that the moieties exhibits a desired function, such as binding to a specific biological target. For instance, protein G can be modified both to interact with a specific molecule and to incorporate a leucine zipper functionality. Protein G then can be electrostatically attached to the inorganic particle and used to detect interactions with the specified biological target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A synthetic method for attaching the macromolecule to a biological moiety can be performed via known solid-phase peptide coupling technology. For example the macromolecule can be formed of a single covalently-linked polypeptide chain including an charged or ionizable portion and a portion exhibiting biological specificity. Synthetic methods for producing the macromolecule can include processes in which all or part of either or both constituent polypeptides, i.e., the charged or ionizable and biologically specific portions, forming the macromolecule are prepared using in vitro synthesis. Alternatively, all or part of either or both constituent polypeptide chains can be prepared using the above recombinant organism(s). For example, the charged or ionizable portion of a polypeptide can be produced synthetically and the biologically specific portion can be obtained by recombinant or synthetic methods. If the charged/ionizable and biologically specific portions are obtained independently, they can be attached by a) a chemical means after chemically activating the peptide termini, such as with EDC (1-ethyl-3,3-dimethylaminopropyl carbiimide) coupling, b) enzymatically assisted catalysis of activated or unactivated polypeptides, c) formation of disulfide (S&mdash;S) bonds promoted by oxidation utilizing O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or by additional chemical or enzymatic means, or d) by utilizing non-covalent electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions separate from the self-assembly interactions used to electrostatically attach a macromolecule to a particle. The synthetic methods also include attaching charged or ionizable portions by any of the above methods to polynucleic acid aptamers (DNA or RNA), peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomer, oligosaccharides, lipopolysacccharide, polydextrins, cyclic polydextrins, crown ethers or similar derivatives, and other natural or synthetic &ldquo;receptor&rdquo; species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In alternative synthetic approach, a self-assembled complex can be formed via an electrostatic conjugation of a positively charged polyelectrolyte, such as polydiallydimethlyammonium chloride, with a negatively charged phosphine-carboxylic acid complex, such as tris 2-carboxyethylphophine. The resulting complex can be coupled to the particles, with the phosphine groups providing a tether to bind to the particle surface, while the positively charged polymer facilitates particle water-soluble. The charged polymers can include terminal amine or hydroxyl groups, or can be copolymerized with an amino or hydroxyl group containing monomer, such as allyl amine and hydroxymethacrylate. Standard EDC-type coupling chemistry can be used to effectuate a linkage, such as via a peptide bond, between the amino or hydroxyl groups and a biological moiety to produce a self-assembled ionic conjugate that exhibits an specific biological affinity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, in some embodiments, the inorganic particle is a semiconducting nanocrystal <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> including a semiconducting core <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a overcoat <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> encapsulating the core. Semiconducting core <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and overcoat <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are made of the semiconducting elements described above. A plurality of linking groups <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> attach to a surface of overcoat <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via a surface interactive group <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> which associates with the materials of the overcoat or nanocrystal. Typically, the band gap energy of the overcoat material is larger than the band gap energy of the core. Each linking group <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> also contains a charged or ionizable group <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> tethered to surface interactive group <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> by a spacer <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. In general, spacer <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is long enough to prohibit electron charge transfer between groups <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, in other embodiments, an inorganic particle <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of this invention is an inorganic colloid particle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> having a plurality of linking groups <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> attached to a surface of particle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> via a surface interactive group <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Linking group <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is similar to linking group <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> described above and includes a charged or ionizable group <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and a spacer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In general, the inorganic particles of this invention have a diameter between about 10 &angst; and about 1000 &angst;; preferably between about 10 &angst; and about 500 &angst;; and most preferably between about 10 &angst; and about 250 &angst;. The size dispersion about a mean size of the inorganic particles, typically, is less than about 20%; preferably less than about 15%; and more preferably less than about 10%; and most preferably less than about 5%. In general, more than about 40%; preferably more than about 50% fall; and most preferably more than about 60% of the particles fall within a specified particle size range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The surface interactive group can be any chemical moiety having elements or chemical groups contained therein that are capable of binding to the surface of the inorganic particle. For example, the surface group can include S, N, P, O, or O&boxH;P groups. Charged or ionizable groups <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> can include any ionizable chemical group or any chemical group having a native charge, such as a quarternary ammonium group. Examples of charged or ionizable chemical groups include, but are not limited to, hydroxides, alkoxides, carboxylate, sulfonate, phosphate, phosphonate, quaternary ammonium, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Linking groups <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> also help to form a water-solubilizing layer around the particles. In certain embodiments, the surface of the inorganic particle includes a plurality of linking groups, some of which help to water-solubilize the particle and do not electrostatically associate with macromolecules, and others which do. The linking groups also can make the particles more stable (i.e., the particles can be used in dilute concentrations). For example, a monodentate linking group can be put on the surface of the particle, and then by self-assembly, a monolayer of an oligomer can be wrapped around the particle to effectively cross-link the functional groups on the surface of the particle. Self-assembly permits control of assembling the ionic conjugates at the nanometer scale and is similar to the technique of layer-by-layer self-assembly (or sequential adsorption) used to assemble large synthetic and biological polymers. See for example &ldquo;Molecular-Level processing of Conjugated Polymers 0.1. Layer-by-Layer Manipulation of Conjugated Polyions,&rdquo; Macromolecules 28, 7107 (1995), by M. Ferreira and M. F.

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, a biological moiety <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, e.g., a recombinant protein having a specific biological function, includes protein <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and a linking group <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> protruding from the surface of protein <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Linking group <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> includes a coupling segment <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, such as a poly Asn linker, a bridging group <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, such as sulfur, and a tail <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. In certain embodiments, tail <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is a polypeptide including approximately 30 amino acid residues. For example, tail can be any polypeptide which is charged or ionizable, i.e., contains localized amounts of positive or negative charge. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> shows a positively charged tail <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> commonly referred to as a leucine zipper. Other possible tails include, but are not limited to, polypeptides including arginine or aspartate groups. Typically, proteins having a leucine zipper tend to form dimers to minimize hydrophobic interactions (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). The resulting dimers are a high probability state for proteins encoded with leucine. Dimer <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, includes two separate proteins <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, which can be the same (a homodimer) or different (a heterodimer), linked via two bridging groups <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, e.g., thiol groups. Tails <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are attached to the surface of each protein through coupling group <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> which can be an atom or a molecule, such as a polypeptide. Each of the bridging groups and coupling groups can be the same or different. </paragraph>

In general, the biological moieties can electrostatically attach to the inorganic particle either as dimers or monomers. The dimer can be a homodimer or a heterodimer. Additionally, particle <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> can be electrostatically associated with several proteins which can be identical or different. A particle including different proteins can be used to simultaneously detect multiple biological targets of interest. Of course, the exact number of proteins attached to the particle depends on the diameter of the particle, the overall length of the linking groups, and the size of the protein.

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Synthesis of CdSe&mdash;ZnS-Lipoic Acid Nanoparticles: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Linking groups used to make semiconducting nanoparticles water soluble are attached to the surface of the semiconducting particle by exchanging trioctylphosphine (TOP)/trioctlyphosphineoxide (TOPO) groups on the surface of the particles with the desired linking group. A dihydrolipoic acid linking group was prepared by reducing commercially available lipoic acid (also called thioctic acid) purchased from Aldrich as a powder, with sodium borohydride (NaBH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>). See the procedure in A. F. Wagner, J. Organic Chemistry, 1956, 5079-81. The dihydrolipoic acid linking group increases the stability of the particle such that the modified particles can be used at much more dilute conditions. The procedure for exchanging the surface groups of the particles procedure is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A volume of semiconducting nanoparticles (CdSe&mdash;ZnS) prepared using the synthesis route based on growth and annealing of organometallic compounds at high temperature (See Dabbousi et al.), was taken from the growth solution and precipitated by the addition of methanol. The nanoparticles included a ZnS-overcoating (5-7 monolayers). The isolated precipitate was then redispersed in a minimum volume of approximately 1:10 solution of butanol:hexane. Again, the semiconducting nanoparticles are crashed out by the addition of methanol. The procedure of precipitating, redispersing, and precipitating was repeated 2-3 times, until most of the TOP/TOPT groups on the surface of the particle were removed. A ten to twenty fold excess (by weight) of the desired linking group was added to the moist precipitate. The mixture was placed in an oil bath (around 60-80&deg; C.) and stirred for approx. 3-12 hours. The group exchange procedure was stopped by removing the mixture from the oil bath. The mixture was diluted by adding a small amount of DMF (for approximately 200 mg of the desired linking group, 100-200 &mgr;l of DMF is sufficient). Separately, another solution with a slight molar excess (1.5:1) of potassium t-butoxide in a 1:10 volume of DMF:H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O is prepared and added to the semiconducting particle/DMF solution prepared above to protonate the lipoic acid groups. A whitish precipitate resulted, which was separated from the rest of the solution by centrifugation. The precipitate was readily dispersed in water. The nanocrystal dispersion was purified (from excess potassium t-butoxide and DMF) by concentrating from dilute solutions using an ultra-free centrifugal filtration device (from Millipore with cut off at &tilde;50,000 daltons), and redispersing in water. Repeating the operation 3 to 4 times provides clean (a purity of &tilde;95% or better) and stable dispersions in water, which have emission characteristics of the nanocrystals and a PL yield of &tilde;15-20%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In other synthetic schemes the base, tetramethylammonium hydroxide can be substituted for potassium t-butoxide in DMF. The former base though can be stored under air, whilst the latter needs to be kept in an inert atmosphere. The dihydrolipoic acid works best if it totally clear. If the reduction lipoic acid to produce dihydrolipoic acid is not complete, a yellow coloration of the solution will be evident. The yellow solution can be distilled (distills at 140&deg; C. under vacuum) to yield a clear solution of dihydrolipoic acid. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The MBP-leucine zipper fusion protein was electrostatically attached to the CdSe(core)-ZnS(overcoat)-dihydrolipoic acid modified semiconducting particles by mixing the fusion protein and inorganic particles in borate buffered solutions at pH &tilde;8-9. A pH greater than about 7 is most suitable for protein manipulation by preserving the nanocrystal solubility and imparting negative surface charge coverage. Simple addition of the MBP-leucine zipper fusion protein to a solution containing a fixed amount of nanocrystals in buffered solution yielded ionic bio-conjugates free of aggregates, irrespective of the mole ratio of inorganic particles to proteins. Typically, the ratio of inorganic particles to proteins is between 1 and 10. The inorganic particles had an average diameter of about 19 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The advantage of surface modification using the present method is its simplicity and versatility. It is only necessary to add the fusion protein to the particles to coat, and the desired protein attaches to the surface nearly instantaneously. Furthermore, in some instances coating of the inorganic particles with the biological moieties results in enhancement of the photoluminescence yield. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows that particles coated with the MBP-zipper protein have approximately a three-fold increase in luminescence intensity relative to particles which are not electrostatically associated with a biological moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The MBP-zipper coated nanocrystals (and particles) prepared via noncovalent cross-linking were also examined using fluorescence confocal microscopy imaging. FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>C show cross-sectional images using a laser scanning confocal microscope of solutions of MBP-Zipper bound to nanocrystals (core-overcoat with 19 &angst; core radius), along with an image of a sample of the same particles covalently cross-linked to ovalbumin via such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC or EDC). Covalent cross-linking procedure are discussed in &ldquo;Semiconductor Nanocrystals as Fluorescent Biological Labels,&rdquo; Science 281, 2013-2016 (1998), by Bruchez, Jr. et al.; &ldquo;Quantum Dot Bioconjugates for Ultrasensitive Nonisotopic Detection,&rdquo; Science 281, 2016-2018, by W. C. W. Chan, and S. Nie; and references cited therein. Significant aggregates (that manifest in a the appearance of constellation-like features) were formed when using the covalent method (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>), whereas ionic conjugates of inorganic particles coated with the MBP-zipper appeared identical to uncoated material (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>). The emission recorded in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> results from single particles and is characteristic of a stable and aggregation-free solutions. Additionally, the photoluminescence of the inorganic particles coated with the MBP-zipper (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference>) was increased relative to uncoated inorganic particles (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>) for thin films containing the comparable concentration of particles. For each image, the solution of ionic bioconjugates was excited at 488 nm, i.e., below the location of the first absorption peak of the nanoparticles. Appropriate filters were used to block out the excitation signal. Images of nanoparticles coated with ovalbumin using the covalent (EDAC) binding approach were also recorded along with images of pure nanoparticle (protein-free) and nanoparticles complexed to fusion proteins. Each image represents very thin slices (&tilde;15 micron thick and an area of 150&times;100 micron<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>each) along the laser path (exciting signal traveling vertically). The last images in the bottom of the figure represent the cut adjacent to the support surface (bottom of the optical dish). The green bright spots on the images represent luminescence emission from individual nanoparticles dispersed in the solution film. The results described above indicate that the present coating approach is effective in providing aggregation-free (even at very small scales) nanocrystal-protein bioconjugates. The samples are stable over a long period of time (months). The aggregates (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>) precipitate to the bottom of the sample by gravity, and leave non-reacted particles floating in the solution, which may give the false impression that covalently coated particles are stable and do not encounter large scale aggregation. Aggregation was even more pronounced in solutions where IgG is attached to the nanocrystals via EDAC (data not shown). </paragraph>

At pH of about 9, the photoluminescence increases as the number of fusion proteins electrostatically attached to the nanoparticle is increased. At a constant number of proteins complexed to the nanoparticles, the photoluminescence increased with increasing pH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In a subsequent experiment, the bioactivity of the ionic conjugates including the MBP was tested by passing the ionic conjugates through a column of amylose functionalized resins. The ionic conjugates bound to the resin as MBP interacted with amylose. Thus, the ionic conjugates maintained their bioactivity. Ionic conjugates bound to the amylose functionalized resins were released by washing the column with a maltose solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Cloning and Preparation of G-Basic Zipper Proteins </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The coding sequence for the IgG binding b2 sub-domain of streptococcal protein G (PG) was cloned and expressed in the <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>cloning vector pBad/HisB (an inducible expression vector from Invitrogen). The linker plus the leucine zipper tail were inserted downstream at the site 3&prime; away from the PG. In addition, a polyhistidine short chain (hexahistidine) was attached to the end of the leucine tail to facilitate purification of the final product. These successive gene manipulations provided a fusion streptococcal protein G that has an IgG b2 binding sub-domain and a leucine zipper charged tail, which plays a major role in the present coating scheme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Ionic conjugates including semiconducting nanoparticles (CdSe&mdash;ZnS) coated with protein G-zipper were synthesized via the method described above. However, the ratio of inorganic particles to biomolecules, typically, is less than the ratio of MBP-proteins to inorganic particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The resulting ionic bioconjugates were passed through a column containing resins functionalized with IgG and allowed to react for approximately 15 minutes. Washing the column with pure buffer solution resulted in the release of negligible amounts of ionic bio-conjugates. The functionalized column retained approximately 95-98% of the ionic bioconjugates. The percentage of ionic conjugates contained within the column was determined by monitoring the effluent from the column for luminescence indicative of the semiconducting particles. These results imply that protein G-zipper molecules bind to the inorganic particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> A number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of fracturing a subterranean formation which surrounds a well bore comprises the steps of providing a fracturing fluid, and injecting the fracturing fluid into the well bore at a pressure sufficient to form fractures in the subterranean formation which surrounds the well bore. The pressure is then released from the fracturing fluid, after which the fluid may be removed from the well and the well placed into production. The fracturing fluid comprises an aqueous liquid, a polysaccharide soluble or dispersible in the aqueous liquid in an amount sufficient to increase the viscosity of the aqueous liquid, an enzyme breaker which degrades said polysaccharide at a temperature above 180&deg; F. Fracturing fluid compositions and enzyme breaker systems useful for carrying out the invention are also disclosed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention concerns thermostable enzyme breakers for the hydrolysis of galactomannans in hydraulic fracturing fluids. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> When the pressure of oil or gas in a reservoir declines as oil or gas is taken from that reservoir, production from a well in that reservoir declines and the economic viability of the well declines until it is no longer profitable to operate (even though it continues to produce gas or oil). Production can be increased from such wells through oil well stimulation. In addition, where forming a bore hole into a reservoir is very expensive, such as in offshore drilling, it is desirable to stimulate production from a single well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Oil well stimulation typically involves injecting a fracturing fluid into the well bore at extremely high pressures to create fractures in the rock formation surrounding the bore. The fractures radiate outwardly from the well bore, typically from 100 to 1000 meters, and extend the surface area from which oil or gas drains into the well. The fracturing fluid typically carries a propping agent, or &ldquo;proppant&rdquo;, such as sand, so that the fractures are propped open when the pressure on the fracturing fluid is released, and the fracture closes around the propping agent. This leaves a zone of high permeability (the propping agent trapped and compacted in the fracture in the subterranean formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The fracturing fluid typically contains a water soluble polymer, such a guar gum or a derivative thereof, which provides appropriate flow characteristics to the fluid and suspends the proppant particles therein. When pressure on the fracturing fluid is released and the fracture closes around the propping agent, water is forced therefrom and the water-soluble polymer forms a compacted cake. This compacted cake can prevent oil or gas flow if not removed. To solve this problem, &ldquo;breakers&rdquo; are included in the fracturing fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Currently, breakers are either enzymatic breakers or oxidative breakers. The enzyme breakers are preferable, because (a) they are true &ldquo;catalysts&rdquo;, (b) they are relatively high in molecular weight and do not leak off into the surrounding formation, and (c) they are less susceptible to dramatic changes in activity by trace contaminants. Oxidative breakers, on the other hand, are low in molecular weight and leak off into the formation, and they are active only over a very narrow temperature range. Enzyme breakers, however, are inactive at higher temperatures, limiting their use to shallow wells. It would accordingly be highly desirable to have enzyme breakers that operate at higher temperatures to enable fracturing of deep wells. See generally J. Gulbis, Fracturing Fluid Chemistry, in RESERVOIR STIMULATION, Chap. 4 (J. J. Economides and K. G. Nolte, Eds., 2d Ed. 1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,996,153 to Cadmus and Slodki discloses a heat-stable enzyme breaker which may be used as a viscosity breaker in oil recovery, but this breaker is a xanthanase for degrading zanthan-based rather than guar-based fracturing fluids, and is only said to be active at 55&deg; C. (156.6&deg; F.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,370 to Tjon-Joe-Pin discloses enzyme breakers for galactomannan-based fracturing fluids, which enzyme breakers are galactomannases that hydrolyze the 1,6-&agr;-D-galactomannosidic and the 1,4-&bgr;-D-mannosidic linkages in the guar polymer, but these are said to only be active at low to moderate temperatures of about 50&deg; F. to 180&deg; F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,250,044 to Hinkel concerns a tertiary amine/persulfate breaker system, and not an enzyme system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, there is a continued need for thermostable enzyme breakers useful for fracturing subterranean formations in the course of oil and gas well stimulation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention is a method of fracturing a subterranean formation which surrounds a well bore. The method comprises the steps of providing a fracturing fluid, and injecting the fracturing fluid into the well bore at a pressure sufficient to form fractures in the subterranean formation which surrounds the well bore. The pressure is then released from the fracturing fluid, after which the fluid may be removed from the well and the well placed into production. The fracturing fluid comprises an aqueous liquid, a polysaccharide soluble or dispersible in the aqueous liquid in an amount sufficient to increase the viscosity of the aqueous liquid, an enzyme breaker which degrades said polysaccharide at a temperature above 180&deg; F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A second aspect of the present invention is a hydraulic fracturing fluid useful for fracturing a subterranean formation which surrounds a well bore. The fracturing fluid comprises an aqueous liquid; a polysaccharide soluble or dispersible in the aqueous liquid in an amount sufficient to increase the viscosity of said aqueous liquid (said polysaccharide typically included in said aqueous liquid in an amount of from about 0.1 to 1 percent by weight); and an enzyme breaker which degrades said polysaccharide at a temperature between 180&deg; F. and 280&deg; F., the enzyme breaker included in an amount effective to degrade the polysaccharide at that temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A third aspect of the present invention is an enzyme breaker useful for preparing hydraulic fracturing fluids for fracturing a subterranean formation which surrounds a well bore. The enzyme breaker comprises in combination, a mannanase which degrades polysaccharide at a temperature above 180&deg; F. and an &agr;-galactosidase which degrades polysaccharide at a temperature above 180&deg; F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A fourth aspect of the present invention is a heat-stable &agr;-galactosidase composition which hydrolyzes &agr;-1,6 hemicellulolytic linkages in galactomannans, is isolated from hyperthermophilic organisms (e.g., as a cell-free extract thereof), is active at a temperature above 180&deg; F., and is essentially inactive at a temperature of 100&deg; F. or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition to making available enzyme breakers for higher temperature wells, a still further advantage or the present invention is that, by employing enzyme breakers which are essentially inactive at the temperature at which the fracturing fluid is initially provided, the problem of premature breaking of the fracturing fluid is inhibited or reduced. As discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,922,173 to Misak at columns 1-2, premature breaking of the gelled fracturing fluid (or &ldquo;sanding out&rdquo;) can cause suspended proppant particles to settle out of the fracturing fluid before being introduced a sufficient distance into the fractures. This causes blockage of the fracture and/or an undesirable diminution of potential fracture width. The problem of premature breaking is reduced or inhibited in the present invention because the enzyme breaker is essentially inactive at the temperature at which the fracturing fluid is initially provided (e.g., usually ambient temperature, and not more than 90 or 100&deg; F). The enzyme becomes active at the elevated temperatures encountered in the subterranean formation surrounding the well bore, which is precisely the point at which enzyme activity leading to a breaking of the fracturing fluid viscosity is desired. Thus, the present invention advantageously provides a temperature control means for a controlling the timing of activation of the enzyme breaker. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Fracturing fluids used to carry out the present invention are, in general, prepared from an aqueous base fluid such as water, brine, aqueous foams or water-alcohol mixtures. Any suitable mixing apparatus may be used to provide the fracturing fluid. The pH of the fluid is typically from about 2 to 11 or 12. The fracturing fluid includes a polysaccharide as a gelling agent, as discussed below, and typically includes other ingredients such as proppant particles and crosslinking agents to crosslink the polysaccharide gelling agent, also discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Polysaccharides soluble or dispersible in an aqueous liquid include industrial gums such as those generally classified as exudate gums, seaweed gums, seed gums, microbial polysaccharides, and hemicelluloses (cell wall polysaccharides found in land plants) other than cellulose and pectins. Examples include xylan, mannan, galactan, L-arabino-xylans, L-arabino-D-glucurono-D-xylans, D-gluco-D-mannans, D-Galacto-D-mannans, arabino-D-galactans, algins such as sodium alginate, carrageenin, fucordan, laminarin, agar, gum arabic, gum ghatti, karaya gum, tamarind gum, tragacanth gum, locust bean gum, cellulose derivative such as hydroxyethylcellulose or hydroxypropylcellulose, and the like. Particularly preferred are the hydratable polysaccharides having galactose and/or mannose monosaccharide components, examples of which include the galactomannan gums, guar gum and derivatized guar gum. Examples of particularly preferred thickening agents are guar gum, hydroxypropyl guar, and carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The amount of polysaccharide included in the fracturing fluid is not particularly critical, so long as the viscosity of the fluid is sufficiently high to keep the proppant particles suspended therein during the injecting step. Thus, depending upon the application, the polysaccharide is included in the fracturing fluid in an amount of from about 10 to 150 pounds of polysaccharide per 1000 gallons of aqueous liquid, and more preferably in an amount of from about 20 to 100 pounds of polysaccharide per 1000 gallons of aqueous solution (about 2.4 to 12 kg/m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Any crosslinking agent may be used to carry out the present invention. Examples include metal ions including aluminum, antimony, zirconium an titanium containing compounds including organotitantates (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,514,309). Borate crosslinking agents or borate ion donating materials, are currently preferred. Examples of these include the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal borates and boric acid, such as sodium borate decahydrate. The crosslinking agent is typically included in an amount in the range of from about 0.0245 to 0.18% by weight of the aqueous fluid or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Proppant particles or propping agents are typically added to the base fluid prior to the addition of the crosslinking agent. Propping agents include, for example, quart sand grains, glass and ceramic beads, walnut shell fragments, alluminum pellets, nylon pellets, and the like. The propping agents are typically included in an amount of from 1 to 8 or even 18 pounds per gallon of fracturing fluid composition. Particle size of the proppant particles is typically in the range of about 200 to about 2 mesh on the U.S. Sieve Series scale. The base fluid may also contain other conventional fracturing fluid additives, such as buffers, surfactants, antioxidants, corrosion inhibitors, bactericides, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Enzyme breaker compositions useful for carrying out the present invention may be provided in any suitable physical form, such as concentrated or dilute aqueous solutions, lyophylized powders, etc. The compositions contain an enzyme effective for degrading the particular crosslinking polysaccharide employed as the gelling agent. The compositions typically include a &bgr;-Mannanase which degrades &bgr;-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> hemicellulolytic linkages in galactomannan compounds such as guar gums at a temperature above 180&deg; F., and/or an &agr;-galactosidase which degrades &agr;-1,6 hemicellulolytic linkages in galactomannan compounds such as guar gums at a temperature above 180&deg; F. Typically, the enzyme breaker composition and one or more of the enzymes therein are at least capable of degrading the polysaccharide at temperatures of from 180&deg; F. to 212&deg; F. Preferably, as discussed above, the enzyme breaker and one or more of the enzymes therein are also essentially incapable of degrading the polysaccharide at a temperature of 90 or 100&deg; F. or less (e.g., have relative activity of 0.1 or even 0.05 of optimum activity (1.0) at these temperatures). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Enzymes useful for preparing enzyme breaker compositions used in the present invention may be obtained from hyperthermophilic microorganisms Hyperthermophilic microorganisms are microorganisms which grow at temperatures higher than 90&deg; C., and have an optimal growth temperature higher than 80&deg; C. Generally, hyperthermophilic organisms are either hyperthermophilic bacteria or hyperthermophilic Archaea (as categorized according to C. Woese et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>87, 4576-4579 (1990)). These organisms are found in, for example, the Thermoproteales, Sulfolobales, Pyrodictiales, Thermococcales, Archaeoglobales, Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales, Methanopyrales, Thermotogales, and Aquificales groups. Typically these organisms are found in the genera Aquifex, Archaeoglobus, Thermotoga, Thermoproteus, Staphylothermus, Desulfurococcus, Thermofilum, Pyrobaculum, Acidianus, Desulfurolobus, Pyrodictium, Thermodiscus, Pyrococcus, Thermococcus, Hyperthermus, Methanococcus, Methanothermus, and Methanopyrus. See, e.g., Biocatalysis at Extreme Temperatures, pgs. 4-22 (M. Adams and R. Kelly Eds. 1992) (ACS Symposium Series 498). The genera Thermotoga, Thermococcus, and Pyrococcus are particularly convenient sources of organisms useful for carrying out the present invention. Specific organisms from which enzymes useful in carrying out the present invention may be obtained include, but are not limited to, <highlight><italic>Pyrococcus furiosus, Pyrococcus furiosus </italic></highlight>GBD, <highlight><italic>Thermotoga maritima, Thermus aquaticus, Thermus thermophilous, Thermococcus litoralis, </italic></highlight>ES-1, ES-4, etc. The enzymes are identified in bacteria supernatant or lysed cell extracts by conventional techniques, such as by isolating and culturing the organisms on media which contain the appropriate growth substrates (e.g., for &agr;-D-galactosidase activity on the substrate p-Nitrophenyl-&agr;-D-Galactopyranoside; for &bgr;-D-mannanase activity on the substrate p-Nitrophenyl-&bgr;-D-Mannopyranoside), DNA screening with consensus oligonucleotide probes, &ldquo;shotgun&rdquo; cloning and screening of transformed host cells with antibodies and/or gel plate assays (e.g., plates containing the growth substrates given above), etc. The enzymes may be produced by any suitable means, including either conventional fermentation in a high temperature fermentor or by genetic engineering techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be carried out on subterranean formations which surround any type of well bore, including both oil and gas well bores, with the fracturing fluid being provided and injected and pressure released, etc., all in accordance with procedures well known to those skilled in the art. As noted above, the invention is particularly advantageously employed when the subterranean formation surrounding the well bore to be fractured has a temperature greater than 180&deg; F., up to 280&deg; F. or more (it being understood that other subterranean formations which surround the well bore, which may or may not be integral with the subterranean formation having the aforesaid temperature may or may not be fractured and may or may not have the aforesaid temperature range). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the step of providing the fracturing fluid (e.g. preparing and mixing the fluid on-site) is carried out at a temperature of 90 or 100&deg; F. or less, the fracturing fluid thereby being maintained at a temperature of 90 to 100&deg; F. or less prior to the injecting step. This serves to reduce premature breaking of the crosslinked polysaccharide and sanding out of the fracturing fluid, as discussed above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> First, inocula were grown in closed bottles (125 ml) under anaerobic conditions.

<heading lvl="1">Detection of Enzyme Activity </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> &agr;-Galactosidase and &bgr;-mannanase activities were determined by using p-nitrophenyl-&agr;-D-galactopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-&bgr;-D-mannopyranoside respectively as substrates. Spectrophotometric readings were taken with a Lamda 3 spectrophotometer (The Perkin-Elmer Corp., Conn.) with a thermostated six cell transport. A liquid-circulating temperature bath (VWR Scientific model 1130) containing a 1:1 mixture of ethylene glycol and water was used to maintain the desired temperature in the cell holder. This temperature was monitored with a thermocouple mounted in a cuvette that was placed in the cell transport. The six-cell transport was controlled and data were collected and analyzed by Perkin-Elmer software run on a microcomputer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Routine enzymatic assays for &agr;-galactosidase and &bgr;-mannanase were conducted as follows. For each assay, 1.1 ml portions of substrate consisting 10 mM of substrate in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were pipetted into quartz cuvettes. The cuvettes were inserted into the cell holder, which was heated at the desired temperature, and preincubated for at least 10 minutes to allow the substrate to reach assay temperature. After the preincubation, 0.1 ml of sample was added to the cuvettes and the formation of the p-nitrophenyl (PNP) was followed by monitoring the optical density at 405 nm. A blank containing the same amount of sample in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was also monitored to correct for interferences. At temperatures below 100&deg; C. and for a short period of time (less than 15 minutes) no nonenzymatic release of PNP was noticed. One unit of &agr;-galactosidase or &bgr;-mannanase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 nmol of PNP per minute under the specified assay conditions. </paragraph>

The guar solution is prepared by using a blender set at low speed to provide a shallow vortex of water. The guar is sprinkled slowly onto the free surface to produce a uniform dispersion. KCl, glutaraldehyde and sodium thiosulfate are added quickly. The total mixing time is about two minutes. The glutaraldehyde is used as a bactericide, and the sodium thiosulfate serves as an antioxidant. The samples are then mixed for 20 hours using a horizontal shaker.

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Improved methods for generating a &mdash;C&mdash;C&mdash; bond by cross-coupling of a transferable group with an acceptor group. The transferable group is a substituent of an organosilicon nucleophile and the acceptor group is provided as an organic electrophile.

Certain methods of this invention use improved organosilicon nucleophiles which are readily prepared, can give high product yields and exhibit high stereo selectivity. Methods of this invention employ activating ions such as halides, hydroxide, hydride and silyloxides. In specific embodiments, organosilicon nucleophilic reagents of this invention include siloxanes, particularly cyclic siloxanes.

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This fundamental transformation has been demonstrated to occur with a variety of organometallic nucleophiles and organic electrophiles typically catalyzed by Ni or Pd. The Suzuki coupling of organoboranes (3) and the Stille (Migita-Kosugi) coupling of organostannanes (4), for example, employ stable, isolable reagents that are extremely weak nucleophiles with good functional group compatibility. Cross-coupling reactions (1, 2) can be used, for example, to construct biaryl subunits which are a commonly found in biologically active molecules (5). Biaryl-containing compounds are also useful in the design of new compounds including organic semiconductors and liquid crystals (6). Existing methods and reagents for metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, however, have some disadvantages, including attenuated and substrate-dependent reactivity, oxygen-sensitivity, high molecule weight and toxicity, which limit their utility and scope of application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There is continuing interest in the development of new cross-coupling reactions that employ milder procedures and have broader structural generality. Desirable aspects of improved cross-coupling reactions include:(1) increased ease of preparation of the reagents (2) mildness of reaction conditions (3) stereospecificity of reaction (4) functional group compatibility and (5) tractability of by-products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The Hiyama group (7-11, 13) has reported that functionalized organosilanes: aryl and/or alkenylfluorosilanes (7-11), -fluorosiliconates (10a) and -orthosiliconates (10b; 12), do engage in cross-coupling reactions. However, these reagents are difficult to synthesize in geometrically defined form, are difficult to purify and require somewhat harsh reaction conditions for cross-coupling. Silanols (13) have also been demonstrated as appropriate coupling partners. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Ideally an organosilicon reagent for use in a cross-coupling reaction will have low molecular weight, be highly effective for cross-coupling, easy to synthesize, stable under chromatographic purification conditions, easily activated toward organic electrophiles, particularly organic halides, converted to harmless (or at least less toxic) by-products. It is further desirable that the organosilicon reagent be compatible with a variety of functional groups and exhibit stereoselectivity in reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides methods for metal-catalyzed cross-coupling and improved organometallic nucleophiles for use in such reactions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides improved methods for generating a &mdash;C&mdash;C&mdash; bond by cross-coupling of a transferable group with an acceptor group. The transferable group is a substituent of an organosilicon nucleophile and the acceptor group is provided as an organic electrophile. The reaction is catalyzed by a Group 10 transition metal complex (e.g., Ni, Pt or Pd), particularly by a palladium complex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A first important aspect of this invention is the use of improved organosilicon nucleophiles which are readily prepared, and can give high product yields and exhibit high stereospecificity. A further important aspect of the invention is the activation of the organosilicon nucleophile by addition of an activation agent that provides an activating anion (e.g., a halide ion, hydroxide ion, hydride etc.). The activated organosilicon nucleophile is then reacted with the acceptor group in the presence of the palladium complex to generate the cross-coupling product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Activation of the organosilicon nucleophile prior to contact with the acceptor group significantly decreases the formation of undesired side-products that may result from reduction of the organic electrophile. It has also been found that the amount and type of activating agent can affect the rate of the reaction. It is believed that preferred activator anions (e.g., F<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> and OH<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) should be capable of acting as bases to assist in the association with the metal (e.g., palladium) intermediate, but should also be capable of acting as nucleophiles to further promote the transmetallation by forming siliconate complexes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the invention provides improved cross-coupling reactions employing the organosilicon nucleophile of formula I wherein the silicon donor reacts with an organic electrophile (R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&mdash;Y) in the presence of a palladium catalyst (M&mdash;Ln, where Ln

The reaction is performed in the presence of an activating agent, the salt A<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>Z<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The organosilicon nucleophile can contain more than one transferable group, spectator (non-transferred) groups (e.g., R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>or R<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) and other functional groups X, which may be covalently linked to each other as indicated by dashed lines in formula I . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the organo silicon nucleophile is activated with the activating agent prior to reaction with the organic electrophile. The reaction is typically carried out in an appropriate solvent including, among others, polar aprotic solvents, for example, ethers, THF (tetrahydrofuran), DMF (dimethylformamide), CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CN, TBME (t-butylmethylether) or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The transferable group (T) can be selected from aromatic (including aryl and substituted aryl), substituted aromatic, heteroaromatic, olefinic, substituted olefinic, allylic, substituted allylic, acetylenic, substituted acetylenic, allenic, substituted allemic, an acyl group, an alkyl including: cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl groups, and substituted alkyl groups, including perfluoralkyl groups. T groups can also contain one or more substituents (Rs) that are protected from reaction during the cross-coupling reaction by an appropriate protective group, as is understood in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> T groups specifically include, cyclopropyl groups, epoxy groups, vinyl groups, propenyl groups, butenyl groups, pentenyl groups, hexenyl groups, heptenyl groups, acetylenic groups, propargyl groups, aryl-substituted alkenyl groups, phenyl groups, naphthyl groups, thienyl, pyridinyl groups or acyl groups. All T groups can be substituted with one or more non-hydrogen substituenets (Rs), which can include among others halides, CN, and NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>is an acceptor group to which T will be coupled and which can be an aromatic, substituted aromatic, heteroaromatic, olefinic, substituted olefinic, allylic, substituted allylic, acetylenic, substituted acetylenic, allenic, substituted allenic, alkyl, and substituted alkyl groups. Y is any leaving group that will not otherwise interfere with the reaction, including among others: I, Br, Cl, OTf (triflate), OTs (tosyl), nonaflate, phosphates, iodonium ions, or N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>. Preferred leaving groups are I and Br. The acceptor group can carry one or more non-hydrogen substituents (Rs) which can include electron withdrawing groups and electron donating groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> M&mdash;Ln is a Group 10 metal complex, where Ln can represent the presence of one or more ligands. Preferred metal complexes are palladium complexes which can have 2-4 ligands/Pd. The catalyst can contain more than one palladium and have ligands bridging the palladiums. Ln can be organic groups or halides or mixtures of organic groups and halides. Palladium catalyst include, among others, Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; Pd<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(dba)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&bull;solvent; &lsqb;Pd(allyl)Cl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; PdCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; Pd(OAc)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; Pd(OTFA)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; (Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Pd; (Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PdCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; (COD)PdBr<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; Pd(OTf)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; (PhCN)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PdCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; and (Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PdBrCl. Preferred Pd catalysts are Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; Pd<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(dba)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&bull; solvent; and &lsqb;Pd(allyl)Cl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(dba is dibenzylidene acetone, OAc is acetate, OTFA is trifluoracetate, Ph is phenyl, COD is 1,4-cyclooctadiene, and OTf is triflate.) M&mdash;Ln can be prepared and added to a reaction or prepared in situ by separate addition of a stable organic source of the metal, e.g. a stable organic source of palladium, and a selected ligand or mixture of ligands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The activity of a given catalyst for the cross-coupling reaction of this invention may in some cases be enhanced by addition of an additive, such as CuI or other additives that have been shown to enhance coupling reactions such as the Stille Coupling reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The activating agent A<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>Z<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> for activating the organosilicon nucleophile is an anion source. Preferred anions are those that can function as a base as well as a nucleophile. Anions include F<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, OH<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, CN<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, HF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, RO<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, where R is an alkyl or aromatic (including an aryl) group, (R)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> where the Rs in the same anion can be the same or different and are alkyl groups or aromatic (including aryl) groups, e.g., (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, (Ph)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>; and (R)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Si&mdash;O<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>, where Rs in the same anion can be the same or different and can be alkyl or aromatic (including aryl) groups. Anions can be provided as salts with any appropriate cation. Cations include K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Cs<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, (R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>N)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> (where R is aliphatic). The cation is typically selected to facilitate solubility of the activating agent in the selected reaction solvent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a specific embodiment, the cross&mdash;coupling reaction is performed free of fluoride ion. In this embodiment, the preferred activating agent is a base such as hydride (H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>) or a silanolate anion ((R)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;Si&mdash;O<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>). Fluorine&mdash;free cross&mdash;coupling is preferred for use with coupling substrates (T or R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&mdash;Y) which contain silyl protective groups. The use of activating anions that are not fluorine expands the utility of the cross&mdash;coupling reaction to allow the use of silyl protective groups. The preferred organosilicon nucleophiles for use in fluoride&mdash;free cross-coupling are organosilanols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for generating biaryl moieties in the cross&mdash;coupling reaction. In this case, T and R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>are aryl groups or substituted aryl groups. In another specific embodiment, the invention provides a method for generating dienes in the cross-coupling reaction. In this case, T and R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>are olefinic groups or substituted olefinic groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The cross-coupling reaction of this invention is compatible with a number of other reactions which can be used to form organosilicon nucleophiles that can then participate in the cross-coupling reaction. In certain cases, the reagents for the cross-coupling reaction can be combined with those for generating the organosilicon nucleophile, so that a one&mdash;pot protocol can be employed to generated desired cross-coupling products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> For example, the formal addition of an aryl-H or alkenyl-H bond across a terminal alkyne can be accomplished in a single reaction vessel by combination of a platinum-catalyzed hydrosilyation followed by the cross-coupling reaction of this invention. Highly stereoselective conversion of homopropargyl alchols to trisubstituted homoallylic alcohols can be achieved in a one-pot reaction by coupling of alkylidenesilacycloakanes formed from intramolecular hydrosilyation of homopropargyl alcohols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The cross-coupling reaction of this invention can be combined with ring-closing metathesis of silylvinyl ethers to generate unsaturated alcohols (e.g., diene alcohols or styrene alcohols). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides improved organosilicon reagents for use in metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. The reagents are alkenyl- or aryl-substituted silanes or siloxanes which are highly effective for cross-coupling, compatible with a wide range of functional groups, and which provide generally high reaction yields and stereoselectiveness. </paragraph>

Olefinic groups include, among others: R<highlight><superscript>A</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>B</superscript></highlight>&mdash;C&boxH;C&mdash;R<highlight><superscript>C</superscript></highlight>&mdash; where R<highlight><superscript>A-C </superscript></highlight>can be various aliphatic, or aromatic groups with various substituents. For example, olefinic groups include R<highlight><superscript>A</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>B</superscript></highlight>&mdash;C&boxH;C&mdash;R<highlight><superscript>C</superscript></highlight>&mdash;, where R<highlight><superscript>A-C </superscript></highlight>independently, can be hydrogen, alkyl or aryl groups (which may be substituted) and particularly, include those where R<highlight><superscript>A </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>B </superscript></highlight>are alkyl or aryl groups (which may be substituted) and R<highlight><superscript>C </superscript></highlight>is hydrogen. Alkenyl groups can include linear alkenes, branched alkenes or cyclic alkenes (e.g., cyclohexenyl). The term &ldquo;diene&rdquo; refers to groups that have two double bonds which may be conjugated (e.g., &mdash;HC&boxH;CH&mdash;CH&boxH;CH&mdash;) or non-conjugated (e.g., &mdash;CH&boxH;CH&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CH&boxH;CH&mdash;). The term &ldquo;polyenes&rdquo; refers generally to any group that contains more than one double bond. Allylic species are groups having the structure R<highlight><superscript>A</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>B</superscript></highlight>&mdash;C&boxH;C&mdash;R<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CR<highlight><superscript>D</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>E</superscript></highlight>&mdash;, where R<highlight><superscript>A-E </superscript></highlight>can be various aliphatic, or aromatic groups with various substituents. Allylic species include R<highlight><superscript>A</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>B</superscript></highlight>C&boxH;CR<highlight><superscript>C</superscript></highlight>CR<highlight><superscript>D</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>E</superscript></highlight>&mdash;, where R<highlight><superscript>A-E</superscript></highlight>, independently, are hydrogen, alkyl or aryl groups and particularly include groups where R<highlight><superscript>A </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>B </superscript></highlight>are alkyl or aryl groups and R<highlight><superscript>C-E </superscript></highlight>are hydrogens. Allenic species are groups having the structure: R<highlight><superscript>A</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>B</superscript></highlight>&mdash;C&boxH;C&boxH;C&mdash;R<highlight><superscript>C</superscript></highlight>&mdash;, where R<highlight><subscript>A-C </subscript></highlight>can be various aliphatic or aromatic groups that may be substituted. Allenic groups include R<highlight><superscript>A</superscript></highlight>R<highlight><superscript>B</superscript></highlight>&mdash;C&boxH;C&boxH;C&mdash;R<highlight><superscript>C</superscript></highlight>&mdash;, where R<highlight><superscript>A-C</superscript></highlight>, independently, are hydrogen, alkyl or aryl groups and particularly the groups where R<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>B </superscript></highlight>are alkyl or aryl groups and R<highlight><subscript>C-E </subscript></highlight>are hydrogens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The term alkynyl is used broadly herein to refer to organic groups having one or more triple bonds, which may or may not be conjugated. The term acetylenic refers to groups having the structure R<highlight><superscript>A</superscript></highlight>&mdash;C&equiv;C&mdash; where R<highlight><superscript>A </superscript></highlight>can be a variety of alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl groups. A terminal alkyne has the structure R<highlight><superscript>A</superscript></highlight>&mdash;C E&equiv;CH&mdash; where R<highlight><superscript>A </superscript></highlight>can be various aliphatic or aromatic groups that may be substituted with one or more non-hydrogen substituents (Rs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The term substituent as used in reference to various groups (e.g., substituted alkyl or substituted aromatic) is used broadly herein to refer to the introduction of various non-hydrogen substituents (generally Rs) into the named group. A substituent can replace a H in a given named group, it may replace a &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash; group in a straight-chain, branched or cyclic alkyl moiety, or it may replace a ring carbon in an aromatic or aryl compound. Preferred substituents include halides, CN&mdash;, NO<highlight><subscript>2&minus;</subscript></highlight>, OH&mdash;, SH&mdash;, N(R)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>groups where R is a hydrogen, an alkyl or aryl group, or a substituted alkyl or substituted aryl group; an SR group where R is an alkyl or aryl group, or a substituted alkyl or substituted aryl group; an acyl group, or an RO&mdash;, ROCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash; or RCO&mdash; group where R is an alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl or substituted aryl group. For example, one or more non-neighboring &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash; groups in any named group may be substituted with an &mdash;O&mdash; to give an ether group), &mdash;S&mdash; (to give a thioether group), NH or NR (where R is alkyl)(to give an amine group), &mdash;NH&mdash;CO&mdash; (to give an amide group), C&boxH;O (to give a ketone group), and &mdash;O&mdash;C&boxH;O (to give an ester group). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Substituents are preferably non-reactive under the cross-coupling reaction conditions applied. However, reactive substituents can be accommodated if protected with protecting groups, as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The reactions of this invention are conducted in a solvent. The solvent is preferably chosen to provide a substantially homogeneous reaction mixture to maintain reactants, activator and catalyst substantially in solution to facilitate reaction. Preferred solvents are polar aprotic solvents, including ethers, DMF, THF, CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CN, TBME and mixtures thereof, which facilitate the cross-coupling reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Cross-coupling reaction can generally be carried out at temperatures ranging from sub-ambient to ambient to the temperature of refluxing solvent. It is preferred that the reaction be carried out at the lowest temperature possible without cooling (most preferably at ambient room temperature) to minimize energy costs of reaction and to avoid unnecessary decomposition of reactants, catalyst or activator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As illustrated herein, reaction rates and yield of the desired product can be affected by the relative amounts of reagents and activator present in the reaction mixture. In general, in the cross-coupling reactions of this invention, the organosilicon nucleophile is preferably provided in excess (in molar equivalents) over the organic electrophile. The organosilicon nucleophile is preferably employed at more than 1 up to about 2 equivalents. A more preferred range for the organosilicon nucleophile is from about 1 to about 1.5 equivalents and a more preferred range is from about 1.1 to about 1.2 equivalents. The activator, also in general, is preferably provided in excess over the organosilicon nucleophile, at a level of at least about 5% or more equivalents of the organosilicon nucleophile. As discussed below, it was found that the desired coupling reaction was significantly facilitated by the use of a larger excess of the activator. Thus, in preferred embodiments the activator is present in the reaction mixture at levels of 2 to 3 times (in equivalents) of that of the organosilicon nucleophile. A preferred range for the activator is from about 2 to about 4.5 equivalents (based on the organic electrophile). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Reaction products can generally be isolated and purified by methods well-known in the art. It was found that the desired coupling reaction products, which were, in general, rather nonpolar, could be removed from siloxane by-products by initial silica gel plug filtration of the reaction mixture, followed by reversed-phase chromatography which was followed by distillation. Coupling reaction products that are solids may be further purified by recrystalization or other methods known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Organosilicon nucleophiles of this invention can be readily prepared by methods illustrated herein or by routine modification or adaptation of those methods in view of what is generally known in the art and what is specifically described herein. A variety of organosilicon compounds suitable for use as nucleophiles in this invention are commercially available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A variety of organic electrophiles, catalysts, particularly Pd catalysts, ligands, and activator salts useful in the reactions of this invention are commercially available or readily synthesized using methods disclosed herein or that are well-known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As illustrated herein, reaction conditions can be readily optimized for a given organosilicon nucleophile, organic electrophile, activator, or catalyst in view of the teachings herein and what is generally known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides reagent kits which combine an organosilicon nucleophile of this invention with an activating agent and optionally also a catalyst. The kit may contain components in relative amounts optimal for carrying out a selected coupling reaction with the organosilicon reagent provided in the kit. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Alkenylsilacycloalkanes </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The methods of this invention that employ alkenylsilacycloakanes are illustrated by examining the coupling of (E)- and (Z)-1-(1-heptenyl)-1-methysilacyclobutane ((E)-21 and (Z)-21) with a variety of electrophiles. These substrates are readily prepared in high yield and geometrical purity (with the E/Z ratios determined by GC analysis, see below) as shown in Scheme 2. Because of the enhanced electrophilicity of 1-chloro-1-methylsilacyclobutane, the intermediate vinylalane obtained by hydroalumination of 1-heptyne reacted in good yield to afford (E)-21 in &gt;99/1 isomeric purity. The corresponding (Z)-21 isomer was prepared by adaptation of related literature procedures (14). Although 1-chloro-1-methylsilacyclobutane is commercially available (Gelest Inc. or Aldrich), it can be prepared in large quantities by Wurtz coupling of dichloro(3-chloropropyl)methylsilane (15, 16). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> First, a survey of many palladium catalysts showed a dramatic influence on reaction rate in the following order: Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&tilde;Pd<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;(dba)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&gt;&lsqb;allylPdCl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&gt;Pd(OAc)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&tilde;Pd(OTf)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&gt;(COD)PdBr<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&gt;(PhCN)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PdCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&tilde;(Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PdCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&tilde;(Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>BnPdCl for alkenyl iodides. The order may be different for other reactants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Second, the nature and amount of the fluoride source was also found to be important. TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride) was found to be effective with the alkenylsilacycloalkanes; however, neither (Me<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>N)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>S<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Me<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SiF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>(TASF) nor KF gave coupling products in the reactions examined with these reagents. The corresponding TBA-OR (where R is alkyl, e.g., methyl) or related tetraalkylammonium fluorides or alkoxides can also be used with these nucleophiles. Also, the reactions displayed a strange rate profile. With 1.5 equiv of TBAF, initial rates were fast (nearly 80% conversion in 10 min, but the reactions required another 8-9 h to go to completion (<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR analysis). Thus, by simply employing additional TBAF (e.g., 3 equiv.), the reactions proceeded rapidly to completion within minutes. In view of the teachings herein, the amount of activating agent (e.g., TBAF, TMAF (tetramethylammonium fluoride) or tetraalkylammonium hydroxide or -alkoxide) can be readily optimized for a given cross-coupling reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Finally, the order of mixing of the reagents is important for achieving high yields and reproducible reactions. Specifically, premixing of the silacyclobutane and activating agent eliminated the formation of reduction by-products with many of the Pd catalysts. Thus, specifically for the silacyclobutane reagents, the preferred reaction protocol employs 1.1-1.2 equiv of 21, 3.0 equiv of TBAF (1.0 M in THF as solvent), and 5 mol % Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The reactions are preferably run at ambient (RT) temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Stereoselectivity and synthetic generality of the process were investigated in coupling reactions of (E)- and (Z)-21 with aryl iodides (Table 1). For all substrates examined, the reactions were highly stereospecific (see E/Z ratio). Moreover, both electron-deficient (entries 7 and 8) arenes and electron rich (entries 9 and 10) arenes reacted rapidly and in high yield. To achieve such high yields of analytically pure materials, a purification protocol was needed to remove the siloxane by-products from the rather non-polar coupling products. Thus, the styrenes 22a-22e (where the identifiy of the Aryl group is listed in Table 1) were all purified by silica gel plug filtration, C-18 reversed-phase chromatography (MeOH/H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O), and distillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Alkenyl halides are excellent partners in sp<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/sp<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>couplings with 21. The results of Pd-catalyzed coupling with alkenyl iodides and bromides under identical reaction conditions to give dienes 24 and 26 (minor amounts) are collected in Table 2. As in the alkenyl/aryl couplings these reactions were also highly stereospecific even for the production of (Z,Z)-24c (entry 7). The reactions proceeded smoothly at room temperature, though for &bgr;-bromostyrene, &lsqb;allylPdCl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gave the best results. Moreover, the free OH<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> group in (E)- or (Z)-6-iodo-5-hexenol did not interfere with the coupling. In all cases a minor byproduct of cine substitution 26 was detected which presumably arose from a Heck type process previously documented in organoborane (3)/organostannane couplings (17). However, with &agr;-bromostyrene (E)-28, (E)-21coupled in high yield to give (E)-30 and without a trace of the regioisomer (Scheme 3). </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Arylsilacycloalkanes </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Initial studies of the cross-coupling reaction of methyl-(phenyl)silacyclobutane with either aryl or alkenyl iodides gave no desired products under various conditions, including those optimized for alkenylsilacyclobutanes. The reactivity of the arylsilacyclobutanes was enhanced by introducing a heteroatom on the silicon. Chlorosilane 40 and fluorosilane 42 were prepared in a straightforward fashion from dichlorosilacyclobutane (38) (available from Aldrich or Gelest Inc.), Scheme 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Orienting experiments with 42 and iodobenzene revealed that under standard coupling conditions (TBAAF/Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/THF/RT, see 18) 25% conversion could be obtained in 48 hours. Screening different Pd sources identified &lsqb;allylPdCl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as the superior catalyst in terms of rate and amount of side reaction. With this catalyst, fluorosilane 42 was found to be more reactive than chlorosilane 40 and thus was used to optimize the other reaction variables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Careful investigation of the reaction between 42 and iodobenzene showed that homocoupling of both these substrates (to generate 45 or 46, for example) was a serious liability (entry 1, Table 3) (11,19). Where no ligand was added both possible homocoupling products 45 and 46 were observed. To facilitate the transmetallation and eliminate the cross-coupling, various additives were surveyed with ratio of ligand/palladium of 2.0. The additives examined (Table 3) cover a wide range of donor properties and steric bulk. While (o-tol)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P (entry 2), (C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P (entry 3), and phosphite 48 (entry 9) suppressed the desired coupling, the other ligands such as tri(2-furyl)-phosphine (entry 4) and triphenylarsine (entry 5) and the bulky ligands such as tri(tert-butyl)phosphine (entry 6) (20) and tricyclohexylphosphine (entry 7) were effective in eliminating the homocoupling of arylsilanes and significantly suppressing the homocoupling of aryl iodides. Nevertheless, the desired cross-coupling was still rather sluggish. It was surprising that recently introduced ligand 47 (entry 8) did not inhibit the generation of 45 (21). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> To accelerate the cross-coupling process, the reaction temperature was increased to 50&deg; C. Again, a variety of ligands were surveyed, and the results are collected in Table 4. With the exception of P(C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>F<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(entry 2) and DMPE (entry 5), all the other ligands allowed the reaction to be complete in 24 hours. As is evident from Table 5, the ligands have a dramatic effect on the generation of homocoupling product 45. Tri(tert-butyl)phosphine was the best ligand to suppress this side reaction; only 6% of 45 was produced (Table 4, entry 7). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To further reduce the amount of 45, the ligand/Pd ratio was examined with most effective additive tri(tert-butyl)phosphine. As is apparent from Table 5, the more ligand added, the less 45 generated. However, the desired cross-coupling reaction was also retarded by the ligand. When the ligand/Pd ratio was over about 4.2, the reaction was not complete in 22 hours. Thus, the preferred ratio of (tert-Bu)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P/Pd is about 2.0 for the coupling of fluorosilane 42 with aryl iodides at 50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Preliminary studies found fluorosilane 42 to be superior to chlorosilacyclobutane 40 in the cross-coupling reaction. Under the identical conditions noted above in Table 6 (THF/50&deg; C.), the reaction with the chlorosilacyclobutane 40 was not complete within 22 hours. By carrying out the reaction in refluxing THF, complete conversion could be observed within 16 hours (Table 6). However, at the elevated temperature, the amount of side product 45 increased to 11% with a (t-Bu)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P/Pd ratio of 2.2. The amount of 45 can be reduced to less than 5% when the ratio of P(t-Bu)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/Pd is increased to 4.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing studies it is apparent that both chlorosilane 40 and fluorosilane 42 are appropriate partners for the cross-coupling with aryl iodides. The fluorosilane is more reactive and can perform the coupling at slightly lower temperature and with less additive. On the other hand, the chlorosilane can be easily prepared in one step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Optimized conditions were established as follows for reaction of the chlorosilane 40: pre-treatment of 40 with TBAF (3.0 equiv), &lsqb;allylPdCl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(2.5 mol %) as catalyst, and tri(tert-butyl)phosphine (20 mol %) as ligand in refluxing THF. The reactions with a variety of aryl iodides bearing electron-withdrawing or -donating groups in the para, meta, or ortho positions were investigated to show the generality of the electrophilic component (Table 7). The desired unsymmetrical biaryls were obtained in good to excellent yields within several hours for all the aryl iodides tested. The mild reaction conditions are compatible with a wide range of functional groups including carbethoxy (entry 2), acetyl (entry 3), nitro (entry 4), and cyano (entry 5). It is noteworthy that even though the coupling is slightly slowed by ortho substituents, the reaction still goes to completion within three hours for both 2-nitrophenyl iodide (entry 11) and 2-methylphenyl iodide (entry 10). Also, heteroaromatic iodides such as 3-iodopyridine (entry 12) are well-suited for the cross-coupling reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> To investigate the effect of ortho substitution at the arylsilane, aryl(chloro)silacyclobutane 49 was synthesized and its reactivity was examined with several aryl iodides (Table 8). Even though the reactions were slower than those with chlorosilane 40, all the couplings with 49 give good yields of the corresponding biaryl compounds. Remarkably, sterically crowded 2-methyl-2&prime;-nitrobiphenyl (entry 3) and 2,2&prime;-dimethylbiphenyl (entry 4) can be prepared cleanly in 77% and 85% yields, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Extensive reaction optimization revealed five important variables: (1) palladium source, (2) arylsilane, (3) additive, (4) ligand/Pd ratio, and (5) reaction temperature. The optimal conditions involve &lsqb;allylPdCl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as catalyst and (t-Bu)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P as the additive. A heteroatom substituent on the silicon of arylsilacyclobutanes is important to enhance the reactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> When fluorosilanes are employed, the reaction is preferably run at 50&deg; C. with a ligand/Pd ratio equal to about 2.0. If chlorosilanes are used, the reaction is preferably performed in refluxing THF with a ligand/Pd ratio of about 4.0. For the biaryl synthesis, these conditions are milder than the other palladium-catalyzed processes including the acyclic arylsilanes and the typical Stille and Suzuki reactions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Alkenylsilanols </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> To make direct comparisons to cross-coupling with alkenylsilacyclobutanes, the geometrically defined (1-heptenyl)dimethylsilanols (E)-50, and (Z)-50, and (1-heptenyl)di(isopropyl)silanol (E)-52 and (Z)-52 were chosen. These substrates are readily prepared following established procedures as outlined in Schemes 5 and 6 (22, 23). Treatment of (E)-1-bromo-1-heptene (24) with t-butyllithium, followed by the addition of hexamethyltrisiloxane resulted in the formation of (E)-50 in 74% yield. The corresponding Z-isomer was prepared in a similar manner from (Z)-1-iodo-1-heptene which upon treatment with n-butyllithium and hexamethyltrisiloxane afforded (Z)-50 in 68% yield. Silanols (E)- and (Z)-50 and (E)- and (Z)-52 were all obtained in geometrically pure form (&gt;99%) as established by capillary CG analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> To investigate the influence of the non-transferable groups on the silicon atom (and illustrate an alternative entry to the silanol precurors) di(isopropyl(silanols (E)-52 and (Z)-52 (Scheme 6) were prepared. Catalytic (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PtCl<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>) hydrosilylation of 1-heptyne with chlorodi(isopropyl)silane followed by alkaline hydrolysis provided (E)-52 in 78% yield (25). The stereoisomer (Z)-52, was produced by a high yielding four-step synthesis starting from (Z)-1-iodo-1-heptene. Lithium-iodide exchange with n-butyllithium, followed by the addition of chlorodi(isopropyl)silane formed the intermediate (1-heptenyl)di(isopropyl)silane in 95% yield. Oxidation with chlorine (0.9 M solution in CCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>), followed by mild hydrolysis produced (Z)-52 in 90% yield over two steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The extensive optimization of reaction conditions (palladium catalyst, fluoride source, stoichiometry, solvent and temperature) already carried out in the context of the silacyclobutane coupling was the starting point for these studies. Accordingly, the silanol was first combined with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in THE for 10 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of the organic iodide and the palladium complex (Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The reactions were generally complete within 10-30 min (Table 9) to give the corresponding products 53(a-e). These conditions differ from those employed for silacyclobutanes only in the amount of TBAF added. It was shown that only two equiv. of a freshly prepared TBAF solution were sufficient to effectively promote the cross-coupling of silanols within 10 min. Further reduction in the amount of the TBAF, however, resulted in a decrease of the reaction rate and yield (cf. entries 8 and 9 in Table 9). Activator is required however, as omission of TBAF from the reaction mixtures resulted in complete recovery of both the aryl iodide and the silanol. Although a basic/nucleophilic activator is essential, it need not be fluoride. Indeed, substitution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride with the corresponding hydroxide (as a 2.0 M solution in methanol) gave rise to comparable rate and yield for the coupling of (E)-50 with naphthyl iodide (cf. entries 3 and 5, Table 9). However, the product is accompanied by 2.5% of the cine rearrangement product when TBA-OH/methanol is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Removal of the silicon-containing byproducts and isolation of the styrenes was readily accomplished by a three step procedure, (1) filtration of the crude reaction mixture through a plug of silica gel; (2) column chromatography (silica gel or reverse phase C18); and (3) distillation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The experiments described in Table 9, clearly demonstrate that the influence of the different functional groups present on the aryl iodide is minimal. The rate and yield of the reactions are not affected by functional groups. The presence of electronically neutral (entries 1-5), electron donating (entries 12 and 13) as well as electron withdrawing (entries 8 and 9) substituents is well tolerated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Rates and yields for the cross coupling of silacyclobutanes and dimethylsilanols were similar, but the selectivities obtained with the dimethylsilanols were slightly lower than those observed with the silacyclobutanes; up to 5.5% of the geometrical isomer was observed, starting from a single, pure isomer of the (E)- and (z)-52. The results summarized in Table 1 show that the rates for the cross coupling are independent of the substituents on the silicon atom. The selectivity of the reaction is now comparable to the selectivity observed with silacyclobutane and substantially improved over the selectivity obtained with the dimethylsilanols (for example cf. Table 9, entries 1 and 2 and Table 10, entries 1 and 2). Moreover, when tetrabutylammonium hydroxide was used as the activator (cf. Table 9, entry 5 and Table 10, entry 5) no cine rearrangement produce was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> As was the case with alkenylsilacyclobutanes, silanols (E)-50 and (2)-50 undergo rapid and stereospecific cross-coupling with alkenyl iodides as well. Under conditions identical to those employed previously, the vinyl iodides (E)- and (Z)-6-iodo-5-hexenols reacted with the silanols to give conjugated dienes 54 in good yield (Table 11). The reactions were generally slower than the coupling reactions with aryl iodides. In all cases, the desired products were contaminated with a small and variable amount of an isomeric diene 55 which presumably arose from a cine rearrangement pathway (as was also observed previously). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Stereospecificity, again, is similar to that obtained with aryl iodides, some loss in configurational homogeneity of the double bond arising from the silanol is observed, whereas the double bond originating from the iodide is not affected. In entry 5, up to 10% of the stereoisomeric (E,Z)-54 was formed, although, this compound may be prone to isomerization, there is almost twice as much isomerization as with silacyclobutane. In this case a different palladium-catalyst &lsqb;allylPdCl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>had to be used, as Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was not effective, and led to even more isomerization. When the methyl groups on the starting silanols were replaced with isopropyl groups (entries 2 and 6), the selectivities are again improved with respect to the ratios observed with silacyclobutane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> There is a dramatic difference between the rate of coupling of the alkenylsilanols of this invention and those described recently by Hiyama (13). The reactions exemplified herein use different palladium sources and different activators. Hiyama employs Pd(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and silver(I) oxide in DMF solution. Phosphine ligands appear to inhibit the cross-coupling reaction. In contrast, the method of this invention with silanols uses activators which can be other basic and nucleophilic, such as F- or OH- sources, tetraalkylammonium fluoride or the corresponding hydroxide. Without wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism, it is currently believed that there is an association between the silanol (silyloxide) and the palladium center prior to and facilitating the transmetallation event (27). Both types of activators (R<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>X<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> and Ag<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) are in principle capable of acting as bases to deprotonate the silanol and, thus, assisting in the association with the palladium intermediate. However, fluoride and hydroxide differ from Ag<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, because both fluoride and hydroxide can also act as nucleophiles to further promote the transmetallation by forming siliconate complexes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Compound 61 was generated by metalation of 2H-3,4-dihydropyran with t-BuLi according to Soderquist&apos;s procedure (31) and subsequent reaction with hexameth-ylcyclotrisiloxane (32) resulted in the formation of &lsqb;2-(5,6-dihydro-4H-pyranyl)&rsqb;dimethylsilanol (61) in 68% yield. The optimization of the palladium(0)-catalyzed cross-coupling was guided by the previous studies with alkenylsilanols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, silanol 61 was first combined with a 1.0 M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF.3H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, Fluka) in THF at room temperature, followed by the addition of the aryl iodide and the palladium complex (Pd-(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The reactions were clean and generally complete within 10-20 min. However, as had been noted previously, difficulties were encountered in the purification step because (1) the polarity of the products was similar to the dba ligand and to the polysilicone byproducts and (2) the products were found to be particularly labile in air and on chromatographic media. Moreover, reverse-phase (C-18) silica chromatography was either not efficient or led to partial decomposition of the products if long gradient elutions were used. By using rapid silica gel column chromatography, the polysilicone byproducts could be separated, but the product was always contaminated with dba. By the simple expedient of replacing the Pd(dba)2 catalyst with &lsqb;allylPdCl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the cross coupling products 62 (Table 12) were obtained in an analytically pure form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The scope of the cross-coupling reaction of 61 was further investigated with aryl iodides bearing electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups in para, meta, or ortho positions (Table 12). For all aryl iodides examined, the reaction proved to be fast and high yielding. Several features of the reaction are noteworthy: (1) electron-withdrawing or-donating groups exhibit similar reactivity (entries 4 and 6), (2) the steric effect of ortho substituents is minimal (cf. entries 1 and 4-7) except in the case of the 2-carbomethoxy group (entry 3) where chelation between the carbonyl moiety and the palladium may slow the reductive elimination step, (3) the reaction tolerates diverse functionalities such as ester, nitro, cyano (vide infra), ether, and even hydroxyl. The mild reaction conditions and uniformly high yields compare favorably with other methods to produce these compounds. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The reaction rate and yield were comparable to that obtained with aryl iodides, and after 2 h, 63 could be isolated in 81% yield after Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>chromatography. The corresponding (Z)-3-iodoacrylate suffered decomposition under the reaction conditions and did not lead to coupling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Following the successful coupling of silanol 61, the use of (1-butoxyvinyl)dimethylsilanol and &lsqb;2-(4,5-dihydrofuranyl)&rsqb; dimethylsilanol were then considered. However, the sequence established for the synthesis of 61 (lithiation of the vinyl group and subsequent quenching) did not provide the silanols cleanly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Previous experience with handling silanols suggested that increasing the bulk of the silicon substituent could make the products more tractable. Since hexaisopropylcyclotrisiloxane is not commercially available, an alternative procedure that involves (1) lithiation of the vinyl ether, (2) addition to chlorodiisopropylsilane (to form the intermediate silyl hydride), (3) oxidation of the hydridosilane with chlorine to form the chlorosilane, and (4) alkaline hydrolysis to produce the silanol can be employed to prepare silanols useful in the cross-coupling reactions herein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Optimization of the Pd(0)-catalyzed coupling with siloxane 74 and 4-iodoacetophenone employed the conditions developed with alkenyl silanols. Thus, siloxane 74 was combined with a 1.0 M THE solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF.3H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) at room temperature, followed by the addition of 4-iodoacetophenone and 5 mol % of Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, sequentially. The reaction proceeded cleanly to completion in only 10 min. Decreasing the loading of Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>only marginally affected the rate of the coupling process. However, with a lower catalyst loading (1.0 mol %) or less TBAF (1.0 equiv) the reaction did not go to completion and a significant amount of 4-iodoacetophenone was recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> With suitable conditions for the cross-coupling processing in hand, the reaction was examined with various aryl iodides. Scheme B illustrates the reaction of cyclic siloxanes with aryl iodides. Both the nature and position of substituents on the aromatic ring were studied. The results compiled in Table 13 reveal high compatibility with the common functional groups tested. For all aryl iodides examined, the reaction gave uniformly high yields. Noteworthy features of this process include the following: (1) electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups exhibit similar reactivity (entries 1 and 2), (2) the steric effect of ortho-substituents is minimal (entry 4) except in the cases where a possible chelation between the substituent and the palladium may slow the reductive elimination step (entries 5-7), (3) the reaction tolerates diverse functional groups such as ester, ether, nitro, and even free hydroxy group, and (4) the reactions of all iodides were stereospecific. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The cross-coupling of 74 was also successful with (E)-2-bromostyrene. The reaction rate and yield were slightly lower than that obtained with aryl iodides. With 2.5 mol % of &lsqb;allylPdCl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as the catalyst, the coupling product could be isolated in 78% yield after 5 hr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The influence of ring size on the cross-coupling reactin was examined. A variety of aryl iodides bearing various functional groups was selected to expand the utility of this transformation. The results collected in Table 14 reveal that (1) the different sizes of cyclic alkenyl silanes exhibit similar reactivity in the coupling reaction (entries 1 and 4) and (2) substitution on the &bgr;-trans-position of the silyl group did not affect the reactivity significantly (entry 2). The &agr;-substituted alkenyl silane 76c did undergo the coupling process; however, a significantly reduced reaction rate compared to the related silanes was observed. Moreover, the reaction mixture contained a substantial amount of self-coupling product of ethyl 3-iodobenzoate. The use of additives or slightly elevated temperatures did not improve the results. Fortunately, the addition of the iodide in portions satisfactorily suppressed the formation of the self-coupling product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Moreover, increasing the loading and portionwise addition of the Pd(0) complex also provided complete conversion and kept the palladium from precipitating in this slow coupling reaction. A comparison between these results and those described above reveals that monosubstitution of alkenyl silanes (silacyclobutanes and silanols) in either the &agr;- or &bgr;-position does not effect the rate of the cross-coupling process significantly. The disubstituted alkenyl silanes, including cyclic siloxanes, and silyl hydrides are also very reactive in the coupling process except in the case of the substitution on both of the &agr;- and &bgr;-cis-positions, for example, 76c. The steric influence may slow the coupling reaction and allow a competitive homocoupling of the aryl iodides to intervene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The cyclic siloxane 78 was formed by intramolecular hydrosilyation as will be discussed below.

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Siloxane 78 was dissolved in 2.0 equiv of a 1.0 M solution of TBAF in THF, followed by the addition of iodobenzene and 5 mol % of Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The siloxane did undergo the coupling process, however, at a significantly reduced reaction rate compared to the related silanols. Moreover, the reaction mixture was contaminated with a substantial amount of biphenyl (the product of self-coupling of iodobenzene), and thus the yield of the cross-coupling product was attenuated. The addition of various ligands or decreasing the amount of Pd(0) did not meaningfully improve the results. It was found, however, that adding the iodide in portions satisfactorily suppressed the formation of biphenyl and correspondingly improved the yield of the desired coupling product. The portionwise addition of the iodide proved to be effective in reducing the amount of homocoupling by-product in most cases. For a few, very slow reacting substrates, even this expedient was not helpful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> With a reproducible procedure in hand, the scope of the reaction with regard to the nature and position of substituents on the aromatic ring was explored The results compiled in Table 15 reveal good compatibility with all common functional groups tested (ester, ketone, nitro, alcohol, nitrile, ether). For all aryl iodides examined, the reaction proved to be mild and high yielding except in the case of 2-nitroiodobenzene (entry 4) which was very slow and gave a substantial amount of nitrobenzene as a by-product. Noteworthy features of this process are that (1) electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups exhibit similar reactivity, (2) ortho substituents on the aryl iodide do not affect the reactivity significantly, (3) the reaction tolerates diverse functional groups such as ester, nitro, cyano, ether, and even free hydroxy group, and (4) the reactions of all halides were stereospecific, with the exception of 4-nitroiodobenzene and l-iodonaphthalene, which gave a small amount of the geometrical isomer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> This variant of the coupling reaction is not limited to benzene derivatives. For instance, 1-iodonaphthalene, 1-bromo-4-tert-butyl-1-cyclohexene (an unactivated vinyl bromide), and 3-iodopyridine reacted with 78 to give the expected products 79k, 791, and 79m, respectively, in reasonable to good yield:

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The optimization of this process next turned to the investigation of the importance of the silicon substituents. It was of interest to see whether and how the size of the substituents on the silicon would affect the rate and selectivity of the reaction. Additional benefits such as improved mass efficiency and ease of by-product removal could be realized with a smaller group in place of an isopropyl group. We thus focused our attention oil the corresponding dimethylsiloxane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> However, the synthesis of the siloxanes was problematic. The intramolecular hydrosilylation of dimethylsilylethers with chloroplatinic acid resulted in polymeric materials. Though the platinum(0)-1,3 -divinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane complex (Pt(DVDS)) gave clean in-tramolecular hydrosilylation, any attempts to obtain the siloxane in a pure state or to scale-up the preparation of the siloxane led to oligomerization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A practical solution to this problem was conceived in the form of a one-pot protocol that would (1) obviate the need to isolate and purify the delicate silyl ether and siloxane and (2) improve the overall efficiency of the process. Thus, to streamline the procedure and minimize the formation of potentially deleterious by-products, tetramethyldisilazanem (TMDS) was employed as the silylating agent.

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Subjecting the hydridosilane 84 and 2-iodotoluene to the reaction protocol optimized with silanols gave rise to only a small amount of coupling product along with 1,5-diphenyl-3-pentanone from reduction of dba. The evolution of a gas when the silane was mixed with TBAF suggested that the silyl hydride was being hydrolyzes. It is well-known that hydrolysis or alcoholysis of silyl hydrides can be catalyzed by fluoride ion at room temperature to liberate hydrogen gas. Thus, it appeared that the coupling product observed could be the result of silanol generated in situ from the silyl hydride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The reaction protocol was slightly modified to examine whether or not in situ generation of the silanol from the silyl hydride could be used to obtain cross-coupling. Thus, the silyl hydride was first combined with TBAF (the activator) for 1-20 min. at room temperature until no further gas evolution was observed at which point the organic iodide and palladium catalyst were added sequentially to the reaction mixture. Using this revised method cross-coupling products as listed in Table 16 were prepared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Attempted reaction of the silyl hydride 86 under these conditions failed. It appears that silyl hydride 86 suffered rapid protiodesilylation in the presence of TBAF releasing dihydrofuran. Replacement of TBAF with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (3.0 equiv.) in methanol allowed the coupling of 86 with the aryl iodide to proceed smoothly in reasonable yield (Table 16) entry 6. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> For orienting experiments, 4-iodoacetophenone (96)was chosen to test the coupling of vinylpolysiloxanes using reaction conditions employed previously with minimum modification (5 mol % Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, two equivalents tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1.0 M in THF, room temperature). The established stoichiometry of transferable vinyl group to iodide was maintained at 1.2:1, thus the molar equivalents of each precursor was divided by the number of available vinyl groups. Silanes 92, 93 and 94 underwent rapid coupling. In all of these cases, the starting iodide was completely consumed at room temperature within 10 min to afford the product 97 in 88, 85 and 89% yields, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The coupling reaction of 95, however, did not proceed to completion. The initial rate of coupling, however, was not slow (78% conversion at 10 min). Even by extending the reaction time to 5 h, the reaction did not go to completion. Further increasing the loading of reagent 95 to 1.5:6 equivalents and also increasing the amount of TBAF to three equivalents gave 93% conversion at 10 min (entry 6), but the progress of the reaction once again stalled. A 2.0 mmol scale descriptive run under these conditions afforded the coupling product in low yield (53%). From these results it is clear that vinylation precursors 92, 93 or 94 could each be employed for this transformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> On the basis of cost and efficiency of vinyl transfer, the vinylpolysiloxane 92 was chosen for further examination of scope of the coupling reaction with a number of different aryl and alkenyl iodides. The results are collected in Table 18. As had been previously observed, the coupling reaction between 92 and electron poor iodides (4-iodoacetophenone 96, ethyl 4-iodobenzoate 98 and 3-iodonitrobenzene 102) proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding products in high yields. When the loading of Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was decreased to 1 mol %, the reaction of 92 with 98 was also complete in 1 h to afford the product in comparable yield (83%). In all these experiments, the catalyst was added last which caused a significant exotherm (up to 55&deg; C. on a 2 mmol scale) for the fast acting substrates (5, 7, 11). A modified procedure in which a solution of 96 was added last such that the temperature was maintained at &lt;30&deg; C., gave comparable results in the same time period (entry 2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> From foregoing studies on the coupling with electron-rich iodides, it is not surprising that the reaction of 4-iodoanisole with 92 was very sluggish under the same conditions. Although 100 was consumed after 4 h under the standard conditions (with three equivalents of TBAF), the isolated yield was quite low 46% (entry 4) and 15% of the corresponding Heck reaction product ((E)-4,4&prime;-dimethoxystilbene) was also isolated. In the cross coupling with 1-methyl-1-vinylsilacy-clobutane, the Heck reaction by-products were primarily observed with 100 and 110. In those cases, the intervention of the stilbene by-products was suppressed simply by increasing the amount of one to 1.2 and 1.5 equivalents, respectively. In this system, however, it seems that the Heck reaction is more competitive since a trace of stilbene was observed in the coupling reaction of 92 with 98 as well as with 100 and 110 (entries 2, 3). Moreover, in the coupling reaction of 100 and 110, increasing the amount of 92 was not effective in suppressing the side reaction. The yields of the desired products improved upon addition of 10 mol % Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>As (entry 5) although Heck product was still observed. Nevertheless, this material can be easily separated from the product by chromatography. The use of Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>As was beneficial for most of the slower coupling substrates. This allowed for the solubilization of the palladium (0) through many catalytic cycles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The effect of sterically demanding substituents observed in the coupling of 1-methyl-1-vinylsilacyclobutane was also seen in reactions with 92. Thus, reaction of 92 with 2-iodoanisole 105 was extremely sluggish compared with that of 4-iodoanisole 100 (6 vs. 24 h for completion). The importance of steric effects was apparent in the reaction of methyl 2-iodobenzoate 108, an electron poor iodide, which required 8 h to go to completion (entry 9, in the presence of 10 mol % Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>As) compared with just 10 min for the para-isomer 98 (entry 2). The compatibility of a free hydroxyl functional group was demonstrated in the successful coupling of 3-iodobenzyl alcohol (entry 7) at a reasonable rate and in good yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Finally, we also examined the coupling of vinylpolysiloxane 92 with (Z)-6-iodo-5-hexen-1 ol 112. Although the reaction was sluggish, it proceeded to completion in 24 h to give the diene 113 in 52% yield. The process was stereospecific as established by GC-MS analysis. The compatibility with the free hydroxyl group is also noted.

<heading lvl="1">Fluoride-free Cross Coupling Reactions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> One serious limitation in the use of a fluoride source as the activator of the cross-coupling reaction is that this agent precludes employment of this reaction in syntheses where either of the coupling substrates contains silyl protective groups. A non-fluoride-activated, organosilicon cross-coupling using inexpensive commercially available reagents has been developed which overcomes this limitation and further expands the utility of the cross-coupling reactions of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> The results of a survey of bases and solvents using (1-heptenyl)dimethylsilanol (E)-21 and 1-iodonaphthalene are collected in Table 20. Whereas the lithium silyloxide was unreactive, the sodium salt, generated with NaH in THF clearly manifested the feasibility of this new process (entries 1-4). 2.0 equiv of base was needed for complete conversion, which was then used throughout. The reaction is considerably faster in DMF and DME. Other sodium bases (i.e., NaOt-Bu) were less effective promoters. The use of potassium hydride had a dramatic effect on the rate giving complete conversion within 15 in DME. Finally, potassium tert-butoxide was also able to promote the reaction and gave the highest yield despite having the lowest rate of coupling. Weaker bases, such as K<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and K<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>were ineffective. In all cases examined the reaction was shown to be highly stereospecific. Scheme 11 illustrates reaction of vinyl silanols with aryl iodides in the presence of bases such as hydride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Application of the optimal reaction conditions to the coupling of (Z)-21 with 1-iodonaphthalene gave rapid cross-coupling but in markedly lower yields, Table 21, entry 1. The remainder of the mass balance was identified as naphthalene, presumably arising from the formation of a palladium hydride species from the excess KH. Although the formation of naphthalene could be suppressed by the use of KOt-Bu, the reaction rate with this base was far too low to be synthetically viable. Apparently, KOt-Bu is able to compete with the silyloxide for the palladium center thus serving as a competitive inhibitor. From this observation, it appears that the ideal base need only be strong enough to produce a measurable equilibrium concentration of the silyloxide, and not be a competitive inhibitor. Logically, the first choice would be another silyloxide, such as the soluble agent KOSiMe<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. 2.0 equiv of this mild base can effect the cross-coupling at room temperature, in excellent yield, with stereospecificity and without reduction by-products (albeit more slowly than KH). Neither increasing nor decreasing the amount of KOSiMe<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>improved the rate of the coupling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The scope of this new, fluoride-free coupling process was examined under the optimal conditions of 2.0 equiv of KOSiMe<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in DME at room temperature. The results in Table 22 illustrate that cross-coupling products were obtained in excellent yields with reasonable rates. High stereospecificities and good yields were obtained in the coupling of (E)-21 and (Z)-21 to 1-iodonaphthalene and iodobenzene. In addition, both electron rich (entries 7 and 8) and electron deficient (entries 5-6 and 9-12) arenes couple quite well, although with varying rates. In general, electron deficient electrophiles couple most rapidly, except 4-iodo-acetophenone. Apparently, the presence of a moderately acidic proton in the substrate has a detrimental effect on the rate of coupling, although the yields were still high and no other by-products were observed. In contrast to the fluoride-activated couplings of silanols, the rates of coupling with (Z)-21 were significantly lower than those with (E)-21 . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The synthetic potential of this new method is clearly demonstrated by the compatibility of a silyl protective group as shown in entries 13-14. The coupling reaction occurs cleanly in the presence of a TBS protected alcohol on the aryl iodide, 154 g, without any observable deprotection. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">One-pot Hydrosilyation/Cross-coupling </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Scheme 1 illustrates the hydrosilyation of terminal alkynes combined with cross-coupling reactions of this invention. A one-pot protocol was developed to carry out this reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The initial development of a one-pot protocol focused on the Pt-catalyzed hydrosilylation event. To optimize the hydrosilylation, the reaction of 1-heptyne with diisopropylchlorosilane was studied and the results were evaluated by directly carrying out the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling (THF, 1.0M TBAF (2 equiv.), Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(5 mol %), RT, 10 min.) with 1-iodonaphthalene. Hydrosilylation of 1-heptyne with diisopropylchlorosilane in the presence of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PtCl<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(&lt;0.1 mol %) at 50 &deg; C. for 30 min, followed by treatment with TBAF, Pd(dba) 2, and 1-iodonaphthalene gave incomplete coupling (70-80% conversion). No other isomeric, cross-coupling products ((Z)-169a or 170a) were observed by GC analysis. However, all attempts to improve the conversion failed. Consequently, a survey was performed to screen other silane sources and Pt catalysts for their activity and stereoselectivity in this transformation. Orienting experiments revealed that the regio- and stereoselectivity was strongly affected by the structure of silane. In the presence of Speier&apos;s catalyst, tetramethyldisiloxane, tetramethylcyclotetrasilioxane, and methyldiethoxysilane can participate in the hydrosilylation/cross-coupling reaction smoothly as evidenced by the complete consumption of 1-iodo naphthalene after 10 min. However, a small amount of the isomer 170a (12-16%) resulting from regio-reversed hydrosilylation was observed. To improve the hydrosilylation regioselectivity, tetraisopropyldisiloxane was used, but only a trace of cross-coupling product was observed even after extended reaction time or elevated reaction temperatures. Diethylethoxysilane was then examined as a compromise reactivity and selectivity. Surprisingly, this silane gave the poorest results; the regioselectivity was worse than with the methylsilanes, and the conversion was below about 60%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The next stage of optimization involved the examination of these silanes with other platinum catalysts to improve the rate and/or regioselectivity. The organic soluble complex Pt(0)-1,3-divinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (Pt(DVDS)) gave results comparable to those obtained with Speier&apos;s catalyst. However, the t-Bu<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P-modified Pt(DVDS) complex gave significantly improved results. The hydrosilylation with both 162 and 163 was complete within 30 min at room temperature in the presence of t-Bu<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P&mdash;Pt(DVDS), and the subsequent coupling reaction with 1-iodo naphthalene was complete in 10 min at room temperature. Moreover, with 162 the coupling product contained only 2% of the regioisomer 170. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> With an optimized procedure for the hydrosilylation/cross-coupling reaction in hand, a variety of iodides bearing various functional groups and substitution patterns were selected to define the scope of the one-pot process. The results presented Table 23 reveal that the rate, yield, and selectivity of this protocol correspond well to those features of the previous cross-coupling reactions of isolated silanols. For example, both electron-rich (entries 3, 4, 7, and 9) and electron-poor (entries 2, 5, 6, and 8) iodides underwent the coupling smoothly to give the desired product in high yield and excellent stereoselectivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The position and nature of substituents had little effect for most iodides (cf. entries 3 and 9). However, the rate of coupling of 168f was very slow and stalled as has been noted previously. This problem was resolved by adding 10 mol % of AsPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The coupling of 168h also proceeded smoothly to give desired product in reasonable yield, although some loss of specificity was observed. Further, 168i also showed good results when &lsqb;allylPdCl&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was used, but the specificity again was lower than with aryl halides. The origin of the erosion in stereospecificity is not understood at this time. As found in previous studies, it was possible to reduce the loading of the Pd catalyst for the coupling of electron-poor iodides, e.g., 168d. In the presence of 1 mol % of Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>the coupling product 169d was produced in 89% yield by extending the reaction time to 60 min with comparable selectivities (cf. entries 5 and 6). The standard reaction protocol developed in earlier studies for the cross-coupling calls for the addition of the palladium catalyst last (procedure I). For reactive electrophiles such as electron-deficient aryl iodides, the reaction becomes rather exothermic. This potential problem can be solved by simply changing the addition sequence such that TBAF and Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>were added to the hydrosilylation mixture first. The heat of reaction is then modulated by the slow addition of the iodide such that the internal temperature does not exceed 30&deg; C. (procedure U). The one-pot coupling of 168c gave 169c in 89% yield by using this modified procedure (cf. entries 3 and 4). The overall process displays good generality and functional compatibility with regard to the alkyne component as well, Table 24. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> A number of alkynes were evaluated with typical electron-poor (168b) and electron-rich (168c) substrates. The alkyne diversity is represented by aromatic (171), linear aliphatic (172), and branched aliphatic (173) types. In addition,we included unprotected alcohol functions (12 and 173) and a remote double bond (174). The coupling reaction of 171 proceeded smoothly to give products in high yield, and no regioisomer was detected by GC analysis. Furthermore, those alkynes that contain free hydroxy groups underwent facile, highly stereoselective coupling though the latter required a longer reaction time. The coupling of 174 also gave exceptional results. The double bond did not compete with the alkyne in the hydrosilylation, and no Heck reaction products were observed. However, some Sonogashira coupling of the alkyne was observed when the ratio of 162 tol74 was 0.65 /1.5 equiv. The by-product can be eliminated by increasing the 162/174 ratio to 0.98/1.5 and also extending the reaction time to 60 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In summary, an efficient hydrosilylation system uses inexpensive, nontoxic silicon reagents and soluble Pt catalyst. The in situ generated disiloxanes then undergo a Pd-catalyzed, cross-coupling for the mild, one-pot hydrocarbation of I-alkynes. This method is characterized by good generality, functional group compatibility, and stereoselectivity. </paragraph>

These siloxanes carry substituents on both alkenyl carbons and cross-coupling reaction with aryl iodides results in stereocontrolled synthesis of highly substituted unsaturated alcohols.

In initial studies on the RCM reaction of 203 using the Grubbs alkylidene complex, none of the desired ring-closure product 74, was observed. All variations in conditions, including change of solvent and/or temperature were unsuccessful. Substrate 203 did undergo the RCM process when the molybdenum complex 202 was used as the catalyst. After careful optimization a near quantitative yield of 74 was obtained with 5 mol % of 202 in benzene at ambient temperature.

<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The influence of tether length (i.e., ring size) and substituents on the RCM/cross-coupling process was examined as shown in Table 25. The allylic ether 207a (a five-membered ring precursor) suffered RCM under the standard conditions (5 mol % of Mo complex in benzene, 1 h); however, only 75% conversion could be obtained in 1 h. This problem was solved by increasing the catalyst loading; using 7 mol % of catalyst,the complete consumption of 207a was achieved within 3 h to afford the product 208a in 89% yield (Table 25, entry 1) However, for the preparation of seven-membered siloxane 208d, the reaction only went to 91%completion, giving an 81% yield under these conditions. With a monosubstituted alkene or monosubstituted vinylsilane (entries 2 and 3), the RCM process proceeded slowly compared to 74 albeit ultimately to completion. Unfortunately, substitution on both the alkene and vinylsilane (entry 4) did not lead to successful closure (even under harsher conditions), presumably as a result of the significant increase in steric demand. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Facsile cross-coupling reactions of this invention are observed with organosilicon reagents having oxygen function on the silicon, e.g., alcohols, ethers or disiloxanes. Starting materials for the coupling reactions herein can be obtained by intramolecular hydrosilylation of a pendant silyl ether (35). This process provides an unambiguous route to geometrically defined vinyl silanes having an oxygen function. This strategy, as illustrated in Scheme 14, is exemplified for the preparation of stereo defined homoallylic alcohols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In particular, the cyclic siloxane 78 (where R is CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;) derived from 3-pentyn-ol (211 where R is CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;) was examined to illustrate the combination of intramolecular hydrosilylation and cross-coupling of this invention. Silylation of the alkynol with diisopropylchlorosilane provided a silyl ether in good yield which was then subjected to intramolecular hydrosilylation using a catalytic amount of Speier&apos;s catalyst:

<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Palladium cross-coupling reaction of 78 with various aryl iodides are examined in Table 15, discussed above. Attempts to extend the intramolecular hydrosilyation to dimethyl siloxanes resulted in the generation of undesired polymeric materials. A practical solution to this problem was the establishment of a one-pot protocol that obviated the isolation and purification of delicate silyl ethers and siloxanes and improved overall efficiency of the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In this process a homopropargyl alcohol (e.g., 211) is treated with a silylating agent, tetramethyl disilazane (TMDS). The product (not isolated) is dissolved in THF in the presence of a platinum catalyst to facilitate intramolecular silylation ring closure. Cross-coupling was then carried out with the siloxane ring closure product (also not isolated). The results of the one-pot arylation of homopropargyl alcohols are shown in Table 26. As indicated in the table, increased loading of Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to 10 mol % resulted in significant improvement in rate and yield of the cross-coupling product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> It is believed that residual TMDS, which may poison the palladium catalyst, is detrimental to the cross-coupling reaction. TMDS is preferably removed (if possible in view of the volatility of the silyl ether) by evaporation upon completion of silylation. When a higher molecular weight alcohol (e.g., 3-octyn-1-ol) was used as the starting material, TMDS could be easily removed and cross-coupling was effectively promoted with lower levels of Pd catalyst (5 mol % Pd(dba)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the one-pot procedure are clear: (1) ease of experimental protocol, (2) no need to add aryl iodide portionwise to avoid homocoupling, (3) intermediate silyl ethers need not be isolated, and (4) superior overall yields. However, the multi-stage procedure in which the isopropyl substituted siloxane 78 is isolated is superior in providing for stereospecificity in the products. In the one-pot procedure using the dimethylsiloxane a small amount of the other stereoisomer (the (Z)-isomer in the examples of Table 26) was observed. All attempts to suppress the formation of this isomer where unsuccessful. The minor product was not eliminated, for example, by decreasing the reaction concentration for hydrosilylation or by changing the hydrosilylation catalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> These results demonstrate the expanded synthetic potential of the silicon-based cross-coupling reaction of this invention. The silicon atom has served in the following capacities: as a temporary protecting group for the hydoxyl function, as a temporary tether to fix the geometry of the vinyl silane and as the locus for directing formation of a new C&mdash;C bond. In a very mild and environmentally friendly manner, homopropargyl alcohols are elaborated stereospecifically to trisubstituted homoallylic alcohols in good yields. These structures are often encountered in natural products and also are useful synthetic intermediates. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to solid catalysts. In particular, the invention relates to solid catalysts that contain a microporous framework. More particularly, the invention relates to novel SAPO catalysts. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Control of selectivity is a central problem in catalysis, and this is particularly challenging with the microporous solid acid catalysts used in most industrial catalytic processes. Of particular interest here is methanol-to-olefin (MTO) catalysis, which has enormous commercial potential as discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Light olefins, defined herein as ethylene, propylene, and butylene, serve as feeds for the production of numerous chemicals. Olefins traditionally are produced by petroleum cracking. Because of the limited supply and/or the high cost of petroleum sources, the cost of producing olefins from petroleum sources has increased steadily. For example, the large increase in demand for polyethylene has nearly exceeded the capacity of refineries to produce ethylene as a byproduct of petroleum conversion to gasoline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for alternative feedstocks for the production of light olefins. Amongst such feedstocks are oxygenates, such as alcohols, particularly methanol, dimethyl ether, and ethanol. Alcohols may be produced by fermentation, or from synthesis gas derived from natural gas, petroleum liquids, carbonaceous materials, including coal, recycled plastics, municipal wastes, or any organic material. Consequently, because of the wide variety of Attorney Docket sources, alcohol, alcohol derivatives, and other oxygenates have promise as an economical, non-petroleum source for olefin production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Methanol is a particularly attractive olefin feedstock because it can be produced from natural gas, mostly methane, which is so inexpensive near the well head that it is frequently vented or flared. Converting natural gas to methanol has the added advantage of reducing pollution because venting or flaring natural gas causes emissions of methane and CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, respectively, which are greenhouse gases. Further, methanol has the advantage that it, unlike natural gas, is easily transported using conventional tankers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Because of the attractiveness of methanol as a potential olefin feedstock, there is intense developmental effort focused on converting methanol to olefins. Several major petrochemical companies are operating methanol-to-olefin (MTO) pilot plants, and large scale commercialization is expected in several years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The catalysts used to promote the conversion of oxygenates to olefins are molecular sieve catalysts. For example, the earliest MTO processes were based on the aluminosilicate zeolite HZSM-5, a material with channels ca. 0.55 nm in diameter. ZSM-5 has been extensively studied for the conversion of methanol to olefins. Unfortunately, ZSM-5 produces not only the desired light olefins, but also undesired by-products. In particular, ZSM-5 produces aromatics, particularly at high methanol conversion. Aromatics such as toluene and p-xylene readily diffuse through the ZSM-5 topology. At one time aromatics were used in gasoline formulations but aromatics are no longer desirable in US gasoline, and to serve as an MTO catalyst, HZSM-5 must be modified to greatly reduce aromatic formation. This has been attempted, with some degree of success, by further restricting the channel size, usually by partial exchange with Mg<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> or by adsorbing an organic phosphorous compound and calcining to leave some kind of phosphate debris in the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The foregoing points to the need for MTO catalysts that do not produce large amounts of unwanted by-products, such as aromatics, methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen gas. Furthermore, because ethylene and propylene are the most sought after products of the MTO conversion reaction, there is a need for catalysts that are most selective to ethylene and/or propylene, and for methods for increasing the selectivity of the reaction to ethylene and/or propylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Towards that end, zeolites with a small pore size are being developed because such zeolites have a higher selectivity to lower alkenes, even at 100 mol % methanol conversion. However, even though small pore size zeolites have a higher selectivity to lower alkenes, there is a need to further tailor zeolites to achieve other process objective. For example, amongst lower alkenes, there is a need for catalysts that selectively produce ethylene over propylene or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This invention provides catalysts that provide such desirable characteristics, and also provides novel methods for tailor-making catalysts with desirable properties. </paragraph>

Illustrations of the chabazite (CHA) topology. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. (LEFT) Extended structure showing the interconnection of cages through narrow six-ring windows that are ca. 0.38 nm in diameter. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. (RIGHT) Expanded view emphasizing a cage, which is ca. 1.0 nm by 0.7 nm. SAPO-34 would be of this composition except with (typically) one substitution of Si for P per cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. GC (flame ionization) analyses of the product gases in MTO experiments on HSAPO-34. Identical, 20 mL methanol pulses were applied at 0 s and at 360 s to the same catalyst bed: (a) 4 s after a first pulse the total conversion of methanol and dimethylether (DME) to hydrocarbons was only ca. 14%. (b) 364 s after the first pulse and 4 s after the second pulse, the conversion was essentially 100%. (c) This control experiment, on a second catalyst bed shows that only traces of products exit the reactor 358 s after the first methanol pulse; hence, the products observed at 364 s reflect conversion of the second methanol pulse. Note that even an active catalyst produces more propene than ethylene. It is desirable to increase ethylene selectivity. </paragraph>

Each sample was prepared by injecting 20 mL of methanol-<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C onto a freshly activated catalyst bed (0.3 g) while He was flowed at 600 mLmin-1, and reaction occurred for the times shown followed by a rapid thermal quench. All spectra (4000 scans) were measured at 298 K using a 2-ms contact time. Methylbenzenes form as signaled by resonances at 129 ppm to 134 ppm and methyl groups at 20 ppm. The 56 ppm resonance is due to framework bound methoxy (methoxonium) groups. </paragraph>

The PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>flow rate was 14 sccm except for the sample in c where 32 sccm was used. Methanol/PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>mole ratios are shown on the figure. (a) With a limiting amount of methanol the major product in the nanocages was P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, which was protonated by the Br&oslash;nsted acid sites (&minus;4 ppm). (b) P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> (23 ppm) formed almost quantitatively in most nanocages when methanol was in excess.

For each case, a fresh catalyst bed was used to convert 0.1 mL of methanol-<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C at a WHSV of 8 h<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, and then methanol flow was abruptly cut off. The catalyst bed was maintained at temperature with He flow (200 sccm) for the time indicated, and then the reactor temperature was rapidly quenched to ambient. Entire catalyst beds were loaded into MAS rotors to avoid sampling errors, and cross polarization spectra were measured at room temperature (2 ms contact time, 2000 scans). The average numbers of methyl groups per ring Me<highlight><subscript>ave</subscript></highlight>, were calculated from Bloch decay spectra (90&deg; pulse, 10 s delay) very similar to the cross polarization spectra shown. </paragraph>

For these measurements, multiple gas samples were analyzed from a single catalyst bed as it evolved over time after cessation of methanol flow. Ethylene and propylene are primary products of MTO chemistry. It can be shown that C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>products are due to secondary reactions of propylene. (B) Ethylene and propylene selectivity as a function of the average number of methyl groups per ring, Me<highlight><subscript>ave</subscript></highlight>.

This mapping shows that ethylene is favored by methylbenzenes with 2 or 3 methyl groups, while propylene is favored with four or more methyl groups. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the conversion of oxygenates to light olefins, it is desirable to maximize the production of ethylene and/or propylene and to minimize the production of undesired by-products, such as methane, ethane, propane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen gas, and C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> materials, including aromatics. In one embodiment of the invention, catalysts comprising a silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) molecular sieve are used to produce the desired products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> SAPO Molecular Sieves as Catalysts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves are generally classified as being microporous materials having 8, 10, or 12 membered ring structures. These ring structures can have an average pore size ranging from about 3.5-15 angstroms. Preferred are the small pore SAPO molecular sieves having an average pore size ranging from about 3.5 to 5 angstroms. These pore sizes are typical of molecular sieves having 8 membered rings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In general, silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves comprise a molecular framework of corner-sharing SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, AlO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and PO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedral units. This type of framework is effective in converting various oxygenates into olefin products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The PO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedral units within the framework structure of the molecular sieve of this invention can be provided by a variety of compositions. Examples of these phosphorus-containing compositions include phosphoric acid, organic phosphates such as triethyl phosphate, and aluminophosphates. The phosphorous-containing compositions are mixed with reactive silicon and aluminum-containing compositions under the appropriate conditions to form the molecular sieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The AlO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedral units within the framework structure can be provided by a variety of compositions. Examples of these aluminum-containing compositions include aluminum alkoxides such as aluminum isopropoxide, aluminum phosphates, aluminum hydroxide, sodium aluminate, and pseudoboehmite. The aluminum-containing compositions are mixed with reactive silicon and phosphorus-containing compositions under the appropriate conditions to form the molecular sieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedral units within the framework structure can be provided by a variety of compositions. Examples of these silicon-containing compositions include silica sols and silicium alkoxides such as tetra ethyl orthosilicate. The silicon-containing compositions are mixed with reactive aluminum and phosphorus-containing compositions under the appropriate conditions to form the molecular sieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Substituted SAPOs can also be used in this invention. These compounds are generally known as MeSAPOs or metal-containing silicoaluminophosphates. The metal can be alkali metal ions (Group IA), alkaline earth metal ions (Group IIA), rare earth ions (Group IIIB, including the lanthanoid elements: lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and lutetium; and scandium or yttrium) and the additional transition cations of Groups IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB, VIIIB, and IB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the Me represents atoms such as Zn, Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, Ga, Fe, Ti, Zr, Ge, Sn, and Cr. These atoms can be inserted into the tetrahedral framework through an MeO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedral unit. The MeO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>tetrahedral unit carries a net electric charge depending on the valence state of the metal substituent. When the metal component has a valence state of &plus;2, &plus;3, &plus;4, &plus;5, or &plus;6, the net electric charge is &minus;2, &minus;, 0, &plus;1, and &plus;2, respectively. Incorporation of the metal component is typically accomplished by adding the metal component during synthesis of the molecular sieve. However, post-synthesis ion exchange can also be used. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,762, the description of the post-synthesis ion exchange method in which is fully incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves suitable for the invention include SAPO-5, SAPO-8, SAPO-11, SAPO-16, SAPO-17, SAPO-18, SAPO-20, SAPO-31, SAPO-34, SAPO-35, SAPO-36, SAPO-37, SAPO-40, SAPO-41, SAPO-42, SAPO-44, SAPO-47, SAPO-56, and the metal substituted forms thereof. Preferred are SAPO-l 8, SAPO-34, SAPO-35, SAPO-44, and SAPO-47, particularly SAPO-18 and SAPO-34. The molecular sieves can be used alone or in combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieves are synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization methods generally known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,440,871; 4,861,743; 5,096,684; and 5,126,308 for descriptions of such methods, which are fully incorporated herein by reference. A reaction mixture is formed by mixing together reactive silicon, aluminum and phosphorus components, along with at least one template. Generally the mixture is sealed and heated, preferably under autogenous pressure, to a temperature of at least 100&deg; C., preferably from 100-250&deg; C., until a crystalline product is formed. Formation of the crystalline product can take anywhere from around 2 hours to as much as 2 weeks. In some cases, stirring or seeding with crystalline material will facilitate the formation of the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Typically, the molecular sieve product will be formed in solution. It can be recovered by standard means, however, such as by centrifugation or filtration. The product can also be washed, recovered by the same means and dried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The molecular sieves may be admixed (blended) with other materials. When blended, the resulting composition is typically referred to as a catalyst, with the catalyst comprising the molecular sieve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Materials which can be blended with the molecular sieve can be various inert or binder materials. These materials include compositions such as kaolin and other clays, various forms of alumina or alumina sol, titania, zirconia, quartz, silica or silica or silica sol, and mixtures thereof. These components are also effective in reducing overall catalyst cost, acting as a thermal sink to assist in heat shielding the catalyst during regeneration, densifying the catalyst and increasing catalyst strength. When blended with inert or binder materials, the amount of molecular sieve which is contained in the final catalyst product ranges from 10 to 90 weight percent, preferably 30 to 70 weight percent. The invention contemplates within its scope molecular sieves blended with inert and/or binder materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> For MTO catalysis, HSAPO-34 and closely related materials (e.g., those with small amounts of metals in the framework) have recently emerged as the materials of choice, in part because aromatics can not diffuse through the windows in these materials. HSAPO-34 has the CHA topology (6) characterized by cages of ca. 1.0 nm by 0.7 nm diameter that are interconnected through 8-ring windows of ca. 0.38 nm in diameter. Thus, molecules such as methanol, phosphine, ammonia, acetone, and propene may freely diffuse through the framework, but larger molecules, even those with kinetic diameters comparable to those of isobutane or 2-methylpropene, are not adsorbed. During MTO conversion on HSAPO-34 the organic components, i.e., methylbenzenes, self-assemble in the nanometer-size cages during a kinetic induction period, where they must remain until burned out, as even benzene is too large to pass through the 0.38 nm windows connecting adjacent cages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The CHA family encompasses a large number of distinct materials, differentiated by framework composition. The most simple examples are the aluminosilicate zeolite chabazite (7) and the aluminophosphate AlPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-34. The topological unit cell contains 36 tetrahedral sites; in the case of AlPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-34, 18 of which are aluminum and 18 are phosphorous. There are three cages per topological cell. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows an enlarged view of the CHA structure focusing on a single cage and its immediate environment. In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides for functionalizing the interior of such catalyst cages. While the cages themselves are ca. 1 nm in size, they are interconnected, and hence accessed, through much smaller windows, which implies that molecules larger (with molecular size being defined by the molecule&apos;s kinetic diameter) than the windows cannot enter the cages. The invention provides for novel ship-in-a-bottle synthesis methods to introduce such large molecules into the cages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Variations of CHA frameworks are readily prepared with metals such as cobalt (8-10) or nickel (11-14) substitution as a well as with gallium instead of aluminum. (15) One of the preferred materials of the invention, SAPO-34, is a silico-aluminophosphate. (16) Partial substitution of silicon for phosphorous introduces anion sites into the framework requiring cations in the cages for charge balance. In an exemplary embodiment, SAPO-34 is synthesized through a procedure (17) that yields a material with one tetraethylammonium cation (the template) in each cage. Calcination of the as-synthesized material is achieved by heating in air at 600&deg; C. This bums the template out leaving the catalyst in the acid form. The acid form of this material is denoted as HSAPO-34. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> SAPO-34 can also be prepared with two acid sites per cage by using morpholine, a cyclic, secondary amine. (18-20) There is no generally accepted, compact nomenclature for differentiating these two materials. In this patent H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SAPO-34 is used to explicitly refer to materials prepared so as to have two acid sites per cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The invention, in a preferred embodiment, is concerned with the functionalization of the nanocages of SAPO-34, largely through reactions at the acid site, and for the purpose of modifying acid catalyzed reactions. In this regard, HSAPO-34 and H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SAPO-34 will potentially have very different properties. For example, it may be possible to functionalize H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SAPO-34 to replace one and only one acid site per cage with a bulky, thermally stable group, leaving the other site available for catalysis in a more constrained environment. An analogous functionalization of HSAPO-34 could titrate every acid site, providing a material with the desired constraints but no acid function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Roles for Molecules in the Cages of SAPO-34 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> reports gas chromatographic traces (21) that illustrate MTO catalysis on HSAPO-34. For each case illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, methanol was pulsed onto a bed of HSAPO-34 at 450&deg; C. in a flowing stream of He, and a gas sample from the product stream was taken automatically at a certain time and injected onto the column. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shows the result of pulsing methanol onto a freshly activated (i.e., organic-free) catalyst bed and then sampling the product stream 4 s later; the conversion of methanol to olefinic products is poor-only 14%. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows, when a second methanol pulse is injected onto the same catalyst bed 360 s after the first, the conversion goes to 100%. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is a control experiment that shows that the products leaving the reactor 360 s after a first pulse are negligible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Mass balance shows that much of the carbon from the first pulse remains on the catalyst. The organic species on the catalyst were characterized by preparing a series of catalysts using the pulse-quench method. (21-25) Briefly, a series of HSAPO-34 catalyst beds were activated, and onto each fresh catalyst a single pulse of methanol was injected, allowed to react for a variable time, and then the temperature of the catalyst bed was rapidly (ca. 200 ms) quenched by flowing onto it a large volume of cryogenically cooled nitrogen gas. Quenched catalyst beds were opened in a nitrogen glove box, transferred to air-tight magic-angle NMR rotors, and <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C solid state NMR spectra were measured at room temperature. These spectra are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. (21) After 4 s of reaction there is a dramatic reduction in the amount of methanol on the catalyst and methyl-substituted aromatics form as signaled by the aromatic resonance at 129 ppm (with a shoulder at 134 ppm due to substituted ring carbons) and methyl groups at 20 ppm. Other upfield signals are accounted for by alkane products trapped in the cages. The average number of methyl groups per ring reaches a maximum of ca. 4 between 30 and 120 s of reaction, but this decreases to ca. 1.4 after the catalyst ages for 7200 s at 673 K without injection of additional feed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> HSAPO-34 catalysts that are active for MTO chemistry have methylbenzenes trapped in their nanocages that self-assemble there. GC-MS shows that when a first pulse is methanol-<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C and the second pulse is methanol-<highlight><superscript>12</superscript></highlight>C, the predominant isotopomer of ethylene in the product stream has one carbon of each isotope. This is evidence that olefin synthesis occurs by methylation of these methylbenzenes. Without intending to be bound by any theory, the mechanism probably involves side-chain alkylation to form ethyl and propyl (or isopropyl) chains, followed by olefin elimination. Alternatively, highly methylated benzenes can rearrange to extend alkyl chains. Either way these species generate the primary olefinic products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Thus, the active site for olefin synthesis on HSAPO-34 is a composite of an organic species and an inorganic acid site, which can activate methanol and hold methyl cation equivalents. All of this takes place in a nanocage that preserves the organic component and regulates selectivity through steric constraints. The HSAPO-34 active site, then, is no less elegant than those praised in enzyme chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Nano-Functionaization of HSAPO-34 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The following example describes a catalyst that delivers higher ethylene selectivity than standard HSAPO-34, which, in accordance with the invention, was made by a rational process of functionalizing the nanocages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> presents a reaction scheme for modification of HSAPO-34 by incorporation of various phosphorous species derived from PH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Phosphine is a very reactive, toxic compound, but it is volatile and small enough to pass through the 0.38 nm windows that interconnect nano-cages. Neither PH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) nor PH(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are commercially available, and P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is too large for absorption. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows <highlight><superscript>31</superscript></highlight>P solid state NMR spectra of SAPO-34 catalysts modified by the reactions in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In each case, the <highlight><superscript>31</superscript></highlight>P resonance at &minus;28 ppm is due to phosphorous in the framework. The ratio of P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(&tilde;4 ppm) and P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> (23 ppm) in the cages can be controlled by varying the ratio of PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OH introduced into the flow reactor at 250&deg; C. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also shows a <highlight><superscript>31 </superscript></highlight>spectrum of a SAPO-34 containing both P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and aromatics. Note that there are two P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> resonances, one as before at 23 ppm, but with aromatics present there is also a second peak at 20 ppm. This second peak is almost certainly from cages that contain both P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and an aromatic ring, and the upfield shift suggests that the cation is above the plane of the aromatic ring. With sufficient PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>one P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> cation in every nano-cage could be synthesized, and the <highlight><superscript>31</superscript></highlight>P spectrum then shows a perfect 5:1 ratio of framework to cation signals. When P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> is heated to 600&deg; C. in SAPO-34, it decomposes to an inorganic phosphate species and at even higher temperatures this appears to react with the framework to yield a material that has been only partially characterized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> reports GC traces from the product streams of reactors converting methanol under steady-state conditions (WHSV&equals;8 h<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>) at 450&deg; C. using either standard HSAPO-34 or functionalized materials. With the standard catalyst, conversion was 100% and ethylene selectivity was 37%. Using a material with one P(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus;cation in every cage, conversion was near zero, because the acid sites were removed by phosphonium formation. Calcination of this sample in the reactor to form a material with phosphate in every cage (or a reaction product thereof) produced a catalyst with greatly improved ethylene selectivity, 46%, but slightly reduced activity. When a material with phosphate in most but not all cages was prepared, the catalyst achieved nearly 100% conversion and retained an impressive ethylene selectivity of 44%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates a scheme for functionalizing SAPO-34 nano-cages to realize desired changes in product selectivity. Such a scheme is easily implemented to achieve any desired functionality in the nanocages. The selection of phosphate acid as a modifier is based on analogous efforts to modify zeolite HZSM-5, which is straightforward due to the 0.55 nm channels of that zeolite. It appears that phsophate functionalized HSAPO-34 has a higher ethylene selectivity because of steric constraints on intermediates and transition states leading to larger olefins in the more-crowded nano-cages of the modified catalyst. These effects can also be achieved by the introduction of other functionalities into the nanocages. Thus, in various exemplary embodiments the invention provides for introducing functionalities created by the reaction within or with the nanocages of an inorganic molecule that is selected from the group consisting of PH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, and B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. Such a reaction product may be selected from the group consisting of phosphoric acid, boric acid, silica, a product of the hydrolysis of PH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, a product of the hydrolysis of SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, a product of the hydrolysis of Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, a product of the hydrolysis of B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, a product of the oxidation of PH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, a product of the oxidation of SiH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, a product of the oxidation of Si<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and a product of the oxidation of B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and a product of any of the foregoing compounds with a nanocage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Relationship of Structure to Selectivity of MTO Kinetics </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The following &ldquo;pulse-quench NMR&rdquo; experiments demonstrate a connection between structure and selectivity and provide further details on MTO kinetics. In pulse-quench experiments, pulses of reagents are injected (commonly stable isotope chemicals) onto a catalyst sample in a flow reactor at some high temperature, which is abruptly (200 ms) reduced to near ambient following a predetermined reaction time. GC or GC-MS is used to analyze the volatile products captured at various times in the reaction, and solid state NMR probes the composition of the quenched catalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As discussed more fully below, by correlating the time evolution of the catalysts&apos; <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C NMR spectra and the volatile product distribution following abrupt cessation of methanol flow, it was discovered that (in the absence of other adsorbates) propene is favored by methylbenzenes with four to six methyl groups but ethylene is predominant from those with two or three methyl groups. Ethylene selectivity is substantially increased by operating at lower methanol partial pressures or higher temperatures, either of which reduces the steady-state average methyl substitution. As a step toward a kinetic analysis of the MTO reaction on HSAPO-34, each nanocage was treated with a methylbenzene molecule as a supramolecule capable of unimolecular dissociation into ethylene or propene and a less highly substituted methylbenzene. Addition of a water molecule to a nanocage containing a methylbenzene produces a distinct supramolecule with unique properties. Indeed, co-feeding water with methanol significantly increases the average number of methyl groups per ring at steady state relative to identical conditions without additional water, and also increases ethylene selectivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A series of experiments was carried out in which 0.1 mL of methanol or methanol-<highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C was first flowed onto a 300 mg bed of pelletized HSAPO-34 at 400&deg; C. at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 8 h<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>before abruptly terminating methanol flow and waiting a variable time before quenching the catalyst temperature to ambient. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> reports solid state <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C MAS NMR spectra of catalysts prepared using delays from 0 to 60 min. These spectra show an aromatic carbon signal between 129 and 134 ppm, and a methyl group resonance at 20 ppm that drops with increasing delay between methanol cut-off and thermal quench. A small, sharp resonance at 25 ppm is due to isobutane, which like the methylbenzenes, is too large to exit the nanocages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C NMR spectra permit direct measurement of the average number of methyl groups per benzene ring in the catalyst, Me<highlight><subscript>ave </subscript></highlight>(Eq. 1).

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> fn denotes the fractions of rings with n methyl groups. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, Me<highlight><subscript>ave </subscript></highlight>decreased from a nearly full complement of 5.6 immediately after methanol cut-off to 2.1 (e.g., xylenes on average) after 60 min. The last methyl group could be removed only with great difficulty. At 450&deg; C., Me<highlight><subscript>ave </subscript></highlight>was 1.1 after 60 min and 0.2 after 14 h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> reports gas chromatographic analyses of samples taken from the product streams immediately prior to thermal quench for several of the experiments used to prepare the samples for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. One minute after methanol cut-off, the catalyst was still producing olefinic products with an ethylene selectivity only slightly higher than that immediately prior to cut-off. In particular, at this point the catalyst shows a much higher selectivity for propylene than for ethylene. As the catalyst continued to age at 400&deg; C. with He flow but no further addition of methanol, the total rate of olefin production necessarily fell, but the ethylene selectivity increased dramatically, surpassing that of propylene between 6 and 12 minutes after cut-off. The rates of formation of ethylene, propylene, and a representative C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>product from a single experiment were measured in which a number of gas chromatographic injections were made as a function of time, and these data are plotted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. Ethylene dominated after 8 min. C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>products arise from secondary reactions and are hereafter neglected. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> compares the ethylene and propylene selectivities, computed from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, as a function of the time evolution of the average number of methyl groups per ring-a mapping made possible by a smooth fit of the data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The data establishes the relationship between molecular structure and selectivity. A change-over in selectivity to ethylene occurs when the number of methyl groups per ring decreased to 2.9, and further decreases in propylene selectivity accompanied further decreases in methyl substitution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The following experiment demonstrates the use of rational means for limiting the average number of methyl groups per ring. The methanol space velocity was varied by four orders of magnitude and the steady-state selectivities (all at 400&deg; C. and 100% conversion) reported in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> were measured. The ethylene selectivity, which was only 25% at the highest space velocities, increased dramatically as the space velocity was reduced, and steady-state selectivity of 63% at the lowest space velocity was measured. Steady-state values of Me<highlight><subscript>ave </subscript></highlight>were measured at five space velocities using NMR spectra similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> (0 min delay), and representative examples are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Based on those measurements, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> maps the selectivity data in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> onto an Me<highlight><subscript>ave </subscript></highlight>coordinate. Under steady-sate conditions, in a catalyst that also contains some methanol and other products in the nanocages, the change-over in selectivity for ethylene vs. propylene occurred at M<highlight><subscript>eave</subscript></highlight>&equals;2.1 compared to 2.9 without methanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It was also found that for a fixed space velocity of 8 h<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, Me<highlight><subscript>ave </subscript></highlight>decreased with increasing temperature, and again this correlated with higher ethylene selectivity. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows that at 450&deg; C. Me<highlight><subscript>ave </subscript></highlight>was 4.3 (cf. 5.6 at 400&deg; C.) and further dropped to 2.0 at 550&deg; C. The ethylene selectivities were 25% at 400&deg; C., 34% at 450&deg; C., and 50% at 550&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The overall kinetics of olefin synthesis on HSAPO-34 are very complicated, and no doubt vary with co-adsorption of methanol, water, or other species into the nano-cages containing the methylaromatics. However, a simplified model can be developed as follows. Consider the simplest case, the cut-off experiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, where the decomposition of methylbenzenes in otherwise empty cages to ethylene or propylene and less-substituted methylbenzenes may be treated as unimolecular dissociation steps. Further, consider the possible reactions of a trimethylbenzene molecule isolated in a nanocage. It is assumed that equilibration of isomers is rapid compared to olefin elimination. Trimethylbenzene can be treated as a single species. Trimethylbenzene can either loose ethylene and leave toluene with a rate constant k3e, or it can instead lose propylene and leave benzene with a rate constant k3p (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). If all methylbenzenes function independently, then the decrease in the average number of methyl groups per ring, Me<highlight><subscript>ave</subscript></highlight>, in an experiment like <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is described by Eq. 2.

While xylene cannot eliminate propene, k<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>e </superscript></highlight>is not necessarily zero. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows that the change-over in selectivity at 400&deg; C. occurs with three methyl groups per ring, implying that k<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>e</superscript></highlight>&gt;k<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>p</superscript></highlight>. It can be concluded that retention of at least one methyl group on the ring stabilizes transition states leading to olefin elimination. Also, k<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>p </superscript></highlight>is greater than k<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>e</superscript></highlight>, and propene is favored at higher space velocities and lower temperatures. Unfortunately, have the following inequalities, k<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>p</superscript></highlight>&gt;k<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>p </superscript></highlight>and k<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>e</superscript></highlight>&gt;k<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>e</superscript></highlight>, also exist and the conditions for the most rapid methanol conversion on this catalyst (large Me<highlight><subscript>ave</subscript></highlight>) are not those that provide the highest ethylene selectivity (small Me<highlight><subscript>ave</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> One possibility for nanocage functionalization is to substitute the methylbenzenes with heteroatoms. The rationale for this is that one or more of the steps in detailed mechanisms for reactions as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> must involve the development of charge separation, and functional group substitutents on aromatic rings invariably alter the kinetics of aromatic substitution reactions. For example, phenolic and amino substitutents are activating for electrophilic reactions, while Cl, CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, etc. are deactivating. A person of ordinary skill in the art can determine with routine experimentation the substituents that would improve catalyst activity or selectivity. In one experiment, phenolic functionality was introduced to existing methylbenzenes in HSAPO-34. This was done using dilute air as an oxidant, though it was also done using a modification of the cumene-hydroperoxide route to phenol. It was found that phenol and catechol rings were no more active than the unreacted benzene rings also present in the catalyst, and there were no obvious changes in selectivity. It is possible that the attempt to realize an activated aromatic ring in a SAPO-34 catalyst was frustrated by pore blockage or some other unanticipated consequence of the partial oxidation reaction, which was carried out near the combustion threshold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Synthesized Cl and CF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>substituted aromatics were also attempted by more direct ship-in-a-bottle routes (as opposed to post-synthesis functionalization of aromatics). However, these have also proven difficult, in part due to the corrosive effects of acid gases eliminated at high temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, including a bulky species (e.g., H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) in the HSAPO-34 cage increases ethylene selectivity, presumably by imposing steric constraints on the more bulky transition states leading to propene. An alternate possibility for achieving a similar effect is to use methylnapthalenes instead of methylbenzenes without a second species in the nano-cage. It is known that as HSAPO-34 is deactivated during methanol conversion, (almost) every cage fills with methylnapthalene. (21) Therefore, synthesizing methylnapthalenes in a few of the nano-cages would provide a material with better ethylene selectivity because of the lower free volume in the active cages. Futhermore, even without steric constraints in the cages, each of the two rings in napthalene can bear no more than four methyl substitutents. If &ldquo;cross-over&rdquo; of methyl groups from one ring to the next is slow under reaction conditions, the results in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 9</cross-reference> show that methylnapthalenes would intrinsically yield higher ethylene selectivities, even without steric constraints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, a material with two acid sites per cage, which we call H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SAPO-34, can be made using morpholine rather than tetraethylammonium as template. H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SAPO-34 has a bad reputation. It is more moisture-sensitive than HSAPO-34, and the higher acid site density promotes secondary reaction leading to C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>products as well as more rapid deactivation by excessive aromatic formation. However, H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SAPO-34 offers possibilities for nano-functionalization schemes that would not be possible using conventional HSAPO-34. For example, with two acid sites, one and only one could be replaced with a bulky cation, possibly a phosphonium ion as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, while leaving the second acid site intact to work with a methylbenzene molecule in the same cage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> With conventional HSAPO-34, all of the acid sites are (ideally) identical, and this is reflected, for example, in a <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H MAS NMR spectrum consisting of a single, sharp line. However, we have found a very small fraction (ca. 2-4%) of sites on the HSAPO-34 materials of the invention to be quite a bit stronger than the majority sites. (40) <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C NMR study from a pulse-quench NMR study of the acidity probe acetone-<highlight><bold>2-</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C on HSAPO-34. Most of the acid sites form a complex with a <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C isotropic shift of 217 ppm, and this complex is weakly absorbed at high temperatures. For comparison, the aluminosilicate zeolite HZSM-5 induces a larger shift, 223 ppm, in its adsorption complex of acetone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> On the pulse-quench reactor, a second complex, shown by other studies to be present at a few percent of total acid sites, is selectively retained, and yields a resonance at 226 ppm, suggesting a much stronger acid strength. The most plausible explanation for the second site is that it results from over-substitution of silicon into the framework, producing silicious islands with acid strengths closer to those of aluminosilicate zeolites rather than silico-aluminophosphates. Considering each nano-cage to be equivalent may be an oversimplification because a small minority clearly have stronger acid sites than the others. These second type of sites can likely be eliminated through more careful synthetic control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the case of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>SAPO-34, there are several non-equivalent ways to create two acid sites per nano-cage. Thus, materials with diverse acid site strengths can be obtained. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a feed containing an oxygenate is contacted in a reaction zone of a reactor apparatus with the molecular sieve catalyst of the invention at process conditions effective to produce light olefins, i.e., an effective temperature, pressure, WHSV (weight hour space velocity) and, optionally, an effective amount of diluent, correlated to produce light olefins. Usually, the oxygenate feed is contacted with the catalyst when the oxygenate is in a vapor phase. Alternately, the process may be carried out in a liquid or a mixed vapor/liquid phase. When the process is carried out in a liquid phase or a mixed vapor/liquid phase, different conversions and selectivities of feed-to-product may result depending upon the catalyst and reaction conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Olefins can generally be produced at a wide range of temperatures. An effective operating temperature range can be from about 200&deg; C. to 700&deg; C. At the lower end of the temperature range, the formation of the desired olefin products may become markedly slow. At the upper end of the temperature range, the process may not form an optimum amount of i product. An operating temperature of at least 300&deg; C., and up to 500&deg; C. is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Owing to the nature of the process, it may be desirable to carry out the process of the present invention by use of the molecular sieve catalysts in a dynamic bed system or any system of a variety of transport beds rather than in a fixed bed system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The conversion of oxygenates to produce light olefins may be carried out in a variety of catalytic reactors, including, but not limited to, fluid bed reactors and concurrent riser reactors as described in &ldquo;Free Fall Reactor,&rdquo; Fluidization Engineering, D. Kunii and O. Levenspiel, Robert E. Krieger Publishing Co. NY, 1977, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Additionally, countercurrent free fall reactors may be used in the conversion process. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,068,136 and &ldquo;Riser Reactor&rdquo;, Fluidization and Fluid-Particle Systems, pages 48-59, F. A. Zenz and D. F. Othmo, Reinhold Publishing Corp., NY 1960, the descriptions of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Any standard commercial scale reactor system can be used, including fixed bed or moving bed systems. The commercial scale reactor systems can be operated at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of from 1 hr<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to 1000 h<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. In the case of commercial scale reactors, WHSV is defined as the weight of hydrocarbon in the feed per hour per weight of silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve content of the catalyst. The hydrocarbon content will be oxygenate and any hydrocarbon which may optionally be combined with the oxygenate. The silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve content is intended to mean only the silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve portion that is contained within the catalyst. This excludes components such as binders, diluents, inerts, rare earth components, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Preferred reactors are co-current riser reactors and short contact time countercurrent free-fall reactors. In these preferred reactors, an oxygenate feedstock is preferably contacted with a molecular sieve catalyst at a WHSV of at least about 20 hr<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, preferably in the range of from about 20 hr<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to 1000 hr<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, and most preferably in the range of from about 20 hr<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>to 500 hr<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The pressure also may vary over a wide range, including autogenous pressures. Effective pressures may be in, but are not necessarily limited to, pressures of from about 0.1 kPa to about 4 MPa. Preferred pressures are in the range of about 6.9 kPa to about 2 MPa, with the most preferred range being of from about 48 kPa to about 0.34 MPa. The foregoing pressures are exclusive of any oxygen depleted diluent, and thus, refer to the partial pressure of the oxygenate compounds and/or mixtures thereof with feedstock. At the lower and upper end of the foregoing pressure ranges, the rate of selectivity, conversion and/or reaction may not be optimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> One or more oxygen depleted diluents may be present in the feedstock, for example, in an amount of from 1 to 99 molar percent, based on the total number of moles of all feed and diluent components fed to the reaction zone (or catalyst). Typical diluents include, but are not necessarily limited to helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water, paraffins, alkanes (especially methane, ethane, and propane), alkylenes, aromatic compounds, and mixtures thereof The preferred diluents are water and nitrogen. Water can be injected in either liquid or vapor form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The process may be carried out in a batch, semi-continuous or continuous fashion. The process can be conducted in a single reaction zone or a number of reaction zones arranged in series or in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The level of conversion of the oxygenates can be maintained to reduce the level of unwanted by-products. Conversion can also be maintained sufficiently high to avoid the need for commercially unacceptable levels of recycling of unreacted feeds. A reduction in unwanted by-products is seen when conversion moves from 100 mol % to about 98 mol % or less. Recycling up to as much as about 50 mol % of the feed is commercially acceptable. Therefore, conversion levels which achieve both goals are from about 50 mol % to about 98 mol % and, desirably, from about 85 mol % to about 98 mol %. However, it is also acceptable to achieve conversion between 98 mol % and 100 mol % in order to simplify the recycling process. Oxygenate conversion may be maintained at this level using a number of methods familiar to persons of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not necessarily limited to, adjusting one or more of the following: the reaction temperature; pressure; flow rate (i.e., WHSV); level and degree of catalyst regeneration; amount of catalyst re-circulation; the specific reactor configuration; the feed composition; and other parameters which affect the conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> If regeneration is required, the molecular sieve catalyst can be continuously introduced to a regeneration zone where it can be regenerated, such as for example by removing carbonaceous materials or by oxidation in an oxygen containing atmosphere. In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst is subject to a regeneration step by burning off carbonaceous deposits accumulated during the conversion reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The oxygenate feedstock comprises at least one organic compound which contains at least one oxygen atom, such as aliphatic alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carbonates, esters and the like), and the feedstock may optionally contain at least one compound containing a halide, mercaptan, sulfide, or amine, as long as the optional components do not significantly impede the performance of the catalyst. When the oxygenate is an alcohol, the alcohol can include an aliphatic moiety having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Representative alcohols include but are not necessarily limited to lower straight and branched chain aliphatic alcohols, their unsaturated counterparts and the nitrogen, halogen and sulfur analogues of such. Examples of suitable oxygenate compounds include, but are not limited to: methanol; ethanol; n-propanol; isopropanol; C4-C20 alcohols; methyl ethyl ether; dimethyl ether; diethyl ether; di-isopropyl ether; formaldehyde; dimethyl carbonate; dimethyl ketone; acetic acid; and mixtures thereof. Preferred oxygenate compounds are methanol, dimethyl ether, or a mixture thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The method of making the preferred olefin product in this invention can include the additional step of making these compositions from hydrocarbons such as oil, coal, tar sand, shale, biomass and natural gas. Methods for making the compositions are known in the art. These methods include fermentation to alcohol or ether, making synthesis gas, then converting the synthesis gas to alcohol or ether. Synthesis gas can be produced by known processes such as steam reforming, autothermal reforming and partial oxidization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the olefins produced by the oxygenate-to-olefin conversion reaction of the present invention can be polymerized to form polyolefins, particularly polyethylene and polypropylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Processes for forming polyolefins from olefins are known in the art. Catalytic processes are preferred. Particularly preferred are metallocene, Ziegler/Natta and acid catalytic systems. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,258,455; 3,305,538; 3,364,190; 5,892,079; 4,659,685; 4,076,698; 3,645,992; 4,302,565; and 4,243,691, the catalyst and process descriptions of each being expressly incorporated herein by reference. In general, these methods involve contacting the olefin product with a polyolefin-forming catalyst at a pressure and temperature effective to form the polyolefin product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> A preferred olefin-forming catalyst is a metallocene catalyst. The preferred temperature range of operation is between 50 and 240&deg; C. and the reaction can be carried out at low, medium or high pressure. For processes carried out in solution, an inert diluent can be used, and the preferred operating pressure range is between 10 and 150 bars, with a preferred temperature range of between 120 and 230&deg; C. For gas phase processes, it is preferred that the temperature generally be within a range of 60 to 160&deg; C., and that the operating pressure be between 5 and 50 bars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> All of the publications which are cited in the body of the instant specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> It is also to be appreciated that the foregoing description of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and explanation and is not intended to limit the invention to the precise manner of practice herein. It is to be appreciated therefore, that changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention and that the scope of the invention should be interpreted with respect to the following claims. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention sets forth a model, method, database and system by which it is possible for sellers to provide product information to consumers through shopbots, while at the same time charging for price information. In a preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided a model for responding to a shopper&apos;s inquiry seeking price information on a product in a competitive marketplace, comprising: receiving the shopper&apos;s inquiry for price information on a product; searching for price information of advertised products matching the product for which the price is sought; assembling identified price information into a response to the inquiry, wherein the price of at least one product is withheld from the response; forwarding the assembled response to the shopper along with a cost for obtaining the previously withheld price information; receiving the shopper&apos;s agreement to buy the previously withheld price information; and forwarding to the shopper the previously withheld price information in exchange for the agreed upon payment of the cost for the price information. The search for the price information comprises a search of at least one database, which may include an electronic search on a global computer network. Moreover, the price information may be provided to the seller by a variety of known ways, including via a shopbot or directly via a seller of the product. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a business method in the field of e-commerce, regarding pricing information available to buyers and sellers of goods and services over a global computer network, the Internet. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Shopbots are programs that automatically search the Internet for information that pertains to the price and quality of advertised goods or services on behalf of consumers (Chavez &amp; Maes, In <highlight><italic>Proceedings of the First International Conference on the Practical Application of Intelligent Agents and Multi-Agent Technology</italic></highlight>, (1996); Eriksson et al., In <highlight><italic>Proceedings of the Second USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce </italic></highlight>(1996); Kephart et al., in <highlight><italic>Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Artificial Life</italic></highlight>, Cambridge, Mass., The MIT Press (1998); Kephart et al., in <highlight><italic>Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Cooperative Information Agents </italic></highlight>(1998); Kephart &amp; Greenwald in <highlight><italic>Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems </italic></highlight>(2000); Kephart &amp; Greenwald, A., <highlight><italic>Autonomous Agents </italic></highlight>&apos;99 (1999); and Tsvetovatyy et al., <highlight><italic>Applied Artificial Intelligence </italic></highlight>(1997)). In response to a consumer&apos;s expressed interest in a specified good or service, a typical shopbot can query several dozen web sites, and within seconds collate and sort the available information for the user. For example, &ldquo;shopper.com&rdquo; claims to compare 1,000,000 prices on 100,000 computer-oriented products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Shopbots deliver on one of the great promises of electronic commerce and the Internet&mdash;a radical reduction in the cost of obtaining and distributing information. The product coverage provided by a shopbot in just a few seconds, far exceeds the capability of a patient, determined human shopper laboring through many hours of manual search. Consequently, since the launch of BargainFinder, a CD shopbot, in June 1995, scores of shopbots have emerged. One of the more popular shopbots, &ldquo;mysimon.com,&rdquo; provides information about office supplies, groceries, toys, apparel, and consumer electronics, just to name a few of the items on its product line. In addition, &ldquo;acses.com&rdquo; compares the prices of books offered for sale on-line, while &ldquo;jango.com&rdquo; and &ldquo;webmarket.junglee.com&rdquo; offer everything from apparel to gourmet groceries. Another shopbot, &ldquo;DealPilot.com,&rdquo; gathers, collates, and sorts the prices and expected delivery times of books, CDs, and movies offered for sale on-line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The study of the economics of information was launched in the seminal work of Stigler, <highlight><italic>Journal of Political Economy, </italic></highlight>69(3):213-225 (1961). Stigler cites several examples of observed price dispersion, which he attributes to the costly search procedures that consumers face. Consequently, he notes the utility of trade journals and organizations that specialize in the collection and dissemination of product information, such as <highlight><italic>Consumer Reports</italic></highlight>, participate in localized markets rather than search for buyers individually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Arguably, one of the first strategic-pricing economic agents with similarities to modem shopbots started operation in 1975, when US Congress declared the creation of a national market system, responsible for the joint dissemination of stock price data from US stock exchanges. The system permitted brokers to compare stock price data across the participating stock exchanges before placing an order, thereby assuring that they were trading at the best price. This data dissemination arrangement, under the Consolidated Tape Association (&ldquo;CTA&rdquo;) and Consolidated Quotation (&ldquo;CQ&rdquo;) Plans, produced a source of price information with many similarities to modem shopbots. Securities were perceived to be undifferentiated products by investors who equally trusted the participating stock exchanges. Consequently, the study of the CTA and CQ plans provides valuable intuition about the future of today&apos;s nascent Internet markets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the original stock exchange system, data made available by the markets that trade New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)-listed securities (&ldquo;Network A&rdquo;) were gathered, and then sold to individuals or organizations at a price to which Network A boards had to agree, and SEC had to approve. The profits were then distributed among the Network A members according to their costs of providing the data. Technology considerations at the time made any other arrangement (e.g., markets selling the data individually) impractical. Arguably, the most useful piece of information included in the data was information regarding the price of the securities. Network A has been selling price information for a quarter of a century with a price based on cost, as opposed to one based upon the marginal buyer utility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Recently the New York Stock Exchange Board of Directors announced NYSE&apos;s withdrawal from the CTA and CQ Plans, with the intention of catalyzing a pro-competitive solution that will take advantage of today&apos;s technology (NYSE Press Release dated Apr. 10, 2000 in reply to a Securities and Exchange Commission&apos;s release, titled &ldquo;Market Data Concept Release&rdquo; (Buck, 2000)). NYSE&apos;s proposal was to allow individual markets to compete on selling market data to the public. Obviously, the price information for securities traded in NYSE is more valuable than any other market, because (due to higher volume) brokers are more likely to find a best price. NYSE expects a substantial revenue increase if it is allowed to sell price (and other) data to the public at competitively determined prices, naturally connected to the public marginal utility for the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Interestingly, it appears that the only alternative solution considered by the NYSE was for Network A markets to sell their data according to the &ldquo;Ramsey Pricing&rdquo; scheme, proposed by Frank Ramsey (<highlight><italic>Economic Journal </italic></highlight>37 (1927)). Ramsey prices depend upon both a firm&apos;s marginal costs, and the elasticities of demand for the services the firm sells. Demand for NYSE&apos;s price data would, of course, be quite inelastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Although the pricing factors involved in the NYSE are highly complex, what is shown is that price information can have significant value. Companies, such as the NYSE want to charge the real value of their price information. Furthermore, the historical stock price dissemination scheme, which covers the market&apos;s charges for price information by a fixed revenue that is almost exogenous to the market, does not reflect the economic value of the price information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Many economists have developed and analyzed formal models that attempt to explain the phenomenon of price dispersion. In the absence of shopbots and strategic search costs, a model of sellers&apos; price adjustment was studied by Diamond (<highlight><italic>Economic Theory </italic></highlight>3:156-168 (1971)), in which a somewhat paradoxical outcome arises: for any positive search costs, no consumers search and all sellers charge the monopolistic price. Bakos (<highlight><italic>Management Science </italic></highlight>43(12) (1997)) discusses the potential impact of reduced buyer search costs on the electronic marketplace. However, while the Bakos model allows for product differentiation, it does not allow for varying types among buyers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Others, such as Salop and Stiglitz (<highlight><italic>Review of Economic Studies </italic></highlight>44:493-510 (1977)) have studied the question of how sellers could make any profit at all in a competitive commodities market, because the traditional Bertrand equilibrium argument suggests that competitive pressures should drive prices down to the marginal production cost. They found that the costliness of discovering prices&mdash;a factor not taken into account in the traditional Bertrand argument&mdash;could make it rational for buyers to forego comparing prices. This in turn allows sellers to charge more than the marginal production cost. Potential sources of price dispersion in the electronic age, include for example, product heterogeneity, convenience, awareness, brand, lock-in and price discrimination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Today, shopbots serve as local marketplaces in the global information superhighway. Logically, the rapid flow of information will profoundly affect market efficiency, and the reduced economic friction will lead to increased competition among sellers, when compared with conventional markets of bricks and mortar retailers (Green, <highlight><italic>Business Week, </italic></highlight>71-84 (May 4 1998); Lewis, <highlight><italic>The Friction-Free Economy: Marketing Strategies for a Wired World</italic></highlight>, (1997); DeLong &amp; Froomkin, in <highlight><italic>Internet Publishing and Beyond: The Economics of Digital Information and Intellecutal Property </italic></highlight>(1998)). This is because the typical buyer would prefer to purchase goods and services from the lowest-priced, highest-quality dealer, if he can efficiently obtain complete and accurate information at a very low cost. As a result, in today&apos;s electronic marketplace, many vendors view shopbots as a means of attracting consumers who otherwise might not have known about them, or might not have thought to purchase from them (DeLong &amp; Froomkin, 1998). Some vendors even sponsor shopbots, by paying for the opportunity for their products to be listed on shopping sites such as &ldquo;shopper.com.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In their qualitative investigation into the ongoing emergence of shopbots, DeLong and Froomkin, supra, point out that, short of violating anti-trust laws, sellers will be hard pressed to prevent their competitors from sponsoring shopbots, and that the sellers who do not do so, will experience decreased sales. Looking ahead, therefore, it seems inevitable that shopbots will evolve into economic entities in their own right, interacting with billions of other economically-motivated software agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, the new Internet economy is far from frictionless, and considerable and persistent price dispersion exists (Brynjolfsson &amp; Smith, <highlight><italic>Management Science </italic></highlight>(2000)). This price dispersion is large enough to make price information valuable to consumers who are price sensitive and want to compare prices before buying a good or service. A question that naturally arises for e-tailers (electronic retailers) is: If this information is so valuable, then why is it provided at no cost&quest; In fact, the sellers&apos; incentives to start charging for price information cannot be overlooked. If shopbots, that provide free services and profit only through advertising, do not want to pass this cost to consumers, they will have to share their advertising revenues with demanding sellers. This will become an issue, particularly in markets in which high price dispersion might lead to the collapse of the free shopbot model or, more accurately, the constant cost model for these markets. In fact, the impact of agent technology on the nascent information economy remains unknown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a preliminary draft of an article entitled, &ldquo;Dynamic Pricing by Software Agents,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Computer Networks</italic></highlight>, Elsevier Publishers (in press), Kephart and Hanson calculate how much a shopbot could charge for price information, given that it can manipulate the buyer&apos;s cost structure. The shopbot extracts all surplus from the market. However, the analysis offers no information to show that a shopbot can sell price information, even though other shopbots provide it for free. In fact, it would seem to indicate that it cannot, since logically all buyers would prefer the free information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is increasingly clear, however, that there is a need in the art for sellers to have the advantages provided by shopbot sites, e.g., free product advertisement and brand awareness, while profiting from the price information provided to the consumer. Specifically, a method or system must be devised through which shopbots can adequately price their services to maintain profitability, while at the same time continuing to provide consumers with incentives to subscribe. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides, for the first time, a correlation between product prices and the information value generated by the price of the product to the retailer or e-tailer. These findings not only prove that the issue is important in e-commerce, but it provides data that will influence the structure of future Internet markets. The present invention sets forth a model, method, database and system by which it is possible for sellers to provide free product information to consumers through shopbots, while at the same time charging for price information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The fundamental difference between the method provided by the present invention over that of the prior art is that in the preferred embodiment the buyers can be charged by sellers for price information, when they choose to compare prices with the help of a shopbot. This is primarily because a seller can manipulate his own product price, and subsequently the information value that it generates, but a shopbot cannot. In fact, the invention has proven to be profitable, while withstanding competition. Moreover, it is not limited to a particular pricing scheme. Not only can the pricing scheme exemplified in the present invention be used to effectively set the price for price information, but the disclosed methods are effective when applied to the pricing scheme of Kephart and Hanson (in press, supra), as well as to other pricing schemes. In fact, the Kephart and Hanson pricing scheme can be used in the method of the invention to help sellers set the prices they charge for price information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided a method for responding to a shopper&apos;s inquiry seeking price information on a product in a competitive marketplace, comprising: receiving the shopper&apos;s inquiry for price information on a product; searching for price information of advertised products matching the product for which the price is sought; assembling identified price information into a response to the inquiry, wherein the price of at least one product is withheld from the response; forwarding the assembled response to the shopper along with a cost for obtaining the previously withheld price information; receiving the shopper&apos;s agreement to buy the previously withheld price information; and forwarding to the shopper the previously withheld price information in exchange for the agreed upon payment of the cost for the price information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The search for the price information comprises a search of at least one database, which may include an electronic search on a global computer network. The price information may be provided to the seller by a variety of known ways, including via a shopbot or directly via a seller of the product. However, the product price information is ultimately purchased from a seller of the product. A shopbot may also purchase the price information from the seller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is further provided that the shopper expresses agreement to pay the cost for obtaining the previously withheld price information by methods recognized by an electronic device, selected from the group consisting of clicking or pressing a button on a computer or communications device, following a link displyed on a web page on a global computer network, touching a designated point on a screen or display panel attached to a computer or communications device, and speaking a selection into an audio receiver attached to a computer or communications device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention there is also provided a database on a computer readable medium for facilitating a response to a shopper&apos;s inquiry seeking price information on a product in a competitive marketplace, wherein the price information is provided to the shopper for a fee, comprising a number of data objects, and whereby any of the data objects are instantiated in order to populate the database. The objects comprise information such as, but not limited to, a field for entering an inquiry asking for price information of a product; a field for searching for price information of advertised products; a field for assembling product price information into a response, wherein the price of at least one product is withheld from the response, and wherein a cost is provided whereby the withheld price will be provided; a field for receiving an agreement to buy the previously withheld price information, and; a field for forwarding the previously withheld price information in exchange for the agreed upon payment of the cost for the price information. One or more objects may also provide data source(s) for additional objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In addition, in a preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided a system for accessing a database for facilitating a response to a shopper&apos;s inquiry seeking price information on a product in a competitive marketplace, wherein the price information is provided to the shopper for a fee, comprising a number of objects, whereby the system for accessing the database comprises means for viewing any or all of said objects. The system provides means for receiving the shopper&apos;s inquiry for price information on a product; means for searching for price information of advertised products matching the product for which the price is sought; means for assembling identified price information into a response to the inquiry, wherein the price of at least one product is withheld from the response; means for forwarding the assembled response to the shopper along with a cost for obtaining the previously withheld price information; means for receiving the shopper&apos;s agreement to buy the previously withheld price information; and means for forwarding to the shopper the previously withheld price information in exchange for the agreed upon payment of the cost for the price information. The system may comprise a network based apparatus, or it may, at least in part, comprise a first apparatus in a client-server relationship with a second apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description, examples and figures which follow, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art on examination of the following, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method by which sellers can benefit from the advantages provided by shopbot sites, in terms of product information, advertisement and brand awareness, while profiting from the price information provided to the buyer. Knowledge of the seller&apos;s competitive price information has value, for which the consumer will pay, so long as the cost of learning the price remains less than the cost of obtaining it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> For example, suppose that a buyer wanted to purchase the book, <highlight><italic>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone </italic></highlight>(list price $16.95). If the buyer were to drive to two or three local bookstores, it could take at least an hour or two to find and purchase the cheapest available copy of the book, and the savings would almost certainly not justify the time and expense of shopping. The shopping time could be reduced to perhaps fifteen minutes by contacting the same bookstores by telephone, or even to only five minutes by checking the Internet at &ldquo;amazon.com,&rdquo; &ldquo;bn.com&rdquo; (the online outlet for Barnes &amp; Noble), and &ldquo;borders.com.&rdquo; In fact, one would currently find that each is offering the book for the same cost of $11.99. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> However, if the same buyer were to use a shopbot for book at, for example, DealPilot.com, and specify <highlight><italic>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone</italic></highlight>, within twenty seconds a table of roughly fifty combinations of booksellers and shipping options would appear, presented in order from least to most expensive. At the top of the list, is &ldquo;half.com&rdquo; offering the used book for just $7.50&mdash;a savings of $9.45 (equal to a savings of 56% over the list price of the book), while &ldquo;elgrande.com&rdquo; offers the same new book for $10.23 (equal to a savings of 40% over list), which is still a savings of $1.76 (15%) over the bn.com price&mdash;all for less than one minute&apos;s work. A savings of time and cost, which many consumers would consider to be worthwhile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is inevitable that humans will not be able to keep up with the demands of responsive pricing on the millions of goods and services available electronically. As an increasing number of buyers begin to avail themselves of shopbots, and as shopbots become more pervasive and powerful, one of the frictional forces that has sustained profits for sellers in commodities markets will be reduced substantially. Price-aware buyers will become price-sensitive buyers, and they will force sellers to become extremely responsive in their pricing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The methods and system of the present invention are defined by a model of a commodity market, wherein people shop through shopbot sites to derive the optimal pricing scheme for price information. To better understand this concept, the scenario is exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in which more that one seller starts selling price information and find that the seller offering the lowest product-price might eventually lowering his total revenues (product sales plus price information sales revenues), unless he sets his price by also taking the second lowest price in account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In general, the process by which the potential buyer receives product price information contains the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> 1. The buyer specifies the product he/she is interested in. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> 2. The shopbot searches for the specified product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> 3. The shopbot answers with information concerning the existence and/or specific product information, but withholds the price of one or more products that match the buyer-specified criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> 4. The buyer specifies that he/she is willing to buy price information on one or more products for which the price or prices have not been revealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> 5. The shopbot provides the requested price information for a fee. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Of course, these steps are subject to modification according to specific situations without departing from the intent of the invention, as would be readily recognized by those skilled in the art. For example, Step 1 can be eliminated if the product or service the potential buyer requires is implied; Step 2 can either involve a request to the sellers for product and price information, or a search in the shopbot&apos;s database that contains product and price information; Step 2 can also include the shopbot&apos;s purchasing of product and price information from the seller; in Step 3, the shopbot can withhold product price information in a variety of ways. In each of these variations, there is a common theme, i.e., the buyer understands that he/she will need to request that information and accept the fees and terms associated with it. In Step 4, the buyer can specify the product price information he/she wants in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, clicking or pressing a button in a computer or communication device, following a link displayed on a web-page, touching a point on a screen or display, or orally dictating his/her selection. In Step 5, the fee is not limited to monetary payment, it can in the alternative be an indirect compensation, such as the buyer must watch a banner ad, or a commercial advertisement. ps 1.0 A Model of a Shopbot-Mediated Commodity Market </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Far from following the Bertrand view of the markets, where prices are driven down to marginal cost, products sold on the Internet demonstrate a significant and persistent price dispersion. Such price dispersion results from a complex interaction in the marketplace of product heterogeneity, convenience, consumer awareness, brand, lock-in and price discrimination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, it is assumed for simplicity that price dispersion on the Internet exists due to the presence of multiple classes of consumers that value products in different ways and demonstrate distinct shopping behaviors. The sellers have optimized their capabilities by selecting a price for their products that maximizes their revenues across all classes of consumers. Further, it is assumed that among such consumers is a distinct class comprising shopbot users, who buy products based only on price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> However, in order to present a closed model to define this invention, some additional discussion and assumptions are needed. A first question arises as to why sellers would provide price information for a product for which they know they do not offer the lowest price. Even though, under the instant assumptions, sellers will never make a sale through a shopbot unless they offer their lowest price, such sellers are indifferent in providing this information. This is because, even if the seller denies it, he will not make a sale. Nevertheless, by displaying his pricing information on a shopbot site, the seller increases its brand recognition among consumers. Furthermore, a seller choosing to sell his price information might make additional revenues from the shopbot, even though the seller will not make a sale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> For example, if one were to consider a market comprising sellers that sell many, diverse, undifferentiated goods, such as books, CDs, electronics, etc, one class of sellers could represent bookstores that sell many different books, but each book is a commodity product across all sellers, uniquely identified by its ISBN. It is assumed that product prices follow a random distribution (f(x)), with the equivalent cumulative distribution denoted by (F(x)), constant across the time period relevant to a buyer&apos;s shopping session, which is exogenous to the present model. (Although this assumption is significant when deriving analytical results, it is not essential to prove that the disclosed business model is profitable. For example, a buyer can be convinced to buy price information, even if that buyer has no knowledge of the price distribution. In fact, even if this were a problem, the shopbot could simply provide the buyer with information regarding the price dispersion relating to the product that the buyer wants.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A prospective buyer may know the distribution of the prices in the market, but he may not know which seller offers the cheapest price for the particular product in which he is interested. In the instant model, it is assumed that the buyer has no preference for a particular seller, and he is willing to buy from the seller offering the lowest price. For this reason, he will be willing to shop through a shopbot site that displays the prices of all sellers in the market for the products specified by the buyers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in the present model, seller (j) decides to sell his price information and contracts the shopbot to deliver all product information for free, except price, which will be available at an additional fee. The buyer will have to click on a button or a link and get j&apos;s price immediately by paying a price (p). Such a hypothetical agreement between Bookfinder.com and Fatbrain.com is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the shopbot Bookfinder.com was queried for a particular edition of Umberto Eco&apos;s <highlight><italic>Name of the Rose, </italic></highlight>7 sellers could be found that offered the book. Next, the appearance of the page was changed to remove used books and other editions of the book and also to remove the Fatbrain.com price from the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> There are three distinct entity classes in the relevant market: (i) the buyers, (ii) the sellers, and (iii) the shopbots. Each class faces a different problem, which is addressed in turn below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> 1.1. The Buyer&apos;s Problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The buyer has three choices: (1) pay for the additional price, (2) do not pay, but simply accept the lowest price among the remaining (N&minus;1) sellers without bothering to learn j&apos;s price, or (3) incur a fixed cost of inconvenience c, to visit the seller&apos;s website directly, which is assumed to be the same for all buyers. This inconvenience cost represents the time and effort to load a new web page, possibly learn a new user interface and repeat the query. Assuming that the buyer is rational, he will want to learn seller j&apos;s price, if he expects that the marginal cost saved by knowing the price is greater than the cost of acquiring it. Given that the minimum price for the good among the remaining N&minus;1 sellers is q, the buyer knows that the expected decrease in the minimum price from another search is: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&int;<highlight><subscript>&minus;&infin;</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>q</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>dF</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>x</italic></highlight>)<highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>x</italic></highlight>)<highlight><italic>dx&equals;g</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>q</italic></highlight>) &emsp;&emsp;(Equation 1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The integral starts from &minus;&infin; instead of zero to allow for negative prices. This is because only cost differences are relevant to the present invention, and de-meaned price dispersion data is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is assumed that the buyer is willing to pay j&apos;s information price (p) to learn j&apos;s price if p&lt;g(q) and p&lt;c. Therefore, if p&gt;g(q) and c&gt;g(q), the buyer will be better off by purchasing the item priced at q without requesting any additional information. Finally, if c&lt;g(q) and c&lt;p, the reasonable buyer will visit j&apos;s website directly to learn j&apos;s price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> 1.2 The Seller&apos;s Problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Seller j&apos;s problem is how to establish his price information to maximize his revenue. It is assumed that buyers have queried the shopbot site, and found that the current lowest price for the product they require is q, where q follows some distribution

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It is interesting to estimate how much an online bookstore would be able to charge for its price information to shopbots or shopbot users. Using internet book price dispersion data, including all costs (shipping, etc.), collected in Brynjolfsson &amp; Smith, 2000, and assuming that all books follow the same price distribution, the de-meaned experimental data is fitted with the normal price distribution, with mean zero and a standard deviation of 2. For the shopper session set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is representative case of price dispersion, described well by the normal distribution with standard deviation 2, the shopper would expect to get a E(f<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>(q)) discount from the average market price of the book of $11.49, when the shopbot quotes six sellers. Thus, the expected value for f<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>is &minus;$2.53, which gives an expected minimum price of $8.96. The expected gain that a shopper would have from knowing one additional price is p(&minus;$2.53), close to 9.8 cents. The value &minus;$2.53 comes from the discount from the average price the buyer has gotten, by comparing prices among six booksellers. Thus, the seller could charge just under 9.8 cents less for this book&apos;s price information, to make sure that rational shoppers would pay his price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A shopper could easily understand that it is worth paying for the additional price information. For example, a shopper looking at the website information depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, would immediately recognize that the lowest value can be $1.79 less than the second lowest price, even without requesting the extra price. If he expects to save $1.79 in one of every seven books, by acquiring one extra price quote, he would value this information at 25 cents. Of course, this is not the correct way that a rational shopper should value price information, but this example is used to show that the buyer can easily see the benefit of buying the extra price information in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The average revenue the seller would expect from selling price information in this market with seven (7) sellers is, based upon Equation 2, approximately 15.6 cents per shopper. This assumes that the shopper would never pay more than 50 cents to learn a price and would rather visit the seller&apos;s website directly. The arbitrary 50 cent maximum is based on a &ldquo;back of the envelope&rdquo; calculation for what 2 minutes of time is worth to the average shopper, given today&apos;s US salaries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> For 20 sellers, the expected revenue per buyer, as calculated by Equation 2 is 4.3 cents. In this market the seller&apos;s average revenue per shopper is $11.74/20&equals;$0.587. As a result, the 4.3 cents would be a 7.3% increase in revenues from sales made through shopbots. Thus, the business method of the invention, when employed in &lsquo;balanced&rsquo; markets, where all sellers are equally likely to offer the best price, brings a considerable increase in the seller&apos;s revenues, even in markets where many sellers compete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> If seller j prices his price information with the method suggested above, a rational buyer will always request seller j&apos;s price information. As a result, seller j makes the revenues described by Equation 2 every time a consumer uses the shopbot. Consequently, the seller makes additional revenue for every product sold in the market through a shopbot. These revenues can be an important percentage of the revenue the seller makes by actual product sales. A simple calculation for the seven book sellers shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is as follows: assuming that each seller is equally likely to be the lowest price seller, he would expect to make {fraction (1/7)} of the total shopbot book sales. For an average Internet book price of $11.74 (Brynjolfsson &amp; Smith 2000), the average revenue per shopper is $11.74 /7&equals;$1.68. Accordingly, the 15.6 cents would bring approximately a 9.3% increase in revenues from sales made through shopbots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it seems that the sellers are the group with the real market power. A seller that chooses to offer product price information to a shopbot, makes that shopbot more attractive to buyers, as it includes one extra price quote compared to other shopbots that do not receive the seller&apos;s price information. Therefore, the added information increases the chances that a price sensitive shopper will find a better deal. Accordingly, sellers benefit from selling this price information to the shopbot (or through the shopbot, directly to the shopper), thereby generating substantial additional revenue from a previously unrecognized income stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 1.3. The Shopbot&apos;s Problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A problem faced by the shopbot is whether or not to accept an arrangement with the jth seller. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, one shopbot, S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, may not wish to help sellers charge for price information. As a result, the seller may contract with another shopbot, S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, that will do so, in which case, a prospective buyer would have to choose between the two shopbots. It is assumed that the buyer can only choose one shopbot, since if he wants to visit shopbot <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and then after getting a minimum price go to shopbot <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to see if there are other sellers in the market, the model becomes equivalent to the model studied in section 1.1. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> 2.0. Selling Price Information Is Counterintuitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Selling price information on an individual basis in accordance with the present invention is a new and counterintuitive idea, and hence novel and non-obvious. Proof that the present pricing scheme leads to a profitable business model is fairly subtle. It is counterintuitive that a business model that introduces cost and inconvenience to the shopper (the shopper has to explicitly buy the price information for a particular product) can be profitable, as opposed to convenient methods, such as the ones currently employed (free or subscription based). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Current practitioners either provide price information for free, or use the subscription method, wherein a shopper, for a flat fee, has full access to all price information available at a web site. Because charging for information about prices is counter-intuitive, no one in the e-commerce market has considered the possibility prior to the present invention, even though there are important benefits, both theoretically and practically. The prior art offers no scientific literature on this topic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The present invention meets an unfulfilled demand in the world of electronic commerce. Sellers are known to block shopbot access from their websites. The most prominent case is probably the legal dispute between e-Bay and a number of auction aggregators that scan e-Bay&apos;s website to help their visitors compare auction prices. The present invention provides a solution to this dispute, as buyers could be charged to access e-Bay&apos;s price information through the auction aggregators. The fact, that this solution has not been implemented, further points to the counterintuitiveness of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> 3.0 Sellers Compete in Selling Price Information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Given the finding of the present invention that it can be profitable for a seller to sell price information through a shopbot, and that it can withstand competition from other sellers or shopbots, it is reasonable to expect that more than one seller would want to sell price information. For the purposes of calculation, a model is presented, wherein all sellers charge money to reveal their price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> For example, it is assumed that there is a shopbot that displays price information of N different sellers that sell many different undifferentiated goods. As previously discussed, product prices p follow a random distribution f(p) with the equivalent cumulative distribution denoted by F(p), constant across time, which is exogenous to the model. Shopbot users know the distribution of the prices in the market, but do not know which seller is the cheapest for the particular product in which they are interested. Moreover, they have no preferences for particular sellers, and they are willing to buy from the one that offers the lowest price for the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> 3.1. The Shopper&apos;s Problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the extreme case, where all sellers charge for price information, the prospective shopper would not be able to find any shopbot that provides price information for free. This would be true, unless the shopbot wishes to absorb the cost for the shopper, in which case the shopper&apos;s problem is trivial, since all price information is displayed for free (although as explained in section 3.3 below, it is noted that such a scenario might not always be feasible). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> However, returning to the present model, in which it is assumed that the shopper would visit the shopbot, where prices across sellers can quickly be searched and compared instead of visiting each seller&apos;s individual web site, which is a much more time consuming task. The optimal consumer behavior has been explored in the economic literature, reviewed, e.g., by Rothschild, <highlight><italic>The Journal of Political Economy </italic></highlight>81(6):1283-1308 (1973). The buyer would keep searching as long as the expected decrease in the minimum price for another search is less than what the buyer has to pay for it. If the buyer believes that all product prices follow the same distribution, the search would start from the prices that are least expensive to acquire. This assumes that if two price information prices are the same, the buyer would choose one at random. If the current minimum price is q, then the expected decrease in the minimum price from another search is a function of q and F as set forth in Equation 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Procedurally, the shopper would start by requesting price information on the products that is cheapest to acquire, and stop when the lowest price p requested by a seller to reveal price information is greater than the expected marginal product price decrease: p&gt;g(q). The optimal sequential decision rule is for the shopper to continue searching if the lowest price observed up to that point is greater than R, where R is the solution to g(R)&equals;p. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> 3.2. The Sellers Problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The seller&apos;s problem is presented as a game-theoretic analysis of the shopbot model, in which a Nash equilibrium is considered, assuming that sellers are rational (profit maximizers), and that shoppers are also rational (utility maximizers). A Nash equilibrium is a vector of prices at which sellers maximize their individual profits, shoppers maximize their individual utilities, and from which no agent has any incentive to deviate (Nash, <highlight><italic>Annals of Mathematics </italic></highlight>54:286-295 (1951)). In fact, as will be shown, there can be no pure strategy Nash equilibrium when sellers compete in selling price information, rather, there exist multiple subgame perfect Nash equilibria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the situation in which two sellers each set price information at the same price p, and when a shopper has to choose between the two sellers, the shopper will presumably choose one price at random. Consequently, one of the sellers can offer a discount, &isin;, to make sure that the shopper will always prefer his price information over that of his competitor. Naturally, &isin; can be chosen so that the decrease in price information revenue due to the lower price is smaller than the increase in revenue due to the higher probability of actually selling price information. Also, selling price information at zero cost is not within the considerations of the perfect Nash equilibrium, since a seller is always strictly better off charging a price above zero, rather than charging zero. This is true, even if everybody else is selling price information at zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Conversely, there can also be no equilibrium when sellers charge different prices for the price information. For the market to be in equilibrium, all sellers would have to be earning the same revenue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> When one considers two sellers S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>charging p<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, with no other sellers at intermediate prices, it is obvious from the model that S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, would be chosen with some probability &agr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, and S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>with &agr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, wherein &agr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&gt;&agr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The equilibrium assumption requires that p<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&agr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&agr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. If S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>sets price at p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;&isin;, then the new &agr;&prime;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, would still be greater than &agr;&prime;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and &isin; can be chosen arbitrarily small, so that &agr;&prime;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>(p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;&isin;)&gt;&agr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. As a result, S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>can always earn higher revenue by raising the price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> There are, however, multiple subgame perfect Nash equilibria possible in the infinitely repeated game in there are N sellers. Moreover, it can be assumed that when setting their own price information, the sellers do not know each other&apos;s product prices for the specific product for which the shopper is searching. (The situation wherein sellers do know each other&apos;s prices is considered below.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The structure of the scenario and the payoffs for sellers are set forth as follows when (i) two sellers S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>compete in selling price information, (ii) at each stage they choose price p<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, respectively, for their price information, and (iii) their payoffs have the following form: if p<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&lt;p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, then S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>will receive a payoff of p<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>a payoff of p<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>&int;<highlight><subscript>p2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&infin;</superscript></highlight>f(q)g(q)dq. The integral p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&int;<highlight><subscript>p2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&infin;</superscript></highlight>f(q)g(q)dq is simply the probability that after the shopper acquires S<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&apos;s price, the expected product price decrease by also acquiring S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&apos;s price, is less than p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. In other words, the integral summarizes the probability that S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&apos;s product price will be requested. For simplicity, it is assumed that the prices the sellers choose will always be less than c, which as previously defined is the cost for the shopper to directly visit a seller&apos;s website. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> If p<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&gt;p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the payoffs are symmetric. Moreover, if p<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;p<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;p, the payoff for both sellers is r<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>&equals;(&frac12;)p&plus;(&frac12;)p &int;<highlight><subscript>p2 </subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&infin;</superscript></highlight>f(q)g(q)dq, because each seller has &frac12; probability that he will be chosen first. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Given the preceding assumptions and proofs, the existence of the multiple Nash equilibria can be proven, and its properties can be derived. If the model had a Nash equilibrium with payoffs (e<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, e<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) for the sellers, then any other feasible payoff (x<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, x<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), with x<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&gt;e<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, by Friedman&apos;s theorem, would have a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium of the infinitely repeated game that achieves x<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, x<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as payoff (Gibbons, in <highlight><italic>Game Theory for Applied Economists</italic></highlight>. Princeton University Press, 1st edition (1992)). In the absence of a Nash equilibrium, e<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, e<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be substituted by the reservation payoffs&mdash;the largest payoff a seller can guarantee receiving, no matter what the other sellers do&mdash;(r<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, r<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), as shown by Fudenberg and Maskin (<highlight><italic>Econometrica </italic></highlight>54, (1986)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the reservation payoffs for both sellers are achieved when they price to maximize revenues, given that their price information will not be requested first. This is because the competitor can always undercut the price. The best a seller can hope for is to have the maximum possible revenue given that the competitor will undercut. It is assumed that the price that maximizes expected revenues, when the seller will not be the first to sell price information, is {overscore (p)}. As a result the reservation payoff for both sellers is r<highlight><subscript>{overscore (p)}</subscript></highlight>&equals;{overscore (p)}&int;<highlight><subscript>p2</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&infin;</superscript></highlight>f(q)g(q)dq, which is simply the price multiplied by the probability that the price information will be requested. Any payoff higher than this has a perfect Nash equilibrium that achieves it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> One strategy that leads to a Nash equilibrium is the following: given that both sellers price their price information at p, each seller would continue pricing at p, as long as the other seller has priced at p in all the previous periods. He would punish his competitor, at a cost, by pricing at zero from then on, if the competitor deviates. Thus, it is easy to see that the other seller would always be better off continuing pricing at p in every period, given his competitor&apos;s strategy. Of course, the price p must be such that both sellers&apos; payoff is higher than r<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>, the reservation payoff. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> One price, p*, that is guaranteed to have expected payoff at least as high as r<highlight><subscript>{overscore (p)}</subscript></highlight>, if both sellers choose it, is the price that maximizes both sellers&apos; revenues when they choose the same price for their price information. So, one Nash equilibrium is for sellers to follow the suggested strategy, pricing their price information at p*, with expected payoff for each seller r<highlight><subscript>p*</subscript></highlight>&equals;({fraction (1/2)})p*&plus;({fraction (1/2)})p*&int;<highlight><subscript>p*</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&infin;</superscript></highlight>f(q)g(q)dq. This is because each seller has a {fraction (1/2)} probability that he will be chosen first. The extension to N sellers is trivial, under some mild conditions described by Fudenberg and Maskin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The price p* that jointly maximizes price information revenue for N sellers is the price that maximizes &kgr;(p),

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> assuming that p is always less than c, the cost to the shopper of visiting a seller&apos;s website directly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> It follows, therefore, that the only price for which a Nash equilibrium can be shown to exist is p*, since it is the only price that achieves an expected payoff at least as high as r<highlight><subscript>{overscore (p)}</subscript></highlight>, when both sellers choose it. Furthermore, even if more Nash equilibria exist, the p* equilibrium is arguably the most probable, since all sellers know it, and it maximizes their average revenue from selling price information to shoppers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The above model is actually a somewhat simplified version of reality. In fact, the Nash equilibrium of the infinitely repeated game might present the seller who has the lowest price product with a dilemma, since it is not guaranteed that the buyer will actually want to know the seller&apos;s price. Equation 4 above describes the seller&apos;s revenues on price information only, but it does not include product sales revenues. To understand this situation, one could assume that although a seller has the lowest price for a certain good, the seller might end up not selling the product if the buyer does not request seller&apos;s price. The buyer would on average request only a fraction, &agr;, of the N product prices, in which 0&lE;&agr;&gE;1, which depends on p and the distribution of product prices f(x). &lsqb;&agr; can be calculated by using the model developed by Stigler (<highlight><italic>The Journal of Political Economy </italic></highlight>69(6):213-225 (1961)), inspiring future work on the economics of information. If g<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is the expected gain from searching for the price of i&plus;1, then the seller would search on average k times, where k is such that g<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>&gE;p&gt;g<highlight><subscript>k&plus;1</subscript></highlight>, given price p for price information. In other words, &agr; is simply k/N.&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Under these conditions, the seller who has the lowest price for a given product, and who would have captured all shopbot users had he provided price information for free, will now make only a fraction, &agr;, of sales. Product prices and profit margins are exogenous to the model set forth in the present invention, but it should be clear that the lowest product price seller might end up lowering total revenue (product sales plus price information sales) if &agr; is low enough. In addition, the seller would now have to reoptimize product price to account for the fact that only a fraction of the previously estimated shopbot sales are made. Even if this optimization would lead to higher overall profits, it might cause the seller to choose a price that is no longer the lowest in the market. This would simply propagate the seller&apos;s problem to the new lowest priced seller. Therefore, when more than one seller competes in selling price information, the only Nash equilibrium that is guaranteed to exist in strict terms might make the lowest product price seller worst off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> One solution to this seller&apos;s problem would be for sellers to price their price information low enough so that a rational shopper would always request it, even though the second lowest price in the market has been discovered. If the sellers know that the second lowest price in the market is q<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, then by charging &int;<highlight><subscript>&minus;&infin;</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>q2</superscript></highlight>F(x)dx&minus;&isin; for price information, the seller can be sure that they buyer will always eventually discover the lowest price. This pricing scheme can also be used when sellers have information on the competitor&apos;s product prices. In this case, all sellers would know that the lowest priced seller will try to guard product sales by making sure his price information price is always requested, and that such a seller will want to set his price to &int;<highlight><subscript>&minus;&infin;</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>q2</superscript></highlight>F(x)dx&minus;&isin;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Thus, a feasible, good strategy would be for all other sellers to match the price of the lowest seller. If those sellers try to undercut the price of the cheapest seller, then the buyer would know that they have done so. As a result, the reasonable shopper would know who was the original seller with the lowest price, as compared with the other product sellers, simply because the other sellers have undercut the original lowest price information. The buyer would not need to request any prices, and he could simply visit the cheapest seller&apos;s web site directly. Consequently, the other sellers would lose revenue if they attempt to undercut this price. Rather, there is an incentive to match the lowest price seller&apos;s price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> If all sellers charge the same low price, the buyer would have to request some or all of the prices to identify the cheapest seller. Other buyers can also follow a randomized strategy, but this would not provide any way to identify the cheapest seller of the product. Of course, this represents just one pricing strategy that works, without causing the cheapest seller to lose actual product sales. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, a seller is always better off, charging the low price described herein, rather than providing price information for free. Thus, according to the model set forth in the present invention, no seller should reveal price information for free to a shopbot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> 3.3.The Shopbot&apos;s Problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The shopbot that wishes to attract buyers might want to absorb part or all of a buyer&apos;s costs in searching for the lowest price. A popular shopbot model is free for users, and makes revenues by displaying an advertising banner. A shopbot that earns a fixed revenue per customer, and that wishes to continue providing free price information, would have to share part of that revenue with sellers who demand money for their price information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> It is clear from the preceding section that the expected cost per customer rises as price dispersion increases, i.e., as sellers take advantage of the higher shopper uncertainty about prices. This means that the shopbot that covers a market with smaller price dispersions would have better chances in managing to absorb the customers costs in searching for the best price. Shopbots in markets with a higher price dispersion might find it difficult to cover for the shopper&apos;s costs by allocating part of the fixed revenue simply by selling advertising. However, even shopbots operating in markets with small price dispersions can have problems absorbing seller demands. Shopbots could benefit from the present invention, and employ the methods claimed to satisfy the seller&apos;s demands for selling price information to buyers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, price information is valuable to shoppers who search for the best deal on the internet, because considerable price dispersion exists. This fact will not go away when shopbots become even more popular, because different shoppers have different values for the &ldquo;bundle of goods&rdquo; represented by, for example, a simple product like a book (one gets the book, fulfillment speed, shopping convenience, trust of store, etc.) Shopbots that acquire and compare prices offer a valuable service to price sensitive shoppers. The value of price information in e-commerce has been largely neglected by researchers, but this value cannot be overlooked and it could influence the form of some internet markets. Pricebots are a competing method that does not mix well with this invention, and they have serious drawbacks that are overcome by the invention. In fact, the invention helps the sellers acquire the value that their price information has, without sacrificing the buyer&apos;s wish to find and buy the cheapest product </paragraph>

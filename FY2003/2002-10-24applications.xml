<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An alternating electric field at an ice interface generates conductivity AC with a frequency greater than 1000 Hz in interfacial ice. Typically, a first electrode and a second electrode define an interelectrode space containing a stack of freezer packages. Each freezer package has an outer dielectric film and a continuous inner conductive layer coating the inside of the dielectric film. An AC power source provides a voltage of about 10 to 500 volts across the electrodes. The first and last freezer packages in the stack are proximate to the first and second electrodes, respectively. The AC voltage generates conductivity AC in the inner conductive layers. An alternating electric field between adjacent conductive layers generates conductivity current in the ice, resulting in Joule heat, which melts the ice. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Statement of the Problem </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Ice adhesion to freezer packages causes various types of problems. Food, medical and biological materials, and other materials often are stored below the freezing temperature of water. The material is typically stored in freezer bags and various other types of freezer packages. Water vapor that condenses in a freezer and water from other sources freezes between the packages. As a result, adjacent packages are stuck together by ice adhering to adjacent outside surfaces of packages. Individual packages frozen to one or more other packages cannot be moved individually unless the ice is melted. Melting the ice to separate the packages raises the temperature of the material contained in the packages. This often results in undesired thawing of food, or otherwise raising the temperature of a package&apos;s contents above an undesired or a critical temperature. Therefore, the package&apos;s contents may be destroyed or rendered useless. Melting all of the ice between a large number of packages in a freezer by raising the freezer temperature causes downtime and an accumulation of liquid water, which must be removed from the freezer separately. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention helps to solve some of the problems mentioned above by providing systems and methods for melting ice at an ice interface and for preventing the formation of ice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, a system for both preventing ice and for melting ice on a freezer package includes a first electrode and a second electrode, the first electrode and the second electrode defining an interelectrode space for accommodating a freezer package. In another aspect, a system in accordance with the invention includes an AC power source for providing an AC voltage across the first and second electrodes. Typically, the AC voltage is a high-frequency voltage, with a frequency not less than about 1000 Hz. Preferably, the AC voltage has a frequency in a range of about from 10 kHz to 30 kHz. In still another aspect of the invention, the AC voltage does not significantly heat the contents of the freezer package or melt bulk ice. Typically, the AC voltage has an amplitude in a range of about from 10 to 1000 volts, but the voltage is 10 kV or higher in certain conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, a system further includes a freezer package located in the interelectrode space. In another aspect, the freezer package has a freezer package wall with an outer dielectric film and a continuous inner conductive layer contiguous to the outer dielectric film. In still another aspect, a freezer package wall has a first portion proximate to the first electrode so that the AC voltage generates an alternating electric field between the first electrode and the first portion strong enough to melt ice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, heating of the contents of a freezer package is insignificant, amounting generally to less than 1 calorie per gram, and typically less than {fraction (1/10)} calorie per gram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, a system further includes a plurality of freezer packages arranged in a stack with a first freezer package proximate to the first electrode, and a last freezer package proximate to the second electrode, each of the plurality of freezer packages including an outer dielectric film and a continuous inner conductive layer contiguous to the outer dielectric film. A freezer package in accordance with the invention is useful for holding a variety of types of contents; for example, food and biological materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention further includes a freezer with a housing, and a first electrode and a second electrode that define an interelectrode space. Preferably, the first electrode is movable. In another aspect, a freezer system includes an AC power source for providing an AC voltage across the first and second electrodes with a frequency not less than about 1000 Hz, which AC voltage does not heat the contents of a freezer package. In one aspect, the second electrode is integral with the freezer housing. In another aspect, the second electrode is mounted in a freezer space of a conventional freezer or it is a movable electrode. In another aspect, a freezer system in accordance with the invention further includes a freezer package located in the interelectrode space. The freezer package has a freezer package wall with an outer dielectric film and a continuous inner conductive layer contiguous to the outer dielectric film. In another aspect, the freezer package wall has a first portion proximate to the first electrode so that the AC voltage generates an alternating electric field between the first electrode and the first portion strong enough to melt ice. In still another aspect, a freezer system further includes a plurality of freezer packages arranged in a stack with a first freezer package proximate to the first electrode, and a last freezer package proximate to the second electrode, each of the plurality of freezer packages including an outer dielectric film and a continuous inner conductive layer contiguous to the outer dielectric film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, a system for melting ice includes a first electrode and a second electrode, the first electrode and the second electrode defining an interelectrode space between the first electrode and the second electrode. The system may include a conductive layer located in the interelectrode space and electrically insulated from the first and second electrodes. In another aspect, a conductive layer is located proximate to the first or second electrode. In another aspect, a system includes an outer dielectric film that electrically insulates the conductive layer from the first and second electrodes and from ice and liquid water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a method for preventing ice and for melting ice. A method in accordance with the invention includes a step of generating a high-frequency alternating electric field that prevents the formation of ice or melts interfacial ice without significantly heating bulk ice, bulk dielectric material, or contents of a freezer package. The step of generating a high-frequency alternating electric field may include applying an AC voltage with a frequency not less than about 1000 Hz across a first electrode and a second electrode. Typically, the AC voltage has an amplitude in a range of about from 10 to 1000 volts, but the voltage is 10 kV or higher in certain conditions. Typically, a method in accordance with the invention is used to prevent ice or melt ice on and between one or more freezer packages or other objects, the bulk of which is dielectric. Preferably, the objects, such as freezer packages, are located in an interelectrode space between the first electrode and the second electrode. In another aspect, the step of generating a high-frequency alternating electric field in the ice includes generating conductivity AC in an inner conductive layer, the inner conductive layer electrically insulated from the ice and the first and second electrodes. In other aspects, the inner conductive layer is contiguous to an outer dielectric film, and the outer dielectric film is located proximate to the first electrode and between the first electrode and the inner conductive layer.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The invention is described herein with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that the structures and systems depicted in schematic form in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are used to explain the invention and are not precise depictions of actual structures and systems in accordance with the invention. Furthermore, the embodiments described herein are exemplary and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined in the claims below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Embodiments are described herein mainly with reference to freezer packages. It is understood, however, that embodiments in accordance with the invention are useful for melting ice in other, different applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A capacitor does not provide strong resistance to high-frequency currents. At high frequency, the capacitor has a low impedance. A capacitor subjected to high-frequency voltage acts virtually as a direct electrical connection between electrical conductors. Thus, a capacitor provides efficient indirect connection of a high-frequency voltage source to an electrical conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, dielectric layers such as thin dielectric polymer films are subjected to high-frequency voltage and function as thin film capacitors, providing efficient indirect electrical connection between successive conductive layers at high-frequency voltage. The potential difference between adjacent conductive layers creates a high-frequency alternating electric field between the layers. A portion of the electrostatic energy of the alternating electric field generates conductivity (resistive) AC in semiconductive interfacial ice located in the high-frequency alternating electric field between the conductive layers. The conductivity (resistive) AC in the interfacial ice causes Joule heat, which melts interfacial ice. The Joule heating power is:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> where W<highlight><subscript>h </subscript></highlight>is the heating power per m<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, &sgr;<highlight><subscript>i&fnof;</subscript></highlight> is interfacial ice electric resistivity, and j is the current density. Substitution of values for the resistivity of water and bulk ice into equation (1) yields an expression for the heating power in liquid water and in bulk ice, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Current density is proportional to alternating electric field strength, which can be expressed by the equation</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>E&equals;V/d</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> where E represents alternating electric field strength, V represents average potential difference, and d represents the distance between conductors having potential difference V. For a given value of resistivity, &rgr;<highlight><subscript>i&fnof;</subscript></highlight>, and for a given potential difference, V, the heating power, W<highlight><subscript>h</subscript></highlight>, is inversely proportional to d<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Thus, an increase in the value of d by a factor of 10, reduces the electric field strength and W<highlight><subscript>h </subscript></highlight>by a factor of approximately 100. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> in which &sgr;<highlight><subscript>i&fnof;</subscript></highlight> is interfacial ice conductivity, &rgr;<highlight><subscript>i&fnof;</subscript></highlight> is interfacial ice resistivity, and &sgr;<highlight><subscript>i&fnof;</subscript></highlight>&equals;1/&rgr;<highlight><subscript>i&fnof;</subscript></highlight>. There is virtually no potential difference between different parts of a particular food package because of the high conductivity of the conductive layer of the food package. Thus, the term &ldquo;V&rdquo; in Equation 3 represents the potential difference between two conductive layers of two adjacent packages in close proximity to each other. The distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; in smallest at the contact point or other regions of close proximity of two packages. In accordance with Equation (3), most of the heat is generated in such regions where the distance, d, is minimal. Typically, ice and frost &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; form in such regions of minimal &ldquo;d&rdquo;. Thus, in accordance with the invention, heat is generated mainly where it is most useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A method and a system in accordance with the invention also prevent formation of ice, particularly in a freezer. As water vapor cools and condenses on a surface, a thin layer of liquid water is formed on the surface. The conductivity of liquid water is one to two orders of magnitude greater than the conductivity of interfacial ice, and it is about three to four orders of magnitude greater than the conductivity of bulk ice. As a result, an alternating electric field in accordance with the invention generates conductivity AC in the liquid water, causing Joule heat. The Joule heating of the liquid water layer causes the water to evaporate from the surface, thereby preventing the formation of ice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The electrical conductivity of ice increases as the frequency of the alternating electric field increases. As conductivity, &sgr;<highlight><subscript>if</subscript></highlight>, increases, the heating power, W<highlight><subscript>h</subscript></highlight>, also increases, in accordance with Equation (3). At high frequency (e.g., 10-30 kHz), interfacial ice is about 1000 times more conductive than at low frequency (50-200 Hz). As a result, for given field strength, V/d, the amount of heating power generated at high frequency is greater than at low frequency. Deicing in accordance with the invention occurs at AC frequencies as low as about 100 Hz; however, such low frequencies require high voltage. Therefore, the frequency of the alternating electric field and the AC voltage usually exceeds 1 kHz, and is preferably 10 kHz or greater. While other considerations may limit practically the frequency, from a heating standpoint, the frequency should be as high as possible. With high-frequency AC, that is, not less than about 1000 Hz (1 kHz), an AC voltage in a range of about from 2 volts to 10 volts per layer of ice is usually sufficient to melt ice in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An advantage of a system and a method in accordance with the invention, as compared to conventional heaters, is that the heating power, W<highlight><subscript>h</subscript></highlight>, is generated directly where it is needed; that is, in the ice between freezer packages. Power is practically not applied to the bulk ice or to the contents of the packages. Also, virtually no power sinks into the environment. This reduces total energy consumption. Another advantage is that the contents of the freezer packages are not heated. As a result, undesired thawing of food or heating of heat-sensitive contents of freezer packages is avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In typical embodiments in accordance with the invention, a thin dielectric polymer film separates an electrode at a given voltage from a conductive layer in a freezer package adjacent to the electrode. Typically, a conductive layer in a freezer package is a continuous metallized coating. Typically, a conductive layer is part of a laminate structure of a freezer package. For example, a typical freezer package used in accordance with the invention includes a wall with an outer, dielectric polymer film and an inner, metallized conductive layer. Preferably, a freezer package wall also includes an inner, dielectric polymer film, which serves to protect the inner conductive layer against physical injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An electrode in accordance with the invention typically has a form of a metal electrode plate or a flexible electrode pad. Preferably, there is not much air space between an electrode and the first freezer package (or last freezer package) in a stack of freezer packages because air acts as a relatively strong electrical insulator, thereby increasing voltage requirements. The outer dielectric film of each freezer package functions as a thin capacitor subjected to high-frequency voltage, thereby providing efficient indirect connection between adjacent electrical conductors; for example, between an electrode and the inner conductive layer of a freezer package, or between the inner conductive layers of adjacent freezer packages. The conductive layer of each freezer package in a stack of freezer packages between two electrodes conducts AC, but typically at a potential that is between the voltages at the two electrodes. A system and a method in accordance with the invention is also useful for preventing ice and melting ice on a single freezer package or a plurality of freezer packages in the interelectrode space between two electrodes. Co-owned and co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/976,210, filed Oct. 11, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference, teaches generally a system and a method for melting interfacial ice in a high-frequency alternating electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Prevention of ice and melting of ice on a freezer package and between freezer packages in accordance with the invention is generally conducted using audio frequencies measured in kHz, for example, in a range of about from 10 to 30 kHz, and even up to several hundred kHz. In contrast, a conventional microwave oven operates with radio frequencies measured in MHz, generally greater than 100 MHz. Generating radio frequencies is much more difficult and expensive than generating audio frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A conventional microwave oven functions as a resonant cavity. A sufficiently strong electromagnetic field is achieved in a microwave oven only in the absence of conductive materials in the open chamber. If conductive parts are present in a microwave oven, the quality of the chamber degrades, there is no resonance, and therefore, no sufficiently strong electromagnetic field. In contrast, an apparatus and a method in accordance with the invention do not rely on resonance; rather, the strength of an electric field depends principally upon potential difference between inner conductive layers of adjacent freezer packages (or between an inner conductive layer and an electrode) and the interconductor distance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Containers used in microwave ovens do not contain a conductive layer because a conductive layer would interfere with resonance in a microwave oven. In contrast, the metallized coatings or other conductive layers of freezer packages in accordance with the invention are substantially continuous. &ldquo;Substantially continuous&rdquo; means that a conductive layer surrounds the contents of a freezer package and all of the various portions of the conductive layer are electrically connected. As a result, the potential is the same in all portions of the conductive layer, and there is virtually no alternating electric field present within the enclosed volume or contents of the freezer package. Since there is virtually no alternating electric field in the contents of the freezer package, virtually no dielectric loss heating or Joule heating of the contents occurs. Practically, a substantially continuous conductive layer of a freezer package typically completely covers the inside surface of an outer dielectric film of a freezer package wall. Nevertheless, a conductive layer containing distinct conductive portions that are electrically connected may also be a substantially continuous conductive layer in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;conductive layer&rdquo; and similar terms in the specification are used in two ways. First, they refer to a layer, coating or other structure of a freezer package with a conductivity in a range typical of a conductive metal or metal oxide, and which provides a continuous conductance path around a freezer package, and which is electrically insulated from the outside surface and the exterior of a freezer package. The thickness of metallized coatings in accordance with the invention is not critical. A coating may be relatively thin; for example, about 5 nm. Or it may be relatively thick; for example, <highlight><bold>200 &mgr;m. An inner conductive coating typically covers substantially all of the surface area of the inside of a freezer package wall; nevertheless, it need not cover all of the surface area as long as it provides a conductance path connecting substantially all portions of a freezer package wall. Used in a second, broader sense, the term &ldquo;conductive layer&rdquo; refers to both an inner conductive layer of a freezer package or an electrode. </bold></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Numerous factors affect the Joule heating power delivered at an ice-solid contact interface. These include, among others: ice purity (affecting conductivity); AC voltage; AC frequency; interconductor distance; area of ice adjacent to opposing conductive layers; temperature. The small interconductor distance typically has a value in a range of about from 50 &mgr;m to 10 mm, preferably not exceeding 2.0 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Melting of ice at the contact interface is usually sufficient for loosening a frozen stack of freezer packages and releasing the individual packages for easy movement because the surfaces of a package no longer adhere to the bulk ice between freezer packages. Conversely, the bulk ice no longer adheres to the packages, and if desired, the bulk ice can be easily removed in the frozen state, rather than in a liquid state. An advantage of a system and a method in accordance with the invention is that heating power is used principally to melt interfacial ice. To melt the interfacial ice at an ice-solid interface in accordance with the invention, substantially none of the bulk ice, freezer package contents, ambient freezer space or solid structures of a freezer housing need be heated above 0&deg; C., the melting point of ice. This significantly reduces heat transfer into the environment, compared with conventional ice-heating methods in which a heating element is heated to a temperature above the melting point. Very little power is consumed to melt interfacial ice in accordance with the invention. As a result, total energy consumption is minimized in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A method in accordance with the invention is useful for melting ice at virtually any ice interface because electrical conductivity of interfacial ice is higher than the conductivity of bulk ice. Even within ice itself, electrical conductivity is higher along grain boundaries of polycrystalline ice because impurities in the ice tend to concentrate at grain boundaries. At an interface between ice and a non-ice material, electrical conductivity of interfacial ice is higher than that of bulk ice because non-ice material attracts conductive ions in ice to the interface. In ice located between freezer packages, the thin layer of ice in contact with and adjacent to the outside surface of a freezer package wall is interfacial ice. The ice covering a freezer package and having a contact interface with air is also interfacial ice. Melting of interfacial ice at the two ice-package contact interfaces between adjacent freezer packages in a stack of freezer packages serves to release individual freezer packages. In this specification, therefore, the term &ldquo;interfacial ice&rdquo; generally refers to the ice at the ice-package contact interface of a freezer package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An alternating electric field in accordance with the invention may be produced using a variety of structures and techniques. For example, commonly-owned co-pending international patent application PCT/US00/05665, filed Mar. 1, 2000, discloses a system in which an alternating electric field is generated by flowing high-frequency AC through an electrical conductor proximate to ice being melted. This specification generally contemplates generating an alternating electric field by providing a high-frequency AC voltage across a first electrode and a second electrode that are electrically insulated from each other. Thus, the invention preferably utilizes a strong alternating electric field in the interfacial ice. The stronger the potential difference between the electrodes, the stronger the alternating electric field. The term &ldquo;electrically insulated&rdquo; and similar terms have their general meaning that there is no electrical shorting of electrically conductive elements. Accordingly, the terms also mean that there is no closed conductor path connecting a plurality of conductive elements to form a closed circuit. The electrical insulation helps to maintain the potential difference between conductive elements in accordance with the invention. It also prevents generation and dissipation of heat except in the interfacial ice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is depicted in schematic form a section <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of a conventional freezer with a freezer bottom <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, including three stacks <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of freezer packages in the freezer space <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the freezer. Stack <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes freezer packages <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Stack <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes freezer packages <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is no significant amount of ice on or between the freezer packages. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows section <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at a later time at which ice has formed on and between the freezer packages. Typically, ice forms from condensation of water vapor in air as the air cools in a freezer. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, ice <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is located between freezer package <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and freezer package <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Ice <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is present between freezer package <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and freezer package <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In addition, ice <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> has formed between freezer package <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and freezer bottom <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Ice is also present on and between other freezer packages located in freezer space <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Ice <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> makes packages stick together and stick to freezer bottom <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, making access to or movement of the freezer packages difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention for melting ice on a freezer package is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. System <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a first electrode <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and a second electrode <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. First electrode <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> define an interelectrode space <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> between the first and second electrodes for accommodating one or a plurality of freezer packages. System <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> further includes an AC power source <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> for providing an AC voltage across first electrode <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Generally, the AC voltage has a frequency not less than about 1000 Hz. Preferably, the AC voltage has a frequency in a range of about from 10 kHz to 30 kHz. Typically, AC power source <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> provides AC voltage with an amplitude in a range of about from 10 volts to 100 volts. Higher voltage, for example, up to 10 kV or higher, may be desirable in large stacks of packages or in very cold temperature ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> further depicts several stacks of a plurality of freezer packages with ice on and between the freezer packages. Freezer package stack <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> includes a first freezer package <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> proximate to first electrode <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Freezer package <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> is located adjacent to and below freezer package <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Similarly, freezer package <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is located adjacent to and below freezer package <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Last freezer package <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> is located proximate to second electrode <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and between freezer package <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Ice <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is located between first freezer package <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and first electrode <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Ice <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> is located between freezer package <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and freezer package <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. Ice <highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight> is located between last freezer package <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. First electrode <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and first freezer package <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> define an interconductor space <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight>. Similarly, other freezer packages proximate to an electrode define corresponding interconductor spaces with the electrode. Ice, air or combination of ice and air typically occupy most of the volume of an interconductor space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an exploded, cross-sectional view of the region <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> designated by the rectangle in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts contents <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> of freezer package <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and contents <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of freezer package <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the invention, contents <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of freezer packages <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, respectively, may be any material stored in a freezer; for example, food or other solid or liquid materials. Typically, contents <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> are moderately or strongly dielectric, so that they do not conduct significant electric current. But, even when contents are conductive, there is no heating of the contents because there is no potential difference within the contents of a particular package. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> further shows freezer package wall <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> of freezer package <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>.

Freezer package wall <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> includes outer dielectric film <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight>, inner conductive layer <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight> and inner dielectric film <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> further shows ice <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, which includes bulk ice <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and interfacial ice layers <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. Interfacial ice <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> is located at the ice-solid interface between ice <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and freezer package wall <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> of freezer package <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Similarly, interfacial ice <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> is located at the ice-solid interface between ice <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and freezer package wall <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> of freezer package <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. The dashed lines <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> indicate that there is no clear boundary between bulk ice <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and interfacial ice <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. The thickness of ice that melts in accordance with the invention is typically about one micrometer. The distance between inner conductive layer <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and inner conductive layer <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight> at any location is referred to as the interconductor distance. Inner conductive layer <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and inner conductive layer <highlight><bold>367</bold></highlight> also define an interconductor space, some of which is occupied by ice <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. For a given potential difference between adjacent conductive layers, the strength of the alternating electric field in the ice is inversely proportional to the interconductor distance. Therefore, it is desirable to minimize the interconductor space between freezer packages and between a first freezer package and a first electrode, or a last freezer package a second electrode. </paragraph>

System <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and a second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> that define an interelectrode space <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. One or both of electrodes <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may be integral with a freezer housing (not shown). Alternatively, one or both of electrodes <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may be mounted within freezer space <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of a freezer housing. Alternatively, one or both of electrodes <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may be movable within the freezer space <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of a freezer housing. System <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> further includes AC power source <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> for providing an AC voltage across first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. A stack <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> of a plurality of freezer packages is located in the interelectrode space <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. Stack <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> includes first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> proximate to first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, freezer package <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> adjacent to freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, and freezer package <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> proximate to second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and located between freezer package <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> has a freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>, which includes an outer dielectric film and a continuous inner conductive layer, as discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Similarly, freezer packages <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> have freezer package walls <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>, respectively, each of which includes an outer dielectric film and an inner conductive layer. A first wall portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> of first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> is adjacent to and proximate to first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Ice <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is located on freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> at first wall portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> between freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Typically, a thin layer of air may also be located between first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a portion of the inner conductive layer corresponding to first wall portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> is located proximate to first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The inner conductive layer of first wall portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> and first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are separated by an interconductor distance and define an interconductor space. A second wall portion <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> of first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> is distal from first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and is located adjacent to and proximate to freezer package <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, second wall portion <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> of first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> is adjacent to and proximate to first wall portion <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> of freezer package <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. First wall portion <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight> includes a corresponding portion of outer dielectric film and a portion of an inner conductive layer. As a result, the inner conductive layer of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> at portion <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> is opposite and proximate to the inner conductive layer of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>544</bold></highlight> at portion <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight>. The two opposite portions of the inner conductive layers define an interconductor space <highlight><bold>557</bold></highlight> and are separated by an interconductor distance. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, second wall portion <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> is substantially opposite and parallel to first wall portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. It is understood that different relative orientations are possible in accordance with the invention between various wall portions of freezer packages and electrodes. Typically, in a method in accordance with the invention, as explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an AC power source <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> provides a high-frequency AC voltage across first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. Generally, the frequency is not less than 1000 Hz. Preferably, the AC voltage has a frequency in a range of about from 10 kHz to 30 kHz. The AC voltage creates an alternating electric field in the interelectrode space <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. There is, however, essentially no electric field in the interior of the freezer packages. Each freezer package has a continuous inner conductive layer. The continuous inner conductive layer has substantially the same electric potential at all points. Therefore, there is no electric field within a freezer package, and the contents of a freezer package are likewise not subjected to an alternating electric field. For this reason, the contents of a freezer package in accordance with the invention are not heated. A potential difference does exist, however, between first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and the inner conductive layer of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> of first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. The inner conductive layer of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> is electrically insulated from first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> by the outer dielectric film of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>. A thin layer of air between first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> also insulates, if present. Similarly, the inner conductive wall at portion <highlight><bold>564</bold></highlight> of last freezer package <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is proximate to second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, but is electrically insulated from second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> by the outer dielectric film of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>546</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The outer dielectric film of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> at portion <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> of first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> is proximate to first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and acts as a thin film capacitor between first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and the inner conductive layer of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>. Generally, at high frequency, a capacitor has a low impedance and it does not provide strong resistance to high-frequency currents. A capacitor subjected to high-frequency voltage acts virtually as a direct electrical connection. Thus, a capacitor provides efficient indirect connection of a high-frequency voltage source to an electrical conductor. Therefore, when a high-frequency AC voltage is applied across first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention, it generates AC in the inner conductive layer of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> of first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the AC voltage generates a high-frequency AC in the inner conductive layer of last freezer package <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. By the same mechanism, high-frequency AC is carried from the inner conductive layer of freezer package wall <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> at portion <highlight><bold>554</bold></highlight> across the outer dielectric film of freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, and across the outer dielectric film of freezer package <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> to the inner conductive layer of freezer package <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. Arrow symbols <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> represent the flow of AC in the inner conductive layers and across the outer dielectric films of freezer packages <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> during one-half of an AC cycle. During the other half of the AC cycle, the AC flows in the opposite direction. At any given moment during operation, the total voltage difference between first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is essentially distributed along stack <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> of the plurality of freezer packages <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight>. The electric potential of each freezer package is essentially uniform because the inner conductive layer is substantially continuous about the package and uniformly distributes potential. Since the potential of an individual freezer package is uniform, there is no alternating electric field within the freezer package or its contents. As a result, there is virtually no dielectric loss heating of the contents. Whatever insignificant heating of the contents occurs is generally less than one calorie per gram, and typically less than 0.1 calorie per gram of contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A potential difference occurs between first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, between adjacent freezer packages and between last freezer package <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the invention, AC flows through each inner conductive layer, with a potential difference between inner conductive layers of adjacent freezer packages. The high-frequency voltage differential across each respective interconductor space generates a high-frequency alternating electric field. The semiconductive interfacial ice absorbs electrostatic energy from the high-frequency alternating electric field. This, in turn, generates high-frequency conductivity AC in the semiconductive interfacial ice. The AC flowing through the moderately resistive semiconductive interfacial ice causes Joule heating, which melts the ice. Thus, the interfacial ice converts a portion of the electrostatic energy into conductivity (resistive) AC, which generates Joule heat. Since the conductivity of interfacial ice is much higher than bulk ice, conductivity AC concentrates in the interfacial ice, heating and melting the interfacial ice. Since practically no conductivity AC flows through the bulk ice, there is insignificant heating and melting of the bulk ice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Preferably, first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is in direct contact with the outer dielectric film of first freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> (or with ice <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>) because air located between the outer dielectric film of freezer package <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and first electrode <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> has a strong dielectric constant. Air causes a voltage drop that is not useful for melting in accordance with the invention. Also, it is preferred that the interconductor distance between adjacent inner conductive layers or between an inner conductive layer and an electrode be minimized. Since the interconductor distance is relatively small, typically on the order of several millimeters or less, a potential difference of about from 2 to 10 volts per layer of ice (e.g., ice between two adjacent freezer packages) is generally sufficient for melting the corresponding interfacial ice. </paragraph>

Alternatively, second electrode <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> may be movable within freezer space <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> first electrode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is movable for forming a variable interelectrode space <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> between first movable electrode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. Freezer system <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> further includes AC power source <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> for providing an AC voltage across the first and second electrodes with a frequency not less than about 1000 Hz, preferably in a range of about from 10 kHz to 30 kHz. A stack <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> of a plurality of freezer packages and a stack <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> of a plurality of freezer packages are located in the interelectrode space <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. Stack <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> includes a first freezer package <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> proximate to first electrode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, and a last freezer package <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight> proximate to second electrode <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. Similarly, stack <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> includes a first freezer package <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> proximate to first electrode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, and a last freezer package <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight> proximate to second electrode <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. When a high-frequency AC voltage is applied across electrodes <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, Joule heat is generated in the interfacial ice between freezer packages (and between a first or last freezer package and one of the electrodes), causing the interfacial ice to melt, but with insignificant heating of the bulk ice and essentially no heating of the contents of the freezer packages. As a result, freezer packages that were previously frozen stuck in stacks of freezer packages can be moved easily, without undesirable heating of freezer package contents or bulk ice. As freezer packages are removed or moved within the freezer, the size and shape of the stacks <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> changes. Movable first electrode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> can be moved to minimize the air spacing between first electrode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and first freezer packages <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> in stacks <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, respectively. In certain embodiments, first movable electrode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is a flexible mat that conforms to the surfaces of freezer packages (or package) to minimize the interconductor distance between first movable electrode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> and the inner conductive layer of the first freezer packages in each stack. A movable electrode in the form of a flexible mat typically includes conductive rubber or a nonconductive flexible material coated with conductive metal or metal oxide. To melt ice located between packages lying at approximately the same vertical level, the first electrode in the second electrode are disposed to generate a potential difference between the packages. For example, ice <highlight><bold>729</bold></highlight> between packages <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is melted in accordance with the invention by mounting first electrode <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> on the left side of stack <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, and mounting second electrode <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> on the right side of stack <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Although the embodiments have been described principally with regard to freezer packages, the structures and methods herein described are applicable to the melting and the removal of ice in general, and in particular the removal of ice from the surfaces of solid objects. Generally, a method and a system in accordance with the invention is useful to melt or prevent ice on or between one or more objects, the bulk of which is substantially dielectric. In other words, a freezer package having an outer dielectric film and a continuous inner conductive layer is not necessary for the invention. System <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> includes a first electrode <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and a second electrode <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> that define an interelectrode space <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>. One or both of electrodes <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> may be integral with a freezer housing (not shown). Alternatively, one or both of electrodes <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> may be mounted within freezer space <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> of a freezer housing. Alternatively, one or both of electrodes <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> may be movable within the freezer space <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> of a freezer housing.

Typically, the AC voltage has an amplitude in a range of about from 10 to 1000 volts, but the voltage is 10 kV or higher in certain conditions. Object <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> is proximate to first electrode <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>, object <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> is adjacent to object <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, and object <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> is proximate to second electrode <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> and located between object <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and second electrode <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. Objects <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> may be, for example, chunks of ice, sides of meat, or any other object, the bulk of which is substantially dielectric material. Ice <highlight><bold>932</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>934</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>936</bold></highlight> on and between the objects and the electrodes comprise interfacial ice at ice-solid interfaces and at grain boundaries in ice. There is no significant heating of the dielectric bulk material of objects <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>. The relatively high conductivity of the ice at an interface, however, causes the ice there to melt.

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A macroscopic version of the Scanning Force Microscope is described. It consists of a cantilever under the influence of external forces, which mimic the tip-sample interactions. The use of this piece of equipment is threefold. First, it serves as direct way to understand the parts and functions of the Scanning Force Microscope, and thus it is effectively used as an instructional tool. Second, due to its large size, it allows for simple measurements of applied forces and parameters that define the state of motion of the system. This information, in turn, serves to compare the interaction forces with the reconstructed ones, which cannot be done directly with the standard microscopic set up. Third, it provides a kinematics method to non-destructively measure elastic constants of materials, such as Young&apos;s and shear modules, with special application for brittle materials. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FILED OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to improving the measurement accuracy of a scanning force microscope (SFM) and more particularly to determining the resonant frequencies in a cantilever such as is used in an SFM. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Scanning force microscopes are used in a broad range of fields. They can provide surface information at a very high resolution. A subset of SFMs utilize a flexible cantilever attached to a probe. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (Prior Art) shows one such SFM. The SFM includes a cantilever <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a tip <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which are manufactured as a single piece of, typically, SiN<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or C. The cantilever <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> measures about 100 &mgr;m in length, and the tip, made as regular tetrahedron, averages 10 &mgr;m in height. A transducer scans the tip <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> across the surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> under study and, meanwhile, the tip <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> interacts with the surface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> via a variety of microscopic forces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Tip <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> reflects a laser beam <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to a group of photodiodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The deflection or movement of the tip <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is measured by detecting movement of the reflected laser beam <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The function of the cantilever <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is to support the tip <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The tip <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> thus plays the main role of the microscope. The cantilever <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in turn, purports an ancillary purpose. However, any reconstruction algorithm must incorporate it as a pivotal element. A reconstruction algorithm converts experimental data into force information. More specifically, the sample rests on a vertically movable support. As the support moves, so do the tip-sample separation, and their interaction force. The objective of a &ldquo;spectroscopic&rdquo; SFM consists of retrieving the corresponding force-separation (that is force vs. tip-sample-separation) curve. On the other hand, experiments measure kinematic data. By means of the photodiode system and simple geometrical optics, the height of the tip <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as a function of time, z(t), is recorded through photodiodes <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Thus, any reconstruction algorithm reduces the kinematics into the force-separation curve. These two pieces of information are linked through the dynamics of the cantilever-tip system under the influence of the sought force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An earlier dynamics model that is still used extensively in analyzing data from an SFM is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This model This model assumes that the elastic properties of the cantilever may be lumped into an effective spring constant, k, and the cantilever-tip inertia is considered through an effective mass, m. By this model spring <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> connects with the tip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that in turn interacts with a surface. As the sample-holder platform <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> moves upward at constant speed v, the tip-sample separation changes, and so does the tip-sample interaction. Within this framework and, by using Newton&apos;s second law, the interaction is F(t)&equals;md<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>z(t)/dt<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;kz(t), where t represents the time elapsed since the platform started moving and, z(t), the tip&apos;s height is measured with the optical setup shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> While this model provides relatively good results, the accuracy of an SFM is limited by the underlying model. Improvements to this model are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,145,374 and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/545,570, both to Zypman et al., which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The interactions of a cantilever such as those used in a SFM are mathematically modeled as system having multiple resonant frequencies. Due to the small size of a cantilever actually used in an SFM, verification of any mathematical model are difficult, at best. To overcome that difficulty, a macroscopic cantilever is disclsoed along with effective methods of determing resonant frequencies of the cantilever system. According to one preferred aspect of the invention, the cantilever is on the order of at least one centimeter. Although the system is developed for determining the accuracy of mathematical models used in SFMs, preferred embodiments of the invetion may also be used to characterize the physical properties of materials such as Young Modulus. The methods may be used with britle materials such as ceramics or glass. In addition, non-linear elastic properties can be studied. This is of particular relevance in predicting the behavior of materials when performing as parts of mobile machinery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, the accuracy of an SFM is improved based upon multiple resonance frequencies of a cantilever system. The cantilever is composed of a material having a known Young&apos;s modulus, E, and the the cross sectional area, A, length, L, and geometric moment of inertia, I, of the cantilever are determined. The vibrational modes of the cantilever system are calculated based upon the following equations:

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As the force varies slowly with time, so does the deflection. This time dependence is explicit in Equation 6 to stress that measurements are made in time steps. This solution corresponds to a one-degree-of-freedom, simple-harmonic-oscillator (SHO) approximation of the cantilever with spring constant 3EI/L<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. As an approximation, it has several limitations. In particular, it will fail when the tip-sample interaction force does not vary slowly. Under those circumstances, it may be possible to excite vibrational modes on the cantilever and, consequently, a one-degree of freedom model will not be enough to determine the state of the system. In the quasistatic regime, on the other hand, one degree of freedom is enough because if z(t) is measured, then Equations 5 and 6 can be used to compute the entire shape of the cantilever. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> B. Generalizing the SHO Solution </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In order for the SFM to be of use in fast imaging, where a force-distance curve must be obtained for each pixel and as quickly as possible, for example in the study of biomolecular motion, the quasistatic solution must be revisited because it does not yield accurate results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With that in mind, we now generalize the previous problem by allowing for the cantilever to sense, not only a constant force, but also a gradient of the force-distance curve as the tip moves away or towards the surface. This will enrich the solution for the deflection u(x,t), by allowing the possibility of vibrations superimposed on the SHO solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Therefore, we write the force as:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In writing Equation 7, we assumed, as in the BC, that the force on the cantilever is applied on the tip at x&equals;L. Here Fs is the average force the tip senses at one location above the sample, and G is the derivative of the force-distance curve at that same position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> We write the solution u(x,t) to Equation 3 as the sum of the static solution and a superposition of normal modes:

The curve &bgr;(&zgr;) is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. There, the first three branches, corresponding to the lower three eigenfrequencies of the system, are drawn. For a given force-separation slope, &bgr;, corresponding to a horizontal line in the graph, there are three corresponding intersections and thus three frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> This illustrates a number of important features. For one, the first, or lowest, eigenfrequency is very sensitive to changes in &bgr;. Higher-frequency branches are not as sensitive. In fact, they correspond to almost constant frequencies, independent of &bgr;. Next, for &bgr;&gt;3 (&bgr;&equals;3 corresponds to the snap-to-contact point where the slope of the force-separation curve equals the spring constant, k), the real frequency coming from the first branch is lost. The &ldquo;frequency&rdquo; becomes purely imaginary, corresponding to a damping of the nodeless mode beyond the snap-to-contact point. In addition, the lowest frequency now is given by the intersection of &bgr;&equals;constant with the second branch of the curve. This means that the cantilever becomes stiffer. If &bgr; is seen as an order parameter, and stiffness the property under study, one can say that at the snap-to-contact point there is a second order phase transition. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> SFMs are by design very small. Typically, the cantilever extends on the order of 100 &mgr;m. Due to this small size, it is difficult to measure the accuracty of the above-detailed mathmatical model. To overcome this difficulty, a macroscopic cantilever on the order of at least one centimeter is used. Specifically, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the cantilever 500 measures 25 cm. Although this is significantly larger than the typical cantilevers that are used in SFMs, the physics is the same for both systems; both are governed by classical mechanics. Forces of quantum mechanical origin do appear between the SFM tip and a sample. However, the origin of the force does not affect the application of our algorithm. Moreover, once a force is applied, regardless of its origin, the behavior of the macroscopic cantilever as with a SFM cantilever evolves in accordance with classical pyhsicals. Thus a cm-size cantilever is a good realization of the system under consideration. </paragraph>

The block <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is in turn attached to an aluminum horizontal slab base <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, where electrical connections to the cantilever <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> are made. For mechanical isolation and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the base <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> lies on a cushion foam pad <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> excites vibrations in the cantilever <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The piezoelectric crystal is positioned near the base. An audio-frequency signal generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> drives the piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. Electrical connection between the generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> are made through a connection block <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> on base <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A second piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is attached to the free extreme of the cantilever <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Any electrical signal from the piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> is fed through a connection block <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> on base <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to an oscilliscope <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. The oscilliscope <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight> provides dual channels. One is used to receive the excitation signal from signal generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the other is used to receive the detected signal from piezoelectric cyrstal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. These two signals are plotted against each other so that any resonance frequencies that are propigated from piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> to piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> will generate a Lissajous <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 520</cross-reference> on the display <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> of the oscilliscope <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. In addition, the excitation signal from the signal generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is also fed to a frequency counter <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> To reduce noise, piezoelectric crystals <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> are buffered by teflon rings <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight>. Screws <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> pass through the associated transducers (i.e. piezoelectric crystals <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>) and through the teflon rings <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight> to engage treaded holes in cantilver <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> One preferred method of determining the resonant frequencies of cantilever <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is performed by scanning the signal generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> from low to high frequencies. If the excitation frequency is not a resonance, no mode is propagated away form the piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> to piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. When the signal generator <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> hits a resonance, a normal, extended, mode is excited which can be measured by the second piezoelectric crystal <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>. To detect that resonance, the signal from the first piezo is connected to the vertical channel of oscilliscope <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, and the signal from the second piezo is connected to the horizontal channel of oscilliscope <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. The oscilloscope is set to operate in x-y mode so that an ellipse is detected when the cantilever is in resonance. When such an ellipse is detected, the resonance frequency may be determined from the frequency counter <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> These detected values are compared to the theoretical values calculated in accordance with Equation 14, above. When the cantilever is not loaded, k&equals;0 in Equation 14. Thus, the predicted frequency values are related to &zgr;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, and can be rewritten as:

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A comparison between the detected resonce frequencies yields close agreement with the expected values. The detected resonance frequencies can then be used to determine an effective cantilever length and an effective spring constant, &kgr;<highlight><subscript>eff</subscript></highlight>. For example, for measured resonance frequenies of 62, 437, 1.24&times;10<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, 2.38&times;10<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, 4.19&times;10<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, 6.24&times;10<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, and 8.43&times;10<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, the effective length is approximately 22 cm and the effective spring constant is approximately 527 N/m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The accuracy of the above-described mathmatical algoritm can also be verified by appling a known force to the free end of the cantilever <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. For the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> spring having a known spring constant is used to apply that force. (The spring <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> is shown in ghost lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The value of that force may be easily determined by &verbar;F&verbar;&equals;(spring constant)&times;(deflection). Thus, the derivative of F with respect to the deflection is the spring constant which then must be equated with k in Equation 14. On the other hand the aluminum rod with dimensions L&equals;(20.5&plusmn;0.1)cm and r&equals;2.38 mm (with negligible uncertainty) has a nominal constant k&equals;(624&plusmn;9)N/m. Thus for each external spring, the right hand side of Equation 14 is known and the resonant frequencies can be found. </paragraph>

These models, in turn, for improved accuracy in measuremnts made using an SFM. Although the methods have been applied as directed to verifying the mathematical models described above, these methods may be used in a number of other benefical applications. Specifially, the methods may be used to characterize the elastic properties of a material having unknown properties. In this case, the subject material is made in the shape of a cantilever and its resonance frequencies are determined in accordance with the methods described above. From Equations 2 and 9 the Young Modulus can be determined. This characterization technique is especially applicable to britle materials such as ceramics or glass. In addition, non-linear elastic properties can be studied. This is of particular relevance in predicting the behavior of when performing as parts of mobile machinery. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A temperature sensing apparatus including a sensor element made of a magnetically soft material operatively arranged within a first and second time-varying interrogation magnetic field, the first time-varying magnetic field being generated at a frequency higher than that for the second magnetic field. A receiver, remote from the sensor element, is engaged to measure intensity of electromagnetic emissions from the sensor element to identify a relative maximum amplitude value for each of a plurality of higher-order harmonic frequency amplitudes so measured. A unit then determines a value for temperature (or other parameter of interest) using the relative maximum harmonic amplitude values identified. In other aspects of the invention, the focus is on an apparatus and technique for determining a value for of stress condition of a solid analyte and for determining a value for corrosion, using the relative maximum harmonic amplitude values identified. A magnetically hard element supporting a biasing field adjacent the magnetically soft sensor element can be included. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention relates to temperature, stress, and chemical telemetry using sensing elements remotely located from associated electromagnetic (EM) emission pick-up and processing units that, in operation, detect emissions from the element. The invention targets temperature sensing, sensing and characterization of localized stress conditions of a solid analyte, and the monitoring one or more corrosive. More particularly, the invention is directed to a novel telemetering apparatus that employs a receiver to measure the intensity of electromagnetic emissions from a magnetically soft sensor element, whereby there is no hardwire connection between the receiver and the sensing element, and the receiver &lsquo;listens&rsquo; for harmonics of the fundamental resonant frequency in order to carry out the temperature, stress, and corrosive monitoring telemetry. The invention is further directed to new telemetry techniques associated with the sensing apparatus of the invention, including: sensing temperature, determining stress conditions of a solid undergoing analysis, and sensing the presence or absence of, type, concentration of, or degradation caused over time by, one or more corrosive (such as chlorine) in a wide variety of environments. For example, the new apparatus provides a way to measure temperature, stress conditions, and corrosives, including: (a) sensing material degradation or localized permanent deformation (of single materials, composites, or laminates) caused by corrosion, temperature fluctuation, weather conditions, etc., thus, allowing for the identification of regions of actual or potential material fatigue and failure; (b) sensing internal or surface stress due to applied loads such as are experienced by construction materials (building or roadway), including repeated or prolonged exposure to a load, explosion, wind and weather conditions; (c) sensing temperature or corrosive concentration and/or type within a test sample or product packaging (during quality inspections/audit); and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The new sensing element structures and technique provide information about a solid analyte or an environment utilizing the harmonic response of EM emissions of one or more sensor structures made of a magnetically soft sensing element. Furthermore, a magnetically hard (MH) element supporting a biasing field adjacent the magnetically soft sensing element can be included to provide additional functionalities, including: EM background noise; element ON-OFF switch; and biasing field response, where needed, by selective response of the MH element upon exposure to chemical species. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As is generally well known, electric and magnetic fields are fundamentally fields of force that originate from electric charges. Whether a force field may be termed electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic hinges on the motional state of the electric charges relative to the point at which field observations are made. Electric charges at rest relative to an observation point give rise to an electrostatic (time-independent) field there. The relative motion of the charges provides an additional force field called magnetic. That added field is magnetostatic if the charges are moving at constant velocities relative to the observation point. Accelerated motions, on the other hand, produce both time-varying electric and magnetic fields termed electromagnetic fields. For general reference see the textbook, <highlight><italic>Engineering Electromagnetic Fields and Waves</italic></highlight>, Carl T. A. Johnk, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>Edition (1988). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Anti-theft markers/tags (electronic article surveillance, EAS, markers) generally operate by &ldquo;listening&rdquo; for acoustic energy emitted in response to an interrogating AC magnetic field, to sense the presence of an EAS marker. Sensormatic, Inc. distributes an EAS tag (dimensions 3.8 cm&times;1.25 cm&times;0.04 mm) designed to operate at a fixed frequency of 58 kHz (well beyond the audible range of human hearing). These EAS tags are embedded/incorporated into articles for retail sale. Upon exiting a store, a customer walks through a pair of field coils emitting a 58 kHz magnetic field. If a tag is still in an article being carried by the customer, the tag will likewise emit a 58 kHz electromagnetic signal that can be detected using a pickup coil, which in turn may set off an audible or visual alarm. More-recently, these tags are being placed in a box-resonator, sized slightly larger than the tag, such as the tags placed within a cavity <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a housing (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of Winkler et al.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Winkler et al. describes an electronic article surveillance (EAS) anti-theft system that operates by detecting mechanical resonances of magnetostrictive elements made of amorphous metallic glass METGLAS&reg; 2826 MB, to prevent or deter theft of merchandise from retail establishments. In response to an interrogation signal generated by energizing circuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the interrogating coil <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> generates an interrogating magnetic field, which in turn excites the integrated marker portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the article of merchandise <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into mechanical resonance. During the period that the circuit <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is activated, and if an active marker is present in the interrogating magnetic field, such marker will generate in the receiver coil <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> a signal at the frequency of mechanical resonance of the marker. This signal is sensed by a receiver which responds to the sensed signal by generating a signal to an indicator to generate an alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Anderson, III et al. discloses a marker <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) formed of a strip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of a magnetostrictive, ferromagnetic material adapted, when armed in its activated mode, to resonate mechanically at a frequency within the range of the incident magnetic field. A hard ferromagnetic element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> disposed adjacent to the strip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is adapted, upon being magnetized, to magnetically bias the strip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and thereby arm it to resonate at that frequency. An oscillator provides an AC magnetic field within interrogation zone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to mechanically resonate a magnetostrictive strip <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which has first been armed by a magnetized hard ferromagnetic element <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, upon exposure to this AC magnetic field. The sole object of Anderson, III et al. EAS marker is to detect the presence between coil units <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (interrogation zone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) of an &ldquo;armed/activated&rdquo; marker <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the event an activated marker <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> secured to a retail article is detected within zone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an alarm will sound. A deactivator system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, electrically connected to a cash register, can be used to deactivate the marker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Humphrey and, another reference, Humphrey et al. disclose a type of electronic article surveillance (EAS) marker which includes a thin strip or wire of magnetic material that, when exposed to an alternating interrogation signal of low frequency and low field strength, responds by generating a signal pulse that they state &ldquo;causes a regenerative reversal of magnetic polarity generating a harmonically rich pulse that is readily detected and easily distinguished.&rdquo; And while the Humphrey references recognize that high harmonics are detectable for the low frequency interrogation fields they use, once again, it is simply the presence or absence of the EAS marker that is of any interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Schrott, et al. describes a multibit bimorph magnetic ID tag for attachment to, and identification of, an object. The tag has one or more bimorphs comprised of a thin strip of a magnetostrictive material attached to a thicker bar <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of hard magnetic material. A shipping pallet, package, or product is tagged with the bimorph for later product identification. Schrott et al. indicates that a multibit tag could be programmed to generate a binary or other suitable code. In the binary code case, a certain frequency of an array of cantilevers can be assigned a value of &ldquo;zero&rdquo; or &ldquo;one&rdquo; and, if absent, it can take the opposite value. The Schrott, et al. ID tag is limited to coded (zeros and ones) identification of the object. If, in operation, a Schrott, et al. ID tag&apos;s resonant frequency (predetermined by size/materials) is not &ldquo;hit&rdquo; during interrogation due to some unexpected event/external factor (such as, its resonant frequency is changed due to a temperature swing, or due to reaction of the ID tag with a surrounding fluid), no response will be detected and an incorrect output code will result, thus, destroying the Schrott, et al. ID tag&apos;s function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Rather than working at a fixed interrogation frequency and simply checking for amplitude like the anti-theft EAS markers do to sense presence or absence of an active EAS tag or marker on an article for purchase exposed to an interrogation field, the novel sensing apparatus and associated technique of the invention looks to the harmonic frequency response of a magnetically soft sensor element for information about temperature, stress conditions of a solid analyte, or a corrosive of interest. Operating as a telemeter, EM emissions are obtained through remote query according to the invention, without direct hard-wire connection and without the need to ensure the sensor element&apos;s orientation in order to provide such information. In effect, the high-frequency and low frequency time-varying interrogation fields to which the sensor element is exposed effectively empowers the &lsquo;passive&rsquo; sensing element(s) of the invention, allowing for harmonic amplitude values of EM emissions to be identified. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a primary object of this invention to provide a telemetering apparatus for gathering information about temperature, stress conditions of a solid analyte, and corrosives within an environment or analyte, utilizing the harmonic frequency response of EM emissions from a magnetically soft sensing element upon concurrent exposure to high-frequency and low frequency interrogation fields. A receiver, remote from the magnetically soft element, is engaged to measure the intensity of EM emissions to identify a corresponding harmonic amplitude value, or series of values. A unit, such as a processor of suitable type, a computerized device having processing capability, and so on, is employed to determine a value for temperature, stress conditions, or corrosion (i.e., the value of interest) using the harmonic frequency amplitude value identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Advantages of providing the new sensing apparatus and associated technique, include without limitation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (a) Mode of operation&mdash;The invention can be used for one-time disposable operation (e.g., in the form of a kit, whereby the sensor element is embedded within a solid analye or initially placed within packaging) or for continuous monitoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (b) Versatility of use&mdash;The apparatus may be used for individual measurements or on-going monitoring of temperature fluctuations, stress conditions, or a corrosive to allow for observation of characteristics of a solid analye (whether a single material or a composite or laminate) such as concrete, mortar, tar, wood, fiberboard, particleboard, plasterboard, sheetrock, fiberglass, plexiglass, resins, and plastics (including thermoplastics, and thermoformable, and thermoset plastics), as the analyte reacts to some agent, load, or other event over time, such as observing material degradation or deformation due to corrosion, exposure to a single catastrophic event (e.g., explosion or earthquake), repeated loads such as wind or auto travel (in the case of tarmac on roadways), weather conditions, and so on, thus, allowing for identification of material fatigue or failure in a nondestructive manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (c) Simplicity of use/Speed of results&mdash;The new sensing apparatus can produce measurement results, real-time, on-site with relative ease. The monitoring technique may be used alone or coupled with other current analysis methods such as visual inspection (in the case of buildings, fiberglass components of aircraft, roadways). Sensing data may be gathered within a few milli-seconds, or so. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (d) Apparatus design simplicity&mdash;Reducing the number and size of components required to accomplish measurements/monitoring reduces overall fabrication costs, making manufacturing economically feasible, and adds to ease of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (e) Versatility of design&mdash;The sensor elements can be formed into many different shapes of various sizes; for example, the sensor elements may be fabricated on a small scale (a few millimeters) for use where space is extremely limited such as within small-sized sealed packaging or where embedded within a material, or on a larger scale (several centimeters). Several sensor elements may be incorporated or grouped into an array to provide a &lsquo;package&rsquo; of various desired information or multiple parameters by sampling or measuring EM emission simultaneously or sequentially. This enables several measurements to be made with sensor element structures in an otherwise complex environment (e.g., a temperature measurement may be taken along with measurements relating to the concentration/presence/absence of a corrosive). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Briefly described, once again, the invention includes a temperature sensing apparatus that includes a sensor element made of a magnetically soft material operatively arranged within a first and second time-varying interrogation magnetic field, the first time-varying magnetic field being generated at a frequency higher than that for the second magnetic field. Preferably, the second, lower frequency interrogation field is quasi-static, i.e., effectively operating as a dc (direct current) biasing field, selected to maximize the harmonic emission amplitudes measured from the sensor element in response to the higher frequency, first interrogation field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A receiver, remote from the sensor element, is engaged to measure intensity of electromagnetic emissions from the sensor element to identify a relative maximum amplitude value for each of a plurality of higher-order harmonic frequency amplitudes so measured. A unit (comprising a processor, or other data processing device) is employed to determine a value for temperature using the relative maximum harmonic amplitude values identified. In another aspect of the invention, the focus is on an apparatus and technique for measurement EM emission intensity from a magnetically soft sensor element to determine a value for of stress condition of a solid analyte using the relative maximum harmonic amplitude values identified. In a third aspect of the invention, the focus is on an apparatus and technique for measurement of EM emission intensity from a magnetically soft sensor element to determine a value for corrosion using the relative maximum harmonic amplitude values identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> There are many further distinguishing features of the apparatus and technique of the invention. The receiver can comprise an electromagnetic pick-up coil and associated EM emission detection circuitry such as a spectrum analyzer. The sensor element may be located within a solid analyte a component of which is a material selected from the group consisting of concrete, mortar, tar, wood, fiberboard, particleboard, plasterboard, sheetrock, fiberglass, plexiglass, resins, and plastics. The sensor element may be embedded within, located on a surface of, interposed between layers of, etc., the solid analyte so that, in operation, it can collect localized sensing information about the solid. The sensor element may be elongated in shape, having a length, e, from 1 mm to 1000 mm, and may be at least partially encapsulated within a corrosion-resistant casing if operated within an environment where reaction to an agent produces undesirable affects. A magnetically hard (MH) element supporting a biasing field adjacent the magnetically soft sensor element can be included. For example, the MH element may be made of a material chemically responsive to a fluid analyte such that exposure thereto causes a change in the biasing field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The higher frequency of the first field may be selected from a first range of frequencies (50 Hz to 10 MHz) and the frequency of the second field may be selected from a second range of frequencies (0.1 Hz to 10 Hz). The second field of lower frequency is of an amplitude selected to correspond to offset that of a MH element&apos;s stray field, in the event a MH element is incorporated with the apparatus. The first, higher frequency interrogation field may be generated continuously over time (e.g., steady state over a selected time interval) or generated in the form of a pulse, or signal-burst of, for example, approximately 20 cycles generated at the higher frequency, during which time the measurement of EM emission intensity is made. Preferably the second, lower frequency interrogation field is generated continuously over the time period during which the high frequency field is generated so that EM emission intensity measurements can be taken to identify harmonic frequency amplitude values. It is the first, higher frequency field produced in conjunction with the quasi-static second time-varying field that provides a mechanism by which relative maximum amplitudes for the harmonic(s) of interest can be identified, thus, allowing for a value for the parameter of interest (temperature, stress conditions, corrosion) to be determined. By sweeping the second, quasi-static interrogation field amplitude, a relative maximum of the harmonic EM emissions of interest from the sensor element can be identified&mdash;this amounts to a &lsquo;tracking&rsquo; of relative changes in EM emission intensity between several different higher-order harmonics to provide the parameter value (temperature, stress, corrosion) of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The first and second interrogation fields may be transmitted by a single interrogation field generating coil or separate coils; one may choose to use a single coil to not only generate the first and second interrogation fields but also aid in the detection of EM emissions from the sensor element by operating as part (pick-up coil) of the receiver. Preferably the emissions measured and relative maximum harmonic frequency amplitude values identified are for higher-order harmonics ranging from, preferably, the 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>to 100<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>harmonic of the fundamental resonant frequency for the sensor element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A pre-correlation made between a series of comparative relative maximum harmonic amplitude values and a corresponding series of temperature, stress conditions, or corrosion values can be used to aid in calculation of the particular parameter value of interest. This pre-correlation can be earlier obtained using a calibration sensor element of like size and material characteristics of the sensor element used on-site, whereby the relative maximum higher-order harmonic frequency amplitudes identified, represented by a plurality of voltages corresponding to EM harmonic emission measurements, are collected and plotted against parameter values (e.g., temperature, stress, or corrosion) of interest. To automate on-going monitoring of a parameter, a computerized device may be employed for instructing the receiver to take, over a time interval, a series of sensor element emission measurements, and communicate (or store for later use) each of a series of corresponding parameter values for these emission measurements taken. Further, a series of sensor element emission measurements may be taken over a selected response-time interval to produce a parameter response profile comprising a series of corresponding parameter values for the particular solid analyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The magnetically soft element is preferably made of a ferromagnetic alloy, including elements such as iron, cobalt, samarium, yttrium, gadolinium, terbium, or dysprosium. The element may take on a wide variety of shapes, including elongated ribbon shapes, rectangular-elongated, oval, elongated polygonal, etc., so long as the sensor element remains effectively magnetically soft thereby supporting a high magnetic permeability, allowing sufficient EM emission and remote receipt thereof according to the invention. For example, a width, w, that is less than three times a length, e, of the sensor element may be chosen.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically, in block diagram form, depicts components of an apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the invention for remote query utilizing amplitude values identified for the higher-order harmonic frequencies of interest emitted from a magnetically soft sensing element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Sensor structures similar to that depicted, enlarged for purposes of illustration at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (here, by way of example only, shaped as an elongated bar of width, w, and length, e), are located within or on a surface of the dashed-boundary <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> representing an environment or an analyte (i.e., substance undergoing analysis). Boundary <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> represents a multitude of different environments and analytes of varying sizes and conditions within which parameter of interest (temperature, stress conditions, or corrosion) will be measured. By way of example, the sensor may be located within an environment such as that encountered in a biomedical application or in monitoring of contaminants found in aqueous solution anlytes (such as groundwater, treated water, or wastewater whether flowing in natural or manmade waterways, canals, wells, or pipes), monitoring or measuring stress conditions or corrosion within construction materials (solid analytes), and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In many applications, only one such sensor structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is needed within an environment/analyte being sensed. As one can appreciate, a considerable range of sizes is available-preferably magnetically soft elements having a length, e, 1 mm to 1000 mm are contemplated. Where a &ldquo;package&rdquo; of sensing information is desired, several separate sensor structures can be located within the analyte (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>), or an ordered array of sensor structures may be fabricated in an array (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>) whether embedded within, interposed between laminate-layers, or atop a surface of a solid. Each sensor structure of such an array may be designed and built (sized/shaped and materials) to operate over a slightly different frequency range than the other sensors within the array; thus, making it easier to distinguish emissions received (or, &ldquo;heard&rdquo;) from each particular sensor of the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The preferred sensing apparatus of the invention depicted in block form at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a transmitting subassembly <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having at least two frequency generators or oscillators whose output is fed to a power amplifier which, in turn, feeds at least one time-varying field generating coil <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> capable of generating both time-varying interrogation fields <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A. One frequency generator (I) is used for generating the higher frequency time-varying interrogation field <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A and one (II) is used for generating the lower, quasi-static, time-varying field <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A. Preferably, the higher frequency generator (I) is capable of generating signals at frequencies ranging from 50 Hz to 10 MHz and the lower frequency (quasi-static, or effectively dc field) generator (II) is capable of generating signals at frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz. A receiving unit is depicted at <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to include the receiving device <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and EM emission detection circuitry <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The field generating device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> establishes alternating magnetic fields of desired frequency and amplitude in the area bounded by dashed line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The amplitude of the fields necessary to generate a predetermined signal level (sensor amplitude response) will vary depending upon system parameters such as coil size, sensor material, and sensitivity of receiving electronics.

Suitable emission detection circuitry (represented by box <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) is in communication with a suitable EM field/emission receiving coil. EM pick-up coils suitable for use to operate up to 1 MHz are readily available. Information gathered about the environment/analyte by the receiving unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is sent to a processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> (such as a dedicated microprocessor <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> controlled by software components or subroutines to perform data processing and manipulation) which is, in turn, connected to a user interface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of suitable type such as a monitor screen such as <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (whether or not touch-sensitive) displaying alphanumeric or waveform information, one or more light emitting diode (LED) indicators (such as a display of color-coded LEDs), automatic audio message or siren, and so on. Depending upon the nature and location of the environment/analyte <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> being sensed, the user interface may necessarily be located nearby, or several hundreds of miles from the environment and processing unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to communicate via digital phone line, coaxial cable, or satellite link. </paragraph>

The sensor element exposed to a 200 Hz interrogation field and a quasi-static interrogation-biasing field; the latter being swept slowly (either sinusoidally or linearly up and down) while maximum amplitudes of the different higher-order harmonics are identified (preferably, sweeping to find a relative maximum amplitude for each order harmonic of interest) and compared. This can be performed by tracking relative changes in EM emission intensity between different, neighboring, higher-order harmonics. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As temperature increases, the saturation magnetization M<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>of ferromagnetic materials decreases. However, the anisotropy field H<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>does not necessarily decreases with increasing temperature over the region investigated. Experimentally, H<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>of 2605SC was found to decrease with increasing temperature within the range of 21&deg; C. to 75&deg; C. As a result, the permeability of 2605SC increases with temperature. In contrast, H<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>of 2826MB was found to increase with temperature, resulting in a smaller permeability at high temperature with a decreasing harmonic amplitude. The permeability of 2714a remains stable with temperature between 21&deg; C. and 75&deg; C., hence it shows an almost zero response to temperature. The results shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> include amplitude of the 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>order harmonic as a function of temperature. A more-exacting temperature value can be calculated using the expression described in ATTACHMENT A (Eq. 1 above), where a ratio of two or more higher-order harmonics is used to mitigate the effect of sensor location and orientation. </paragraph>

Here, comparative relative maximum harmonic amplitude <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> values are plotted as a function of weight applied. The curve <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (representing the stress response for METGLAS&reg; 2605SC) and curve <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (representing stress response for METGLAS&reg; 2826MB), show measurable linear positive stress response, while the cobalt-rich alloy METGLAS&reg; 2714a has a negative smaller stress response (curve <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

Here, comparative relative maximum harmonic amplitude values are plotted as a function of stress cycle steps. For purposes of experimental demonstration, a &lsquo;stress cycle&rsquo; comprised increasing the mass load applied (hung from) then removed from the sensor element. One can see that once a 173 g mass was applied to the sensor element, an irreversible stress (plastic deformation of the magnetically soft material) occurred thus affecting stress cycles monitored thereafter. The sensor used to detect stress conditions inside, for example, concrete structures that support buildings, highways, and bridges. Based on the irreversible response seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the harmonic sensor can be used to indicate if a concrete structure has been exposed to too large stress that has resulted in internal structural damage. Buildings that have been exposed to considerable stress, such as that associated with an earthquake or explosion, may be stressed close to their failure point while inspection of the concrete does not indicate is potential for failure. Placement of these stress sensors within the concrete enable remote query of stress conditions inside the concrete. </paragraph>

For purposes of experimental demonstration, data was collected for a sensor element immersed in a 6% hyperchlorite solution (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) and in water (<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>). As the chlorine in the solution corrodes the sensor element, its magnetization and permeability are reduced resulting in a change (decrease) in the 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>order harmonic amplitude of the sensor element in solution, exposed to a 200 Hz interrogation field and a quasi-static interrogation-biasing field. High or prolonged exposure to chlorine is damaging to concrete and other solid analytes. Hence the sensor can be used to monitor the corrosion level inside concrete structures, such as for example the supporting columns of bridges. </paragraph>

Here, for purposes of experimental demonstration, data was collected for a concrete beam <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> within which several sensor elements <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>D are embedded.

By way of example, only to generate results reported in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> concrete beam of 30 cm&times;5 cm&times;5 cm was fabricated from Quikrete&reg; mortal mix. Sensors of 5.5 cm&times;3.65 mm&times;30 mm were embedded along the longitudinal axis of the concrete beam, and the beam was supported by its two ends as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

As depicted here at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a decrease in harmonic signal amplitude occurs with increasing stress. Compare <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the correlation at <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> (harmonic signal amplitude increases with increasing load applied) where the stress is directly applied to the test sensor element (vertically oriented as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) by hanging the load from a lower-end of the vertically oriented hanging element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A four-stage experiment was conducted and maximum amplitude of the 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>harmonic was tracked as a function of increasing stress on the sensor (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>): &lcub;1&rcub; During the first stage, the weight of the load was increased in 1 kg increments until the total weight reached 10 kg; the response of the sensor was monitored after each increment. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the increasing weight linearly stresses the embedded sensors within the bar. &lcub;2&rcub; The 10 kg load was then removed from the beam and the response of the sensor was measured five different times. The response of the sensors stays fixed at the maximum stress level, indicating an irreversible stress within the concrete. &lcub;3&rcub; The load weight was then increased from 10 kg to 13 kg, with the sensor response measured after each 1 kg increment. &lcub;4&rcub; After reaching 13 kg the weight was removed and the sensors measured; the flat response of the sensor indicates the stress level within the concrete is irreversible. Employing the harmonic sensor technique of the invention, one can see a change in the signal amplitude when the concrete beam was exposed to a stress, even where there is no observable damage or indication of deformation from visually inspecting the outside surface. Hence, the harmonic sensor provides an effective way to detect internal damages of concrete structures such as buildings, bridges, roadways, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> schematically represents a sensor element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> interposed between two MH elements <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>B as array <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The elements are biased as follows: element <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>A biased at &minus;5 Oe, magnetically soft element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is unbiased, and element <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>B at &plus;5 Oe. Ferrites generally have stray magnetic fields of several tens of Oersteds (Oe); their stochiometric composition can be varied to enable the stray field they support to change with chemical exposure. Hence when a &lsquo;designer&rsquo; MH biasing elements are used in combination with a magnetically-soft sensing element, the biasing field turn-on point determined by the MH biasing element can be used as an indicator of background chemistry concentration. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> graphically depicts the harmonic response for the array of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>; amplitude of the 2<highlight><superscript>nd</superscript></highlight>-order harmonic measured by detecting electromagnetic emissions from the sensor array <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, is plotted against biasing field.

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Magnetic material/substances exhibit magnetic and elastic phenomena. Magnetic interaction depend of the distance of the interacting particles and consequently magnetic and mechanic effected interact. In ferromagnetic materials, magnetostriction is observed: The dimensions and elastic properties of magnetic materials often depend on the state of magnetization (direct magnetoelastic effect). Materials that possess both effects, especially magnetically soft ferromagnetic materials (i.e. materials having a low coercive forces), are commonly referred to as magnetoelastic materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Generation of the higher order harmonics is purely an electromagnetic response based upon the permeability of the magnetically soft material, and not dependent upon the sensor mechanically vibrating; consequently the sensor can be encased within plastics, cement, glue, etc. without affecting the generation of higher-order harmonics. For the most part, overall sensor element length does not affect the harmonic response except as to total harmonic signal amplitude (a physically larger sensor element to provide greater signal than a physically smaller sensor element), or if the size of the sensor is reduced to a point that the demagnetizing field (associated with all magnetic materials) reduces the permeability of the material. Magnetically soft alloys are those that become magnetized readily upon application of a field and that return to effectively a nonmagnetic condition when the applied field is removed. The magnetically soft alloys currently widely available for use and testing are ferromagnetic, or ferrous, alloys characterized by their properties of high magnetic permeability, low coercive force and low magnetic hysteresis loss. Magnetically hard (MH) alloys, generally ferromagnetic, are those capable of being magnetized permanently because of an ability to retain induced magnetization and magnetic poles after removal of externally applied fields-MH alloys have high coercive force. The space around a MH material has a &lsquo;stray&rsquo; bias/biasing field. The word &ldquo;hard&rdquo; was adopted based on the fact that the quality of early permanent magnets was related to their hardness. Suitable magnetically hard materials include ferromagnetic metal alloys and their oxides, capable of supporting sufficient external stray fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The material for the MH biasing element may be chosen for its selective response to a background chemical species or a corrosive undergoing analysis. This selective response will cause a change in the material characteristics of the MH element in turn changing the DC bias field supported by the MH biasing element, which due to its proximity to the magnetically soft sensing element, changes the EM emissions radiated therefrom. Alternatively, the material for the MH biasing element may be chosen for its stray field to offset background radiation noise in the event the sensing element is located in a particularly &lsquo;noisy&rsquo; environment or solid analye. Whether a MH element is employed for its supporting bias field, according to the invention, it is the harmonic frequency response of the EM emissions remotely measured or detected for which an amplitude is identified to provide the sensing or monitoring information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> There are many magnetically soft materials currently available that may be used to construct a sensing element of the invention. Suitable amorphous metallic (glassy) alloys are commercially available under the brand names of METGLAS&reg; (a registered trademark of Honeywell International, Inc.) and SENSORVAC&reg; (a registered trademark of Vaccumschmelze (VAC) Corporation) alloys. One amorphous cobalt-based alloy known commercially as METGLAS&reg; 2826MB (distributed by Allied Signal, Inc. in New Jersey) is vacuum annealed in the presence of a DC magnetic field to enhance magnetostriction. Another available magnetostrictive amorphous cobalt-based magnetically soft alloy is known commercially as ATALANTE&reg; film, distributed by Innovative Sputtering Technology N.V. of Karreweg, Belgium (this film is used throughout Europe in anti-theft retail item markers). In the case of the sensor element used for collecting information about stress conditions and corrosion, it is preferable to choose a magnetically soft material, such as a cobalt-based one, that remains relatively stable (i.e., the material is generally insensitive to temperature fluxes) over the expected range of operating temperatures. It is preferable to choose an iron-rich magnetically soft material for the sensor element used as a temperature sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> By way of further background: The central processing unit (CPU) is the computing part of the computer. Also often referred to simply as the processor, a CPU it is made up of the control unit and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU)&mdash;a high-speed circuit that does calculating and comparing. Numbers are transferred from memory into the ALU for calculation, and the results are sent back into memory. Alphanumeric data is sent from memory into the ALU for comparing. The CPUs of almost all computers are contained on a single chip. As is well known, the basic elements of a simple computer include a CPU, clock and main memory; whereas a complete computer system requires the addition of control units, input, output and storage devices, as well as an operating system. Computer professionals involved with mainframes and microcomputers sometimes refer to the whole computer as the CPU, in which case, CPU refers to the processor, memory (RAM) and I/O architecture (channels or buses). Once the data is in a computer&apos;s memory, the computer can process it by calculating, comparing and copying it; generally understood as follows: calculating&mdash;performing any mathematical operation on data by adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing one set with another; comparing&mdash;analysis and evaluation of data by matching it with sets of known data that are included in a program or called in from storage; and coping&mdash;the moving of data around to create any kind of report or listing, etc., in a selected order. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to switchable optical devices, and, more particularly, to switchable optical components such as switchable mirrors and variable retarders and their fabrication. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The art of producing useful optical components based on porous thin films fabricated via the method of vacuum deposition of inorganic materials at oblique angles has steadily evolved over the latter half of the 20<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>century. In a seminal article appearing in Nature 183, 104 (1959), Young and Kowal describe the remarkable observation of optical activity in obliquely deposited films made using a material which is found otherwise to be optically isotropic. They achieved this result by depositing the material at an oblique incidence angle on a rotating substrate. Hodgkinson and Wilson review subsequent work that elucidates the relationship between the structure and properties of obliquely deposited thin films in an article entitled &ldquo;Microstructural-induced anisotropy in thin films for optical applications,&rdquo; appearing in CRC Critical Reviews in Solid State and Materials Sciences 15 (1), 27 (1988). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There are several noteworthy technologies based on obliquely deposited thin films. First is the optical retardation plate, as described by Motohiro and Taga in Applied Optics 28 (13), 2466 (1989). Motohiro and Taga demonstrated a quarter-wave retarder at a wavelength of 546 nm using an obliquely deposited Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>thin film structure. In that work, the anisotropy of the Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>film is attributed to form birefringence of inclined Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>nano-columns formed on the substrate during the deposition process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A second technology is a high spatial frequency chiral thin film structure, proposed in a theoretical work by Azzam in Applied Physics Letters 61 (26), 3118 (1992). This structure bears similarity to the films fabricated by Young and Kowal; however, Azzam suggested higher spatial frequency structures that would act as polarization sensitive Bragg reflectors. Such films reflect light within a band of wavelengths that has the same polarization handedness as the chiral film, and pass light of the orthogonal polarization. Examples of these structures were reported by Fan et al. in Optics Communications 147, 265 (1998), as well as by Hodgkinson and Wu in Applied Physics Letters 74(13), 1794 (1999). It is useful to note that these structures are artificial analogs of naturally occurring cholesteric liquid crystal materials. The optical properties of cholesterics are discussed by DeGennes and Prost in <highlight><italic>The Physics of Liquid Crystals </italic></highlight>(2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>ed., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993), chapter 6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Similarly, Robbie and Brett in U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,204 describe methodologies for growing helical columns using the technique of oblique vapor deposition on a rotating substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A third proposed application for porous films formed by oblique vapor deposition is as a micro-sieve. Robbie and Brett in the aforementioned patent point out that the volume density of obliquely deposited films can be made to vary between 10-90%. Further, the characteristic channel size in the films is in the nanometer regime. Both of these characteristics make them suitable for use as micro-sieves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A fourth application of obliquely deposited films is as an alignment layer for liquid crystal displays. John L. Janning was the first to report on the &ldquo;sympathetic alignment&rdquo; of nematic liquid crystals on an obliquely deposited film in Applied Physics Letters 21(4), 173 (1972). In that work, an 8-&mgr;m-thick twisted nematic display was aligned using 7-nm-thick obliquely evaporated SiO films on the top and bottom display substrates. Lawrence A. Goodman et al. in IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices ED-24, 795 (1977) and Julian Cheng et al. in Applied Physics Letters 37(8), 716 (1980) provide physical descriptions of nematic alignment using porous columnar structures obtained via oblique depositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Akhlesh Lakhtakia et al. in Innovations in Materials Research 1(2), 165 (1996) and in Microwave and Optical Technology Letters 17(2), 135 (1998) mention the possibility of imbibing porous obliquely evaporated films with &ldquo;suitable fluids&rdquo; to obtain devices aimed at &ldquo;some desired goal.&rdquo; However, this prior art lacks sufficient information to effectively fabricate switchable optical components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of this invention to utilize liquid crystal-imbibed obliquely evaporated films as switchable optical components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to utilize liquid crystal-imbibed obliquely evaporated films to fabricate variable retarders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of this invention to utilize liquid crystal-imbibed obliquely evaporated films to fabricate mirrors with electrically switchable reflectance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The objects set forth above as well as further and other objects and advantages of the present invention are achieved by the embodiments of the invention described herinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to switchable optical components that are produced using a unique class of materials. These materials are thin film composites comprising of porous inorganic films imbibed with liquid crystal materials. The porous inorganic thin films are fabricated using the technique of vacuum deposition at an oblique angle of incidence. The liquid crystal materials possess an inherent large optical anisotropy that can be altered using an applied electric field or thermally, by heating or cooling the materials. When combined according to the present invention, the resulting composite materials exhibit large tunable optical indices. This enables the construction of variable retarders and mirrors with switchable reflectance. The composite materials described in the present invention will be referred to as dielectric confined liquid crystals, or DCLCs, in analogy with polymer dispersed liquid crystal materials, or PDLCs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects thereof, reference is made to the accompanying drawings and detailed description.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to switchable optical components based on dielectric confined liquid crystal (DCLC) materials and their methods of fabrication. The DCLC materials utilized here are a new class of composite materials that utilize confined, rather than bulk-layer liquid crystals. These composite materials are comprised of a porous nano-engineered dielectric host material that is imbibed with a liquid crystal material. The orientation of the confined liquid crystal molecules is influenced by the dielectric host, but may be altered by an applied electric field, or thermally, by heating or cooling the structure. Liquid crystal materials possessing a large, electrically or thermally tunable optical anisotropy render the optical indices of the composite structures tunable. The resulting DCLC materials may be configured as variable retarders or as mirrors with variable reflectance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic pictorial diagram showing a single plane of nano-columns formed by an oblique vacuum deposition. Such a layer will also be referred to as a nano-column film, or NCF. A vapor stream of evaporant material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is incident on a substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at an angle &dgr; with respect to the substrate normal. The coordinate system in the figure is set-up so that the z-axis lies parallel to the substrate normal, and the yz-plane contains the direction vector of the evaporant vapor stream <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Self-shadowing and limited atomic mobility leads to the growth of nano-column structures on the substrate surface; a representative nano-column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is highlighted in the figure. It is well known in the art that these nano-columns lie in the plane of incidence of the vapor stream <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and that the angle &psgr; between the substrate normal and the long axis of the nano-columns is less than the evaporation angle &dgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows a cross-sectional view of a single NCF that has been imbibed with a nematic liquid crystal. This composite structure is comprised of nano-columns <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> formed via the methods described above, and nematic liquid crystal, which fills the void regions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> between the nano-columns <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this figure, the short line segments in the nematic regions <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> indicate the nematic directors, which are parallel with the long axis of the nematic liquid crystal molecule. The nematic is assumed to possess a positive dielectric anisotropy so that the directors tend to align along an axis parallel to the direction of an applied electric field. The composite film is confined between two substrates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that each have a transparent conducting film <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, such as indium tin oxide, or ITO, on the inside surfaces to facilitate the application of an electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) indicates that in the absence of an applied field, the nematic directors are parallel with the nano-columns throughout the film. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows that under the influence of a sufficiently strong electric field E that is parallel with the z-axis, the nematic directors reorient and thereby change the optical indices of refraction of the nematic-imbibed NCF. Such a structure can be utilized as a variable retarder. Alternatively, the nematic order shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) may be significantly altered by heating the structure past the clearing temperature of the imbibed nematic <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. When heated past the clearing temperature, the nematic directors become randomly oriented. This also is a method for altering the optical indices of the imbibed NCF. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> One variable retarder of the preferred embodiments of this invention relates to a variable retarder. More specifically, the device considered in this invention and as set forth in this example is an optically anisotropic film with electrically tunable birefringence that is comprised of a single DCLC layer. The DCLC shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>operates as a variable phase shifter or retarder for light incident along the z-axis. If the polarization plane of the incident light contains the x- or y- axes, the DCLC serves as a variable phase shifter; otherwise, the DCLC serves as a variable retarder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A model is constructed to indicate the magnitude of the change in indices of refraction of a nematic-imbibed NCF under the influence of an electric field. Consider first a single NCF that is imbibed with an isotropic material. For example, the isotropic material may be air or a nematic liquid crystal above the clearing temperature. In this case, the optical dielectric tensor for the film is written </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Finally, the y-component of the DCLC dielectric tensor in the field-on state, &egr;<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>ON</superscript></highlight>, is found. The nematic director configuration in the field-on state is shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>); however, the present model simplifies this depiction by having all nematic directors pointing along the z-axis. This is an idealization because the nematic molecules nearest the nano-column surfaces are expected to remain parallel to those surfaces due to surface anchoring forces. Utilizing this simplifying assumption, &egr;<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>ON </superscript></highlight>is found by substituting &egr;<highlight><subscript>v</subscript></highlight>&rarr;&egr;<highlight><subscript>vy</subscript></highlight>&equals;n<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>into Eq.

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Another preferred embodiment of this invention relates to switchable optical mirrors. More specifically, mirrors made from multi-layer DCLC stacks that have electrically tunable reflectance are also described in the present invention. These devices were modeled using a 4&times;4 numerical code that was developed by Dwight Berreman in The Journal of the Optical Society of America 62(4), 502 (1972). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows a stack of DCLC layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> between two substrates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that are each coated with a layer of ITO <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The DCLC stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a total thickness L&equals;N&middot;h, where N is the number of DCLC layers and h is the thickness of an individual DCLC layer. The present discussion considers DCLC layers with uniform thickness h; however, it is known that useful reflective structures can be made using stacks comprised of layers that do not have a uniform thickness. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the incident optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, reflected beam <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and transmitted beam <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> all lie in the xz-plane and propagate at an angle &thgr; with respect to the DCLC-stack normal, which in this case is parallel to the z-axis. Note that &thgr; is measured within the substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Also, for the purpose of simplifying the DCLC mirror model, the substrate index n<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>is chosen to be equal to the average index of the DCLC stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows an exploded view of DCLC stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The DCLC stack <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has thickness L and is comprised of N-DCLC layers, each with thickness h. As described in the previous example, each layer is optically anisotropic. While each of the layers has identical optical indices, in the mirror configuration, the layers have a z-dependent optic axis orientation, as denoted in the figure by an arrow that labels the c&prime;-axis for each layer. Here, the c&prime;-axis is the projection of the layer c-axis, or optic axis, in the xy-plane. The orientation of the c&prime;-axis is denoted by &phgr;, as drawn in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) for the topmost plane only of the DCLC stack. The angle &phgr; is referred to as the azimuthal angle, and it is a measure of the angle between the c&prime;-axis and the x-axis; each layer of the DCLC stack may have a unique azimuthal angle value. Note also, that M-DCLC layers have been explicitly labeled at positions z<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, z<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, . . . z<highlight><subscript>M-1</subscript></highlight>. This group of layers with total thickness &Lgr;&equals;M&middot;h is a repeating sub-structure within the multi-layer stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Two DCLC mirror structures are described in this invention based on the structures shown schematically in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). One structure is a quarter-wave stack and the second is a chiral stack. The material system chosen to illustrate these mirrors is a CaF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/BL006 composite with nano-column volume fraction &phgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.30 and inclination angle &psgr;&equals;62&deg;. This DCLC material system was chosen because of the large range in layer birefringence that it exhibits, viz. &Dgr;n<highlight><superscript>OFF</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.1512 to &Dgr;n<highlight><superscript>ON</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.0018 &lsqb;see Eq. (10)&rsqb;. Note that the field-off birefringence is large, which is desirable for achieving high bandwidth, high reflectance mirrors with relatively few DCLC layers. Note also that the field-on birefringence is quite small, which is a requirement for achieving high contrast mirrors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The first DCLC mirror configuration that is described is the DCLC quarter-wave stack. In this configuration, the repeating sub-structure consists of two layers with orthogonal c&prime;-axes. That is, the difference in azimuthal angle values of any two adjacent layers is 90 degrees. Two devices were modeled based on the quarter-wave DCLC stack. Both are designed to operate at a wavelength around &lgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;1550 nm; however, one is designed to operate at normal incidence (&thgr;&equals;0) and the other is designed to operate at &thgr;&equals;45&deg;. Since the DCLC layer thickness is given by h&equals;&lgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>/(4{overscore (n)}<highlight><subscript>2D</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>OFF</superscript></highlight>&middot;cos&thgr;), where {overscore (n)}<highlight><subscript>2D</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>OFF </superscript></highlight>is given by Eq. (10), the layer thickness values are h&equals;247, 350 nm for &thgr;&equals;0, 45&deg;, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> show the transmission of the two switchable quarter-wave mirrors based on DCLCs. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is the transmission of the normal incidence device. This structure is comprised of 40 periods and has a total thickness of L&equals;19.8 &mgr;m. In the figure, T<highlight><superscript>OFF,ON </superscript></highlight>refer to the mirror transmission in the field-off and field-on conditions, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the transmission of the device designed for operation at &thgr;&equals;45&deg;. This device is comprised of 30 periods for a total thickness of L&equals;20.8 &mgr;m. The contrast between T<highlight><superscript>ON </superscript></highlight>and T<highlight><superscript>OFF </superscript></highlight>is 27.4 dB for the 40-period DCLC mirror, and is 28.4 dB for the 30-period mirror; both values are quite good. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Another important metric for quantifying the performance of these mirrors is the polarization dependent loss, or PDL. Defining PDL as

The PDL for the 40-period mirror is identically zero, while the PDL&equals;0.003 dB for the 30-period (&thgr;&equals;45&deg;) DCLC mirror.

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The second DCLC mirror configuration of this invention is the DCLC chiral stack.

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The chiral DCLC mirrors that will be discussed here are made of a discrete number of DCLC layers, such as the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). However, chiral DCLC mirrors may also be fabricated via oblique evaporation onto a continuously rotating substrate. The resulting structure produced via the latter procedure is also a porous, chiral reflective structure that can be imbibed with a nematic liquid crystal to yield a chiral mirror with variable reflectance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the DCLC chiral stack of this invention is characterized by a repeating sub-structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> wherein the c&prime;-axis of successive layers spirals about the z-axis. When the c&prime;-axis spirals about the z-axis in a left-handed (LH) sense, the structure possesses LH chirality; when the c&prime;-axis spirals about the z-axis in a right-handed (RH) sense, the structure possesses RH chirality. A LH chiral DCLC stack will reflect left-hand circularly polarized (LCP) light within the selective reflection band of the structure, while a RH chiral DCLC stack will reflect right-hand circularly polarized (RCP) light within the selective reflection band of the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Examples of transmission characteristics for two electrically tunable chiral DCLC mirrors are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. These figures show the polarization-resolved transmission values, T<highlight><subscript>RCP</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>OFF,ON </superscript></highlight>and T<highlight><subscript>LCP</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>OFF,ON</superscript></highlight>, as a function of wavelength, for the two mirrors in the field-off and field-on states. Note that the subscripts RCP and LCP refer to right- and left-hand circularly polarized incident light. Both mirrors are left-hand chiral and contain 8 individual DCLC layers per pitch, <highlight><superscript>p</superscript></highlight>, with a reflection band centered at &lgr;<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;543 nm. The mirror modeled in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is designed for normal incidence light and is comprised of a 15-pitch DCLC with a total thickness of 5.26_m. The mirror modeled in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is designed for light incident at &thgr;&equals;45&deg; and is comprised of a 50-pitch DCLC with a total thickness 24.8_m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A few features from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> are noteworthy. First, the normal incidence chiral mirror reflects only LCP light in the field-off state, because the mirror spatial structure is left-hand chiral, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The maximum polarization extinction ratio for this mirror is 27.2 dB, which happens to be equal to the field-off:field-on, or switching, contrast ratio. The field-off state transmission spectra shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> for the chiral mirror designed for use at oblique incidence angle show a total reflection band near the design wavelength of 543 nm. This total reflection band is also present in static, planar texture cholesteric liquid crystals, as documented by Takezoe et al. in The Japanese Journal of Applied Physics 22(7), 1080 (1983). This mirror exhibits a switching contrast of 29.6 dB for LCP light, and a contrast of 23.9 dB for RCP light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described with respect to various embodiments, it should be realized this invention is also capable of a wide variety of further and other embodiments within the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Evanescently coupled closed-loop ring resonators in general, and Racetrack Ring Resonators (R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>s) or elongated loops in particular, offer several interesting features for applications such as Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) and RF photonics. Lacking reflectors, fabrication of the same is generally free of lapping, cleaving, facet etching and coating, or of concerns arising from high mirror power density. Spectral characteristics of the same can be conventionally determined using well known photolithography techniques, and single wavelength operation can be achieved without gratings. When combined with other components small diameter low loss passive and active ring resonators, on the order of &lt;200 &mgr;m, enable the fabrication of sophisticated photonic integrated circuits that take full advantage of two-dimensional (2-D) chip layouts. With the development of robust fabrication methods, such photonic circuits may include composite linking and switching systems, local oscillator distribution, and true-delay signal distribution at wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 &mgr;m to name a few. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Previous efforts have been carried out to demonstrate R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>Lasers (R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>Ls) in both AlGaAs and InGaAsP material systems and using different coupling schemes. Undesirably, conventional, shallow-etched Ridge-WaveGuide (RWG) circular structures are limited to large diameters, on the order of <custom-character file="US20020154674A1-20021024-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00001"/>&gE;300 &mgr;m, due to excessive bending loss. The low index difference between the guiding channel core and its surrounding of RWG structures causes a significant evanescent portion of a guided mode, which cannot propagate at group velocities exceeding </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> where c is the speed of light in vacuum and n<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>the effective refractive index of the mode to radiate. Even for large-diameter shallow-etched structures, significant bending loss is evidenced by large threshold currents ranging from 106 to 150 mA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Coupling into deeply etched laser structures has been achieved by using either Y-junction or MultiMode Interference (MMI) couplers. In spite of the reduced bending loss, deeply etched R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>Ls have also demonstrated large threshold current values, in excess of 170 mA. Vertical walls etched through an epitaxial waveguide have also been used in small diameter passive ring structures, on the order of &lE;10 &mgr;m, to allow negligible waveguide bending and scattering loss. However, strong confinement caused by deep etching undesirably requires sub-micrometer lateral separation between the ring and coupled waveguides to achieve adequate coupling and requires fabrication tolerances of &minus;10/&plus;20 nm. Furthermore, when used as a highly transmissive filter, coupling coefficients in and out of the ring resonator must be nearly identical, undesirably tightening fabrication constraints even further. Reliance on sub-micrometer features and tolerances entails significant impediments to achieving a robust manufacture-able technology that lends itself to large-scale integration and mass productive of ring resonator based photonic circuits. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A design for closed-loop ring resonator coupling that uses conventional photolithography and exhibits improved control over coupling strength is presented. The present invention will be described as it relates to an InGaAsP ring resonator waveguide in the form of a Racetrack Ring Resonator (R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>) placed between two straight input/output waveguides as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It should be clearly understood that the present invention is equally applicable to other closed-loop shapes, as well as other types of devices, such as passive devices including filters for example. Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, therein is illustrated a portion of an R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>configuration <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to one aspect of the present invention. The configuration <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a closed loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and waveguides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Waveguides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are evanescently coupled to the closed loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using coupling portions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the closed-loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, respectively. Such a configuration is suitable for photonics switching and signal processing as well. Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the closed-loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated therein takes the form of an elongated ring, or racetrack. Curved portions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the closed-loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> interconnect coupling regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the present invention, deep etching is utilized to advantageously reduce bending loss at the curved sections <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but is avoided at the gap between the straight sections of the loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the input/output waveguides, i.e. the coupling regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, where it may interfere with coupling into and out of the waveguides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. There, a shallower etch which defines the coupling regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is halted before removing the epitaxial waveguiding layers according to another aspect of the present invention. This multi-level etching technique is essentially a modification of the MMI method that provides better control of the coupling in deeply etched structures where, due to the large index contrast, a large number of modes participate in the interaction. It is important to note that although a straight section of the deeply etched waveguide can support higher-order lateral modes, the curved sections of the loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, i.e. the curved portions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, whose first-order lateral mode cutoff radius is 250 &mgr;m, discriminate in favor of single lateral mode operation. Moreover, the depth of etching in the coupling region determines whether that region is a directional coupler, having only two lateral modes participating in the coupling, or a modified MMI coupler where more than two lateral modes determine the power splitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The issues of coupling strength and coupling efficiency are of utmost importance to the performance of R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>Ls, like many other optical devices. They not only affect power extraction efficiency, but introduce intracavity loss that, in laser structures, increases the threshold current. The electromagnetic field transmitted from the input <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the output <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> coupling waveguide of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> through the resonator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is given by

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The couplers play a role analogous to FP mirrors. To obtain unity transmission at resonance with zero gain the coupling coefficients should be equal, i.e., t<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;t<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, which for the case of deeply etched structure predicates extremely tight fabrication constraints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a schematic cross-section diagram of the configuration <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> taken at the coupling region between the ring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a waveguide section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> according to one aspect of the present invention. The structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> generally includes a substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, formed of InP for example. Upon the substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is formed a waveguide and quantum wells <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> including layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which comprise the core of the waveguide. Both layers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> have a higher refractive index than their surrounding surface of the device and the shoulder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is the cap layer fabricated from a highly conductive p&plus; material. Numeral <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> references an area of the layer where quantum wells are located. A typical quantum well can be conventionally 70 &angst;-100 &angst; thick. Areas <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are of the same material and function as the cladding layer of the optical waveguide and are both the p or n side of the formed diode junction. These areas have a lower refractive index than the core areas. Layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> could be placed anywhere between the top <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> surface of the device and the shoulder <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is the cap layer fabricated from a highly conductive p&plus; material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, multiple etched levels <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are shown, in the particular case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, </cross-reference>2 levels are shown. This is referred to herein as &ldquo;bi-level&rdquo; etching. Of course, additional levels can be formed. The etched level designated <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> defines the waveguides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and closed loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in general. The etched level designated <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> defines the coupling region between the waveguides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the closed loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The depth of the etched levels <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is different. This defines the bi-level etching. It should be understood that the deeper etched level <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is described herein for purposes of more deeply defining an outer wall <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the curved regions or portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the closed loop <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as that is where most losses due to bending occur (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Of course, other particular configurations which effectively increase the depth of the outer walls <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be used to accomplish the same results. That is, deep etching is required mainly along and in the vicinity of the outer wall of the curved section of the ring resonator, whereas shallower etching levels can be prescribed to other regions of the device including, but not limited to the coupling region between the straight sections of the R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and the input/output waveguides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that in the case illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the etched level <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> does not enter the waveguide <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, that is it stops short of reaching thereinto. This results in a multimode waveguide. If the etched level <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is extended into the waveguide <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> a 2-mode directional coupler can be advantageously achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the Organo-Metallic Chemical Vapor Deposition (OMCVD)-grown epistructure shown therein includes three compressively strained InGaAsP quantum wells imbedded in a 70-nm waveguide structure of two compositions with bandgap energy E<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>&equals;1.13 and 1.00 eV. Cladding layers are InP. The fabrication involves several steps not normally used in conjunction with conventional RWG laser processing. These include: 1) liftoff metal deposition of closely spaced lines and 2) both shallow and deep etching with no feature undercutting. For the coupling channel between parallel waveguides as is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an asymmetric structure is fabricated. The waveguiding geometry is first defined by H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/CH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>reactive ion etching (RIE), timed to remove the p-type cladding layer and reveal the upper surface of the waveguide structure. Next, the coupling region is coated with a second dielectric layer. Smooth side-walls extending through the waveguide structure are etched, except in the coupling region protected by the second dielectric layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A bend radius of 150 &mgr;m is combined with four different coupler lengths of 50, 100, 150, and 200 &mgr;m, positioned at the center of the straight section of the racetrack, which is 50 &mgr;m longer. The width of ridges throughout the structure is 2.5 &mgr;m and the gap between resonator and coupling waveguides is 2 &mgr;m. The coupling waveguides, which extend beyond the racetrack ring resonator, are cleaved, and output facets optically coated to &ap;3% reflectivity. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Fig. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a top-view showing the racetrack resonator and the straight coupling waveguides. Biasing electrodes are provided separately for the ring resonator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the portion of each of the two coupling waveguides <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extending from the resonator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the autoregressive-coated facet. The latter are biased approximately to transparency to facilitate laser characterization. The remaining portion of the coupling waveguides <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extending toward the rear facet are bent and flared to cut down the effective reflectivity from the unused facet. These sections can be also reverse-biased to further reduce parasitic reflectivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Continuous-wave (CW) room-temperature relative L-I characteristics of devices having all four L<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>values are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. These indicate threshold currents varying from 66 mA for the 50 and 150 &mgr;m coupling region devices to 72 mA for the 100 and 200 &mgr;m devices. These threshold currents are more than a factor of two lower than the lowest-threshold InP ring lasers previously reported. It is believed that this dramatically improved threshold performance is attributable to the multi-level, in the illustrated case bi-level, etched R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>L design. The corresponding threshold current densities range between 2.145 kA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for the 200-&mgr;m coupler to 2.53 kA/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for the50-&mgr;m coupler. These values are within a factor of two to three of threshold current densities of world-record RWG FP lasers with similar dimensions and fabricated from similar material. Changing the bias level of the straight coupling waveguides has a negligible effect on the threshold current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The small dependence of the threshold current on the coupling length indicates that the loss in the cavity is governed mostly by mechanisms other than the output coupling, such as scattering due to wall roughness, bending loss, or modal transition from the curved to the straight section and from the deeply etched to the shallow etched transition regions. Passive measurements of the devices were taken at longer wavelength using temperature tuned InGaAsP DFB laser operating at 1.655-1.659 &mgr;m. Depth of modulation of about 20% was observed with finesse of 2.5. Coupling efficiency of 20% and effective distributed loss, combining bending, mode matching and scattering loss, of 15.1 &lsqb;cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>&rsqb; were calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The CW spectrum of an R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>L with 100-&mgr;m-long couplers is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. It exhibits single longitudinal mode operation with a side-mode suppression ration better than 26 dB. Many ring laser modes are clearly visible as noise peaks below that level. Single mode lasing is obtained up to nearly twice threshold. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, at 140 mA, the spectrum abruptly changes to a broad spectrum of the same ring laser modes, suggestive of passively mode locked self pulsation. The separation of these modes was observed to match and scale inversely with the circumference of the racetrack <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In other words, the present discussion presents an InGaAsP closed-loop ring resonator device, such as an R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>L laser employing a novel multi-level etched structure, such as a bi-level etched structure, which can be defined by conventional photolithography and incorporates low-loss curved waveguides and lateral couplers. In the particular case of the illustrated R<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>L, it exhibits a threshold current of 66 mA, which is the lowest value of any InP ring resonator laser reported to date. It operates in a single mode to nearly twice the threshold with a 26-dB side-mode suppression ratio. This novel fabrication technique can be also be applied to the construction of passive ring resonators devices such as filters, modulators, routers, and detectors, for example. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Detection of image salience in a visual display of an image. The image is analyzed at multiple spatial scales and over multiple feature channels to determine the likely salience of different portions of the image. One application for the system is in an advertising context. The detection may be improved by second order statistics, e.g. mean and the standard deviations of different image portions relative to other portions. Different edges may be considered as being extended edges by looking at the edges over multiple spatial scales. One set of feature channels can be optimized for use in moving images, and can detect motion or flicker. The images can be obtained over multiple spectral ranges the user can be instructed about how to maximize the saliency. This can be applied to automatically evaluate and optimize sales or advertisement displays. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Different systems for analysis of vision components are known. Many of these systems, broadly categorized under machine vision, attempt to use the machine, usually a digital computer running dedicated software, to actually identify parts of the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, vision algorithms frequently fail when confronted with real life images. These real life images may be of extremely high resolution, e.g., on the order of 6000 by 4000 pixels, and may be very cluttered with information that might not necessarily be relevant to the visual task at hand. For instance, many images may have partially occluding objects such as foliage, vehicles, people and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is believed that biological vision systems use a different approach. The mammalian visual system is believed to use a computational strategy of identifying interesting parts of the image without extensively analyzing the content of the image. The entire image may be analyzed in parallel for simple features. Portions of the image are then selected, based either on their behavioral relevance or based on local image cues. The local image cues may include brightness, motion, and/or color and others. The mammalian brain evolved in this manner to handle the enormous amount of information that is received from a scene. This information has been estimated as being on the order of up to 10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>bits per second along the optic nerve, the axonal fibers that constitute the output of the retina. This may exceed what the brain is capable of fully processing and assimilating into its conscious experience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Because of this processing strategy, only a small fraction of the information that is actually registered by the human visual system actually influences behavior. Different studies have demonstrated this in different ways. In some studies (&ldquo;change blindness&rdquo;) (Rensink, R. A., O&apos;Regan, J. K., and Clark, J. J. &ldquo;To see or not to see: The need for attention to perceive changes in scenes,&rdquo; Psychological Sci. 8:368-373, 1997) significant image changes are not actually perceived under natural viewing conditions. However, once the attention of the person is directed to these changes, they can be easily perceived. This implies that even though a part of an image might be registered by the brain, the conscious mind might not be visually aware of that part or any other in the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Those parts of an image which elicit a strong, rapid and automatic response from viewers, independent of the task they are trying to solve, can be referred to as being &ldquo;visually salient&rdquo;. Two examples of such salient locations are a green object among red ones, or a vertical line among horizontal ones. The mind can direct its attention to other parts of the image, although that may require voluntary effort. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention describes a computer-based implementation that allows automatic detection of salient parts of image information. This may use a model which is based on the way the primate&apos;s visual system is believed to process the retinal image stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The application discloses the basic model, and applications of the model to various practical uses. One such use includes detection of the effectiveness of an image or temporal sequence of images in displaying their content, e.g., in advertising context. Some specific model attributes are also disclosed. A first model attribute describes higher order statistical analysis of image information to compute saliency. Another model attribute discloses detection of extended but interrupted contours within the image information that can contribute to image saliency. In another model attribute, the computation of saliency specific to moving objects in a video sequence or constantly changing image sequences is described. Another aspect relates to the improvement of computing saliency for video sequence detection, by detecting portions of the video sequence which flicker. Another relates to the usage of multiple spectral images acquired of the same scene. Another relates to the ability of the model to provide specific feedback on how to improve the saliency of specific objects or locations in the scene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> At the basis of the invention was the original concept of a &ldquo;saliency map&rdquo; proposed by Koch and Ullman (Koch, C. and Ullman, S. Shifts in selective visual attention: towards the underlying neural circuitry. <highlight><italic>Human Neurobiology, </italic></highlight>4:219-227, 1985), and two detailed computer implementations: Itti, L., Koch, C. and Niebur, E.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a system for determining a saliency map, which may be a two-dimensional map that encodes salient objects in a visual environment. The map of the scene expresses the saliency of all locations in this image. This map is the result of competitive interactions among feature maps for image features including color, orientation, texture, motion, depth and so on, that interact within and across each map. At any time, the currently strongest location in the saliency map corresponds to the most salient object. The value in the map represents the local saliency of any one location with respect to its neighborhood. By default, the system directs attention towards the most salient location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A second most salient location may be found by inhibiting the most salient location, causing the system to automatically shift to the next most salient location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The techniques described herein are based on the bottom-up control of attention, i.e., control that is based on the properties of the visual stimulus. This compares with a top-down component, which may be based not only on the content of the image but also on additional high-level features that may depend on a specific visual task at hand. An example of a top-down component would include, for example, storing an image of a face of a person one is searching for, followed by correlating that image across the entire scene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A task of the saliency map is to compute a scalar quantity representing the salience at every location in the visual field, and to guide the subsequent selection of attended locations. The &ldquo;feature maps&rdquo; provide the input to the saliency map, which is modeled as a neural network receiving its input at a particular spatial scale (here scale <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The input image <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be a digitized image from a variety of sources. In one embodiment, the digitized image may be from an NTSC video camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, linear filtering is carried out at different spatial scales, here nine spatial scales. The spatial scales may be created using Gaussian pyramid filters of the Burt and Adelson type. These pyramid filters may include progressively low pass filtering and sub-sampling of the input image. The spatial processing pyramids can have an arbitrary number of spatial scales. In the example provided, nine spatial scales provide horizontal and vertical image reduction factors ranging from 1:1 (level <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, representing the original input image) to 1:256 (level <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> ) in powers of 2. This may be used to detect differences in the image between fine and coarse scales. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Each portion of the image is analyzed by comparing the &ldquo;center&rdquo; portion of the image with the surround part of the image. Each comparison, called &ldquo;center-surround&rdquo; difference, may be carried out at multiple spatial scales indexed by the scale of the center, c, where, for example, c&equals;2, 3 or 4 in the pyramid schemes. Each one of those is compared to the scale of the surround s&equals;c&plus;d, where, for example, d is 3 or 4. This example would yield <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> feature maps for each feature at the scales <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (for instance, in the last case, the image at spatial scale <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is subtracted, after suitable normalization, from the image at spatial scale <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> ). One feature type encodes for intensity contrast, e.g., &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; intensity contrast shown as <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. This may encode for the modulus of image luminance contrast, which shows the absolute value of the difference between center intensity and surround intensity. The differences between two images at different scales may be obtained by oversampling the image at the coarser scale to the resolution of the image at the finer scale. In principle, any number of scales in the pyramids, of center scales, and of surround scales, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another feature <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> encodes for colors. With r, g and b respectively representing the red, green and blue channels of the input image, an intensity image I is obtained as I&minus;(r&plus;g&plus;b)/3. A Gaussian pyramid I(s) is created from I, where s is the scale. The r, g and b channels are normalized by I at <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, at the locations where the intensity is at least 10% of its maximum, in order to decorrelate hue from intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Four broadly tuned color channels may be created, for example as: R&equals;r&minus;(g&plus;b)/2 for red, G&equals;g&minus;(r&plus;b)/2 for green, B&equals;b&minus;(r&plus;g)/2 for blue, and Y&equals;(r&plus;g)/2&minus;&verbar;r&minus;g&verbar;/2&minus;b for yellow, where negative values are set to zero). <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> computes center-surround differences across scales. Two different feature maps may be used for color, a first encoding red-green feature maps, and a second encoding blue-yellow feature maps. Four Gaussian pyramids R(s), G(s), B(s) and Y(s) are created from these color channels. Depending on the input image, many more color channels could be evaluated in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the image sensor <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> that obtains the image of a particular scene is a multi-spectral image sensor. This image sensor may obtain different spectra of the same scene. For example, the image sensor may sample a scene in the infra-red as well as in the visible part of the spectrum. These two images may then be evaluated in a similar manner to that described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Another feature type may encode for local orientation contrast <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This may use the creation of oriented Gabor pyramids as known in the art. Four orientation-selective pyramids may thus be created from I using Gabor filtering at 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees, operating as the four features. The maps encode, as a group, the difference between the average local orientation and the center and surround scales. In a more general implementation, many more than four orientation channels could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In summary, differences between a &ldquo;center&rdquo; fine scale c and a &ldquo;surround&rdquo; coarser scales yield six feature maps for each of intensity contrast, red-green double opponency, blue-yellow double opponency, and the four orientations. A total of 42 feature maps is thus created, using six pairs of center-surround scales in seven types of features, following the example above. A different number of feature maps may be obtained using a different number of pyramid scales, center scales, surround scales, or features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> shows normalizing the features to extract salient image location from the raw center-surround maps, and to discard inconspicuous locations. This process may be critical to the operation of the system. This operation follows the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. At <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, each feature map is first normalized to a fixed dynamic range such as between 0 and 1. This may eliminate feature-dependent amplitude differences that may be due to different feature extraction mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> At each step of the iteration, the map is convolved by a large difference-of-Gaussians kernel at <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> and the results are added to the center contents of the map at <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The additional input implements the short-range excitation processes and the long-range inhibitory processes between the neighboring visual locations. The map is then half-wave rectified at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which may remove negative results. This makes the iterative process nonlinear, which may improve the results. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> where c<highlight><subscript>ex </subscript></highlight>and c<highlight><subscript>in </subscript></highlight>are positive numbers that denote the strength of the excitatory center response and the strength of the inhibitory surround response, respectively. &dgr;<highlight><subscript>ex </subscript></highlight>and &dgr;<highlight><subscript>inh </subscript></highlight>denote the width, spatial extent or size of the associated excitatory central Gaussian or the inhibitory surround Gaussian. In eq. 1, the central Gaussian is subtracted from the surround Gaussian to obtain a so-called &ldquo;Mexican-Hat&rdquo; operator or &ldquo;Difference-of-Gaussian&rdquo;, hence leading to the name &lsquo;DoG&rsquo;. This can also be seen in the central box &lsquo;<highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>&rsquo; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> At each iteration, the feature map M goes through the following transformation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>M&larr;&verbar;M&plus;M*DOG&minus;</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>inh</subscript></highlight>&verbar;&gE;&emsp;&emsp;(2)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Eq. 2 shows getting the new value of the image &lsquo;M&rsquo; by taking the current input image in map &lsquo;M&rsquo;, filtering it through this &lsquo;DOG&rsquo; filter, adding it to the existing Map &lsquo;M&rsquo;, and subtracting an inhibitory constant C<highlight><subscript>inh</subscript></highlight>. Positive results are kept; negative results are set to zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Each feature map is iterated 10 times using this equation. Different numbers of iterations may be carried out, based on experience and the application domain. The local excitation is counteracted by broad inhibition from neighboring locations. This spatial interaction across the entire map may be crucial for resolving competition among salient items. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows two different examples of the six center-surround receptive field types. The left part of the figure shows Gaussian pixel widths, numbered <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, for the <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> spatial scales used in the model example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Scale <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> corresponds to the original image, and each subsequent scale is coarser by a factor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At the coarsest scale, sigma&equals;8, almost the entire image is blurred and only very coarse objects are visible as blobs. <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> show two examples of the six center-surround receptive field types. <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> shows the scale pair <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> representing the image filtered with the filter with sigma&equals;2 being subtracted from the image filtered sigma&equals;5. <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> shows the scale pair <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The spatial competition for salience may be implemented within each of the feature maps. Each map receives input from the filtering and center surround stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> An example of results is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>H. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> shows the actual image, with iteration <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>) showing the items that are present in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> shows two iterations of the type illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to show that the salient features begin to emerge. This is shown in further detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference> (iteration <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E (iterations <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>F (iteration <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>), <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>G (iteration <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>H (iteration <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</cross-reference> representing iteration <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> clearly shows which features are most salient, and this only becomes more evident in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</cross-reference> showing the result of iteration <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Since there is not that much difference between iterations <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in this situation it is evident that the iteration can be stopped at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The net effect of the iterative process in this example was to reinforce the brightest object while suppressing the darker objects, which may embody the fact that the brightest object may be perceived as visually salient by human observers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> After normalization at <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the feature maps for intensity, color, and orientation are summed across scales into three separate &ldquo;conspicuity maps,&rdquo; <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> for intensity, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> for color and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> for orientation. Conspicuity maps for other features, such as motion or flicker, can easily be added here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Each conspicuity map is then subjected to another 10 iterations of the iterative normalization process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The motivation for the creation of three separate channels and their individual normalization is the hypothesis that similar features compete strongly for salience, while different modalities contribute independently to the saliency map. The individual normalization may provide additional information since similar features may compete strongly for salience, while different modalities may contribute independently to the saliency maps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> This &ldquo;within-feature competitive&rdquo; globally promotes the most salient portions of the feature map, both within a feature, and over the whole map. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> After this, at <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, linear combinations of these maps are taken to form the unique saliency map shown as <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. At any given time, the maximum of the saliency map may correspond to the most salient stimulus, and represents the item to which the focus of attention should next be directed. Hence, at any given time, the most salient location may be determined from the maximum of the saliency map. This may be effected at <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> using a &ldquo;winner take all&rdquo; technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Different &ldquo;winner take all&rdquo; techniques are known. However, this system may use a two-dimensional layer of integrate and fire neurons with strong global inhibition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The system as described might direct its focus of attention constantly to one location since the same winner would always be selected. Accordingly, the feedback shown as <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> is indicated to provide feedback from the &ldquo;winner take all&rdquo; array <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to the saliency map <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. That is, after some period of variable delay, the saliency of the winning location may be transiently inhibited. This assures that the &ldquo;winner take all&rdquo; circuit automatically selects the next most salient location. As a consequence, attention then switches to the next most conspicuous location. This inhibition prevents a previously attended location from being attended to again within a short interval and endows the entire algorithm with a dynamic element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The above embodiment has described comparisons between different image parts at <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which rely on simple center-surround mechanisms. These are implemented as differences between mean pixel values, across the different spatial scales, as described. However, in some situations this might not correctly detect any dissimilarity between the center and surround regions that may be present in the higher-order spatial statistics of the input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment determines higher order, e.g., second order, statistics in the image. This may be done for any of previously described purposes. For example, consider the case as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, where the center and surround are two different textures with similar means but different higher-order statistics (for instance, different variances). A simple comparison of the mean pixel values between the center and surround regions would show a low saliency, while both textures may appear quite dissimilar to human observers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment described herein takes into account not only mean value differences between center and surround, but also the statistical distribution of the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> An embodiment describes the use of second-order statistics, here the variance of pixel distribution. This technique may be used when a simple comparison of mean pixel values between center and surround regions shows a low saliency. Alternatively, this may be used for all applications of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> This system may provide a statistical measure of a difference of distributions of pixel values between the center and surrounding regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> This embodiment may assume that the pixels should be distributed in a Gaussian format. While this assumption holds for only certain kinds of images, it may still represent a better approximation than the first embodiment. However, more general statistical assumptions could also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> An example is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. An image is shown having a background area with a texture, and an elliptical area within the other background area. An observer can easily see the elliptical area within the background in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, but the average values are more or less the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a block diagram of a center-surround neuronal &ldquo;unit&rdquo; of this embodiment. This unit is comparing two different parts <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> with different textures. The unit compares the distribution of pixel values between the center <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> and surround regions <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. In the example shown, the mean pixel values are substantially identical over the center and concentric surround regions. Therefore, an operator that only considered the mean intensity in the center and subtracts that from the average intensity in the surround would obtain a value close to zero and would not find the center portion to be salient. Note that the mean of the two Gaussian distributions in the middle plot are identical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> This embodiment takes the variance as shown. The variance of the center region <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is higher than the variance <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> of the surround. The distributions of pixel values in center and surround are approximated two Gaussian functions. A statistical measure of similarity between those distributions (such as the Kullback divergence) may then be used to compute the response of the neuron at <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, such that identical distributions yield no neuronal response while very different distributions yield a strong response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The mean and standard deviation may be calculated as follows, and as shown in the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The pixel distribution is taken in a region represented by a pixel at a given level in a multiscale image pyramid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, two different image &ldquo;pyramids&rdquo;, are created, that is two sets of images filtered at different resolutions, of sigmas in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Each pyramid accumulates the sum and the sum of the squares of all the pixels up to the chosen level of the pyramids. That is, at a given level n in the sum pyramid, each pixel is the sum of the pixel values x<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>of the (d<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>corresponding pixels at the base level of the pyramid, where d is the scaling between levels in the pyramid. In the specific implementation, d&equals;2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The sum-of-squares pyramid is similar except that an image of the sum of the squares of the pixel values in the original image is used as the base of the pyramid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> This data is already calculated and stored in two pyramids. Therefore the mean and standard deviation for any pixel at level n in the pyramid can be easily calculated as

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, saliency is then derived from a comparison between this mean and standard deviation for the center and surrounding regions. The saliency may use other similar measures including Euclidean distance between the mean-standard deviation pair, ideal-observer discrimination, and the Kullback J-divergence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> This higher order comparison may not only be applied to the intensity channel, but also to color opponencies and orientation-selective channels or to any other channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> graphically illustrates the computation of mean and variance of pixel distribution within increasingly larger square regions, using an image pyramid architecture. From the original input image <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, two dyadic image pyramids are created. In the sum pyramid on the left, each pixel at a given level &ldquo;n&rdquo; contains the sum of all corresponding pixels at level <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (the original image). In the second one (right), each pixel at level &ldquo;n&rdquo; contains the sum of squares of all corresponding pixels at level <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Another improvement may include improved detection of center-surround differences by contour identification. Detection of salient contours involves the elaboration of a subset of elongated contours in the image. Image contour detection can be done with standard image processing techniques, such as by using Canny edge-detection filtering. Several techniques have been proposed for the detection of salient contours. The present technique uses a multiscale approach which is flowcharted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and shown graphically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, contours and edges of the image are detected at multiple spatial scales using oriented Gabor filters which may be set to take account of contours in both local neighborhoods as well as contours across the entire image. This takes note that a longer contour or edge, even if interrupted, may represent a more salient image feature than shorter image segments, even if they are continuous and non-interrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, at any given spatial scale, neighboring locations interact such that edge elements at a given orientation which appear to form a contour reinforce each other. This provides the raw map &ldquo;M&rdquo; containing Gabor edge detection results at a given spatial scale, with values scaled between <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. These values are iterated as follows. At <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, the image is convolved with an excitatory filter mask, yielding a new map &ldquo;E&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight>, the value 1 is added to E. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> saturates values&gt;1.25 to avoid explosion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The raw map M is multiplied by E at <highlight><bold>925</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight>, M is convolved by a difference of Gaussian filter, yielding I </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight>, a small constant k is added to I which implements a global inhibitory bias, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> AT <highlight><bold>945</bold></highlight>, I is added to M, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight>, negative values in M are eliminated by setting them to zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Note that this is a non-linear process, since saturation is applied at one end, and negative values are eliminated at the other end. At <highlight><bold>955</bold></highlight>, this non-linear process <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> is iterated a few times (on the order of 10 iterations), hence implementing a recurrent non-linear scheme with early termination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference> shows parameters defining the field of influence between two nearby visual neurons, as found in typical single-spatial scale models of contour integration. The actual image <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is filtered by banks of orientation-selective filters <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. These filters may approximate neuronal responses for several orientations and at several spatial scales <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, not taking into account any interaction. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference> shows characterizing interactions between distant filters according to separating distance and angles. In typical models, this may yield a &ldquo;field of influence&rdquo; which defines the location, preferred orientation and connection strength between a central neuron of interest and its neighbors. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</cross-reference> shows this field of influence Results obtained with this technique for each map M are then combined at <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight>, first across spatial scales for one orientation, and then across orientations as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Local oriented features are first extracted at multiple spatial scales and for multiple orientations (here four orientations at 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees). The iterative competition for salience and contour integration process described in the previous figure is then applied to each resulting feature map (here represented only for one map, at the right). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The result is a single saliency map which contains not only small, localized salient objects as detected with the basic technique described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but also extended contours if those are salient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The above has described operation with static images. An important extension of the above operates to provide a new feature channel for detection of salience in moving images in a video sequence. The operation may use the flowchart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>, visual motion from a sequence of images (acquired, for instance, via a video camera) is extracted. This may use the Spatio Temporal Energy model that has previously been described by Adelson and Bergen. However, many other motion algorithms could also be used here. Briefly, this may apply three-dimensional (x, y, t) band-pass filters to the sequence of frames. Each filter detects motion in a given direction and at a given speed. Note that this filter is a type of orientation filter but in space-time instead of in two-dimensional spatial plane. A bank of such filters are provided and are tuned to motion in different directions such as up, down and left and right, and at different velocities, i.e., x pixels per frame. If we assume 4 directions, and three speeds, then 12 filters per image location are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>, this motion extraction module is applied to the luminance (Y) and chrominance (C) channels of the image at several spatial scales, yielding one &ldquo;motion map&rdquo; for each orientation, velocity and scale. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> carries out non-linear spatial competition for salience, as described previously, with respect to each resulting motion map. That is, the motion saliency of multiple objects, moving roughly in the same direction and speed, is evaluated by the competitive and iterative process described above. Again, this step is crucial for evaluating the saliency of more than one object that moves in a similar direction and speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1215</bold></highlight>, all the maps for a given orientation and velocity (and several spatial scales) are summed into one summary map for that orientation and velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, all those maps are then summed using the non-linear spatial competition process, and then at <highlight><bold>1225</bold></highlight>, all the summary maps are summed. The final result of the non-linear spatial competition process is obtained at <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> This system is used for detecting saliency in the motion channel. A nonlinear within-feature competition scheme is used to detect motion in luminance and also in chrominance in a multiscale manner. This provides one motion map for each of orientation, velocity and scale for each of luminance and chrominance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The nonlinear spatial competition system then is used for each resulting motion map. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment recognizes that the Adelson-Bergen or spatio-temporal image filters are specialized to pick up motion. Classic motion detectors do not respond to flicker in the image since nothing is moving in any direction. Hence, an additional filter may be added which provides a temporal derivative channel to pick up the flicker. Hence, this embodiment looks at flicker in animated sequences. This may be of particular relevance for evaluating the saliency of web-pages or marquette advertising or electronic displays with flashing LEDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Take an example of a light turning on and off, without moving, just flashing. This most certainly attracts attention. Yet Adelson-Bergen motion detectors do not respond to flicker, since nothing is moving in any one particular direction. A temporal derivative channel may be used to pick up flicker and integrate the derivative into saliency. An embodiment is shown in the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, the absolute value of the temporal derivative of the image intensity in computed. Since an increase in light should be as salient as a decrease in light intensity, any changes in this value, whether positive or negative, are relevant </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight>, this absolute difference value is thresholded, and compared against the threshold. That is, if the change in image intensity is too small, it is not considered, since it might be produced by noise. Other temporal information may be calculated at <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight>, such as taking the derivative of colors, e.g. the red-green or blue-yellow color channels, with respect to time. Again, the absolute value of the temporal derivative in the red-green and in the blue-yellow color channels can be considered. At <highlight><bold>1315</bold></highlight>, a test is made to determine if the change is over the whole image. If so, then the process stops. This is based on the recognition that flickering of the entire image may not be very salient. For example, simply turning room lights quickly on and off might not be very salient. This can be carried out using spatial competitive interactions as in the other channels. At <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>, the image portion that flickers is identified as salient, or increased in salience according to results of the iterative competition process applied to the flicker map. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment for a flicker saliency channel hence may include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> a basic rectified flicker extraction module based on taking the absolute value of the difference between two successive frames. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> its application to several spatial scales and in several image modalities (luminance, chrominance, etc). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> the application of a non-linear spatial competition for salience mechanism within each resulting flicker map. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> the summation of all the maps for a given modality (and several scales) into one summary map for that modality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> the application on those summary maps of the non-linear spatial competition process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> the summation of all summary maps </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> the application on the final result of the non-linear spatial competition process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The above system evaluates saliency based on images obtained using a classical red-green-blue representation. This gives rise to two opponency channels (red-green and blue-yellow), an intensity channels, and four orientation channels. These seven channels are processed in separate computational streams. This can be extended to many more channels. Such multi-spectral or hyper-spectral image sensors may include near and far infra-red cameras, visible light cameras, synthetic aperture radar and so on. With images comprising large numbers of spectral bands, e.g., up to hundreds of channels in some futuristic military scenarios, significant redundancies will exist across different spectral bands. The saliency system can therefore be used to model more sophisticated interactions between spectral channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> This may be achieved by implementing connections across channels whereby each feature map at a given scale can receive multiplicative excitatory or inhibitory input from another feature map at the same or different spatial scale. These connections extend the interactive spatial competition for salience already implemented in the saliency model: at each time step, spatial interactions within each map may be iterated, followed by one iteration of interactions across maps. Supervised training algorithms can be applied to include training of the weights by which the different channels interact. The resulting system may be able to exploit multi-spectral imagery in a much more sophisticated manner than is currently possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The above has described different ways of carrying out detection of the image saliency. The importance is that when exposure to an image or a sequence of images is short, attention of the (casual) observer is primarily deployed autonomously onto the locations which are most perceptually salient. A close approximation to the perceptual salience at every visual location allows a designer to optimize their work for notice by users. One application of such detection is in the field of advertising. It has been noted by the inventors that users do not perceive all components of a visual environment to be equally interesting. This may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of an advertising model. Hence, the embodiment is described which uses a computer to provide an automatic, objective, and quantitative tool by which the impact of advertising designs can be tested. This may be used on any image, moving or static, including, for example, web pages, billboards, magazine covers, TV commercials, or any medium to which the target audience may be briefly exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> This may be used to calculate saliency/conspicuity of items which are being displayed, for example, in an advertising context. This may include advertisements, visual art and text in print (magazines, news-papers, journals, books); posters, bill-boards and other outside, environmental displays; advertisements, visual art and text in electronic format on the world-wide-web or on computers; as well as the saliency/conscipicuity of dynamic advertisements, visual art and clips in movies, TV film, videos, dynamic display boards or graphical user interfaces. It may also be used for the saliency/conspicuity of displays of products placed in shop windows, department stores, aisles and shelves, printed ads and so on for product placement. That is, given a particular product (e.g. a soda brand, wine bottle, candy bar), the software evaluates its saliency within the entire display by taking account of the entire view as would be seen by a casual observer or shopper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The software can also determine how to change the visual appearance of the product, including its shape and its label, in order to increase its saliency. It can do so by providing specific information to the user on which features, at which spatial scales, are more or less salient than the object or location that the user wishes to draw the attention of the viewer to. For instance, say the user wishes to draw the eye of the viewer to a specific brand of candy bars in an array of candy bars, chocolates and other sweets. By inspecting the conspicuity maps for color, orientation and intensity (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the user can get a first impression of which objects in the scene are salient because of an intensity difference, because of a color difference or because of their spatial orientation relative to the background. Further information can be provided by having the user inspect the entire pyramid for the different color and orientation maps. Now the user can discover at what particular spatial scale any one object or location in the image is most salient. This can then guide how the user should rearrange the candy display (or the ad) in order to maximize the desired object&apos;s saliency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The above techniques have taught multiple ways of determining which part of the many maps representing the image has a maximum salience. This can be done from features, feature dimensions, and evaluation of the features at multiple spatial scales. The techniques of increasing the salience effectively uses a search process through parameter space. For example, each parameter may be varied in each direction to determine if that part of the image becomes more salient or less salient. A part of the image, for example, could be made a little redder. Once doing so, an evaluation of whether the saliency increases is made. If the saliency does increase from that change, then the image can be made redder still. This can be continued until the maximum saliency from that parameter is obtained. By carrying out a search process through parameter space, different parts of the image can be made more or less salient. The search process can be carried out through feature channels including any of the feature channels noted above, and through different scales. The parameter is changed systematically throughout each of these values to determine the effect on saliency, allowing the saliency of different parts of the image to be manipulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> An additional aspect learns from the way in which images are made more salient. From this &ldquo;experience&rdquo;, the system may use a conventional learning system to write rules which say, in a certain kind of the image/background/space, do a certain operation in order to increase the salience of the image portion. This automated system hence provides rules or preferences which can increase the salience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Applications within the military, intelligence and security community which require (semi)-automatic evaluation of salient images to detect construction activities, evidence for burials, missile tests, intruders alert or the detection of humans in surveillance applications who behave &ldquo;conspicuously&rdquo; are also envisioned. In particular, this application may include multi-spectral images (where not only three color channels but possibly hundreds of different spectral images are combined in a similar manner to yield saliency) as well as moving imagery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> For applications in the robotic domain, the software can alert (semi)-autonomously moving robotic device of salient locations in the environment that need to be further inspected by a high-resolution sensory system or by a human observer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> This model may predict were casual observers will place their attention. For example, this could either be done as a service, where ad people send their ad to the service, and the service analyzes it and sends it back with an analysis of its saliency. Another paradigm is a web-based service where people submit images and the software automatically determines the first, second, third etc. most salient locations. The paradigm can also be carried out on a computer such as a PDA with attached camera. The software runs on this hand-held device as a sort of &ldquo;saliency meter&rdquo; for determining the saliency of, for example, a product display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments are within the disclosed invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention, (Technical Field): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process for production of boron nitride powders exhibiting smooth spherical morphology, spheroidal particles with &ldquo;bladed&rdquo; surface morphology, spheroidal particles with protruding &ldquo;whiskers,&rdquo; and fully &ldquo;bladed&rdquo; particles with platelet morphology, and particles having turbostratic or hexagonal crystal structure. The process utilizes aerosol assisted vapor phase synthesis (AAVS), nitriding organoboron precursors through a boron oxide nitride intermediary composition, to form spherical and modified spherical boron nitride powders. The process can be achieved through use of an aerosol assisted vapor phase reactor system (AAVRS), and it has significant use in preparation of the preferred spheroidal boron nitride powders for use in the microelectronic, polymer, and cosmetic industries as well as in traditional ceramic markets (e.g., aerospace and automotive products). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Art: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Boron nitride (BN) is a well-known, commercially produced refractory non-oxide ceramic material. Boron nitride properties are highly dependent on its crystalline structure. The most common structure for BN is a hexagonal crystal structure. This structure is similar to the carbon structure for graphite, consisting of extended two-dimensional layers of edge-fused six-membered (BN)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>rings. The rings arrange in crystalline form where B atoms in the rings in one layer are above and below N atoms in neighboring layers and vice versa (i.e., the rings are shifted positionally with respect to layers). The intraplanar B&mdash;N bonding in the fused six-membered rings is strongly covalent while the interplanar B&mdash;N bonding is weak, similar to graphite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Historically, commercial boron nitride articles have been prepared by hot pressing BN powders obtained from classical metallurgical high-temperature synthesis (e.g., boric acid treated with urea at 1000&deg; C., &ldquo;hot-pressed BN&rdquo;; or BN obtained by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth, &ldquo;pyrolytic BN&rdquo;). Pyrolytic BN is considered the more typical form in the industry, given the absence of binders and improved crystallinity and grain features. (Unless otherwise indicated, properties of BN described in these background materials are representative of pyrolytic BN.) Under these typical solid state synthesis conditions, BN is typically obtained as a mixture of meso-graphitic and turbostratic modifications that contain varying degrees of disorder of the ideal hexagonal BN structure (h-BN). Fully ordered h-BN is only obtained with careful attention to synthetic detail. (Paine, RT, Narula, CK. Synthetic Routes to Boron Nitride. <highlight><italic>Chem. Rev. </italic></highlight>90: 73-91, 1990.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Commercial applications for h-BN are well established in several traditional ceramic markets. In particular, the high temperature stability, chemical inertness, lubricity, electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity make BN powders ideal for fabrication of products used in aerospace, automotive and microelectronic products, including large crucibles, heat sinks, mold liners and electrical insulators. Unlike carbon, h-BN is a colorless or (in cases where impurities are present with defect states in the electronic band gap) white material. In its powder form, it can be processed by classical powder forming methods into simple and complex shapes. Since it is soft, hot pressed bodies can be easily machined. In the absence of oxygen and moisture, BN is stable above 2000&deg; C.; however, it combusts in oxygen near 900&deg; C. The layered, hexagonal crystal structure results in anisotropic physical properties that make this material unique in the overall collection of non-oxide ceramics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Examples of various known or attempted methods to produce spheroidal BN through hexagonal modification include several high-temperature, metallurgical or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactions. (Paine, RT, Narula, CK. Synthetic Routes to Boron Nitride. <highlight><italic>Chem. Rev. </italic></highlight>90: 73-91, 1990.) From the commercial standpoint, h-BN is obtained as a powder most often from multi-step processes that employ boric oxide, sodium borate or boric acid as the boron raw material and urea, melamine and/or ammonia as the nitriding source. These reactions are driven by the thermodynamic stability of BN and the reducing nitridation conditions that remove impurities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Carbothermal reduction conditions also can be employed to remove oxygen. Commercial powder producers manipulate reaction conditions in order to achieve target powder purity, grain size, sinterability and crystallinity. These features, in turn, influence powder processibility and finished product performance. It is important to note that commercial powders are usually obtained either as agglomerates having irregular morphology or as primary particles with a platelet morphology. The latter is a macroscopic manifestation of the inherent crystal structure of h-BN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Recently, interest in inorganic ceramic/organic polymer composites containing BN powders for thermal management applications has arisen. It has been suggested in the art that a spherical morphology BN powder would be useful to enhance powder processing of polymers. However, a commercial source of such powders is not available. One known process to obtain small, laboratory-scale samples of spheroidal BN involves reacting trichloroborazine with an aminosilane to form a polymer that dissolves in liquid ammonia (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). The resulting solution may be used to form an aerosol containing poly(borazinylamine). The aerosol is then passed through a reaction furnace to produce a boron nitride powder composed of primary particles having spherical morphology. Further nitridation in an NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere at a temperature of 1600&deg; C., over a period of time of at least eight hours, gives h-BN particles of overall spheroidal shape with protruding non-uniform blades. This process is not commercially viable since it requires the use of an expensive, commercially unavailable polymer that is made only from an expensive commercially unavailable monomer. (Lindquist, DA et al. Boron Nitride Powders Formed by Aerosol Decomposition of Poly(borazinylamine) Solutions. <highlight><italic>J. Am. Ceram. Soc. </italic></highlight>74 (12) 3126-28, 1991.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As another example, a second method reacts boron trichloride with ammonia, a combination typically used to make platelet morphology h-BN by CVD. The resulting powders are treated at high temperature in a graphite furnace under vacuum. (The patent suggests formation of spherical primary particles although no evidence of the actual morphology is provided.) This process, if successful, is not commercially attractive due to the expense of the starting material, BCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and the formation of a corrosive by-product HCl that tends to leave chloride impurities in powders. (European Patent Office Publication No. 0 396 448.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A third and potentially more practical process for the formation of spherical morphology h-BN powders utilizes a process where an aerosol is generated from a saturated (0.9M) aqueous solution of boric acid. The aerosol is passed into a heated tubular reactor where it is nitrided by NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in a temperature range of between 600&deg; C. and 1500&deg; C., preferably between 1000&deg; C. and 1200&deg; C. A powder product, BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>, is collected that contains significant amounts of oxygen, typically between 40 wt. % to 55 wt. %. The primary particles have spherical particle diameters in the range 0.1 micron to 5 microns. These powders are subsequently nitrided in a second stage in a temperature range of between 1000&deg; C. to 1700&deg; C. under a flowing stream of NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The oxygen contents of the resulting boron nitride powders are less than 4 wt. % and the particles retain the spherical morphology. (Pruss et al., Aerosol Assisted Vapor Synthesis of Spherical Boron Nitride Powders. <highlight><italic>Chem. Mater. </italic></highlight>12(1), 19-21, 2000; U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,179 to Pruss et al.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Although the process described by Pruss et al. is practically useful for the production of spherical morphology BN powders, it possesses several drawbacks, including: (a) large amounts of water are injected into the tubular reaction zone in the form of aerosol droplets thereby diluting the NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>reactant that is required for nitridation of H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>BO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>dissolved in the aqueous aerosol droplets; (b) the large amounts of injected water act as a back-reactant with BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>aerosol powders; (c) water is also formed as a reaction byproduct in the first stage aerosol nitridation; (d) the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>powders formed in the first-stage nitridation reaction contain large amounts of oxygen; (e) the large amounts of oxygen are difficult to remove in the second-stage nitridation; and (f) there is significant loss of boron as a volatile component during the nitridation process. Due to these drawbacks alternative solventless or non-aqueous solvent-based aerosol chemical systems have been sought in the industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Very few readily available, inexpensive boron reagents exist that are soluble in a non-aqueous solvent appropriate for aerosol formation or aerosol pyrolysis. Similarly, there are very few inexpensive, liquid-phase boron reagents that might be employed directly without a solvent to generate an aerosol. However, at least one family of boron reagents does exist that is commercially available in large quantities at relatively low cost and is soluble in non-aqueous solvents: trialkoxyboranes or trialkylborates, (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B (e.g., R&equals;Me(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), Et(C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>), Pr(C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), Bu(C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>)). These are free-flowing liquids at 23&deg; C. In addition, there is evidence in the literature that suggests that trialkylborates, (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B, react with the common nitriding reagent ammonia, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,629,732, discloses that (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B (R&equals;lower mol. wt. alkyl groups preferably CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) reacts with NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in a 1:1 ratio in the gas phase at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature to give adducts, (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B.NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Further, other examples in the literature describe a reaction of (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>O)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B with NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>that is claimed to form an adduct (MeO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B.NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>that sublimes at 45&deg; C. and allegedly is stable to at least 375&deg; C. (Goubeau et al., <highlight><italic>Z. Anorg. Allgem. Chem. </italic></highlight>266, 161-174, 1951.) Goubeau et al. also describe reactions that employ other reactant ratios which produce complex product mixtures that are not identified. The chemistry is proposed to involve elimination of methanol and dimethyl ether. U.S. Pat. No. 2,824,787 to May et al. claims the formation of BN from pyrolysis of a gas mixture of (MeO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>at a furnace temperature above about 850&deg; C. The resulting product is a white powder containing B, N, O, C, and H in varying amounts depending upon reaction conditions. This powder is then heated in NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>atmosphere to 900&deg;-1100&deg; C. to obtain BN. The &apos;787 patent does not describe the morphology and crystallinity of the BN. However, it is likely that these processes produce BN with the traditional platelet morphology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Further, in a series of patents, Bienert et al. describe the formation of boron-nitrogen-hydrogen compounds, BN<highlight><subscript>3&minus;x</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6&minus;3x</subscript></highlight>, from the reaction of boron halides or basic acid esters with NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in a heated gas flow tube held at 200&deg; C. or 500&deg; C. The resulting compounds are claimed to be useful for making detrition-resistant boron nitride pressed bodies, boron nitride powder and semiconduction components. (Bienert et al., Ger. Offen. No. 1,943,581; Ger. Offen. No. 1,943,582; Ger. Offen. No. 2,004,360; U.S. Pat. No. 3,711,594.) Finally, Murakawa et al. describe the use of (EtO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B in a hot gas stream of air and methane to form B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and C. A powder compact was subsequently heated at 900&deg; C. in N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. It was claimed that h-BN with spherical morphology (ave. diameter, approximately 0.14 micron) formed. (Japanese Patent No. JP60,200,811 to Kokai et al.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> There remains a real need in the art for a process yielding spherical h-BN in high concentration without high oxygen impurities, utilizing commonly available, inexpensive precursors such as trialkylborates. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a method for an aerosol assisted vapor phase synthesis (AAVS) process of boron nitride (BN) wherein organoboron precursors are nitrided in one or two heating steps, and wherein a boron oxide nitride intermediary composition is formed after the first heating step and is further nitrided to form resultant spheroidal boron nitride powders including spheroidal particles that are smooth, bladed, have protruding whiskers, and are of turbostratic or hexagonal crystalline structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The process of the present invention, forming a boron-nitrogen-oxygen-carbon-hydrogen intermediate composition and forming from such composition the desired spherically shaped or modified spherical BN powder having either a turbostratic (t-BN) or a hexagonal (h-BN) crystal structure, as more particularly described herein, preferably includes the following steps: (1) introducing a liquid boron reagent precursor into an aerosol generator, (2) creating an aerosol of the precursor reagent liquid by using an aerosol generator, (3) using an inert carrier gas to sweep the aerosol droplets generated into a furnace, (4) injecting a gaseous nitriding agent (or a nitriding agent aerosol on a carrier gas) into the furnace, (5) maintaining the temperature of the furnace within a temperature range of approximately 600&deg; C. to approximately 1800&deg; C., and (6) collecting the resultant intermediate, BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powder particles. Additional steps of the method may be utilized, including (7) heat-treating the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>precursor particles after step <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> or step <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> at approximately 600&deg; C. to approximately 1800&deg; C. under nitriding conditions, and then (8) collecting the fully nitrided particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The aerosol assisted vapor phase reactor system apparatus for forming spherical BN as described above typically comprises an aerosol generator (capable of producing an aerosol spray of droplets of the preferred liquid trialkylborate, (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B, precursor compound or a non-aqueous solution of the same), a means for injecting a gas stream composed of liquid reagent droplets in an inert carrier gas into a heated reactor tube at a controlled flow rate, and a means for injecting a gaseous nitriding agent (or liquid nitriding agent on an inert carrier gas) separately into the furnace (preferably substantially simultaneously to the injection of the reagent/carrier gas aerosol). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, a schematic diagram of an aerosol assisted vapor phase reactor system (AAVRS) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used in accordance with the method of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The AAVRS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> depicted is a &ldquo;bench scale&rdquo; system, but the methods of the present invention additionally apply to an apparatus on a commercial scale. AAVRS <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises aerosol generator assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, inert carrier gas source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, nitriding source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, connection systems <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime;, furnace <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and preferably, collection device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Generator assembly <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably comprises ultrasonic transducer assembly <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Other generator assemblies may be utilized, including but not limited to spray nozzles, nebulizers, and atomizers. It should be understood that many different aerosol generator geometries may be employed as the droplet generator. The selection of a particular aerosol or droplet generator and droplet delivery system or geometry will preferably depend upon the AAVRS type and size, target droplet size, droplet size distribution, droplet delivery rate and chemical composition of the droplet. For example, an impactor (e.g., barrier) may be inserted in-line in the delivery system to modify the particle size distribution and decrease the delivery rate. Different spray nozzle designs may be employed to vary the size of the droplets and different additives can be added to the (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B or other organoboron precursor to modify the surface tension of the reagent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Transducer assembly <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> preferably comprises humidifier base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, glass chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, diaphragm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and ultrasonic transducer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Humidifier base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contains transducer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and may be a preformed commercial unit (e.g., Holmes Model 643B). Water or another suitable liquid fills base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, contacting both diaphragm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and transducer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As best depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, glass chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> contains precursor liquid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> during use. The preferred precursor liquid comprises an alkylborate, most preferably a trialkylborate. It is preferred that a trimethylborate, (MeO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B, be utilized as the boron precursor liquid for the formation of dense BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>particles of low O and C content. Triethylborate, (EtO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B, truisopropylborate, (<highlight><superscript>i</superscript></highlight>PrO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B, and other trialkylborates utilizing simple organic side groups (e.g., C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) may be used in the present invention, and these compounds are preferred for cases where larger C contents can be tolerated or are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Glass chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may comprise multiple configurations including, but not limited to the flask shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Glass chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises at least one outlet <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in connected relation to connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;. Connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; is disposed between chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and furnace <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Glass chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> additionally comprises at least one inlet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in connected relation to connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed in connected relation between chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and inert gas source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Additional inlets such as inlets <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>&Prime; depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, may also be utilized to connect additional inert gas sources or for continuous or batch transfer of precursor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, multiple lines of connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be utilized when multiple inlets or outlets are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Diaphragm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably comprised of a thin, flexible material such as polyethylene, which has a suitable tension for transmitting ultrasonic energy from an emitter source <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to liquid precursor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> contained within glass chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>). Preferably, diaphragm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will also be comprised of a suitably inert material with respect to the utilized precursor. Other polymers may be suitable for the diaphragm material, provided they comprise a suitable tension and are chemically inert to the precursor. As a result, other such materials known in the art may be utilized for the diaphragm. Diaphragm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is stretched fittingly over bottom <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of glass chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and may be attached with means known in the art, such as but not limited to, a fitted ring. Diaphragm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably positioned in relation to transducer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for best sonic transmission, preferably with transducer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> immediately proximate to diaphragm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and centrally positioned, but leaving a small gap as is commonly known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Ultrasonic transducer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is mounted in humidifier base <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and preferably comprises a piezoelectric crystal, but may comprise other transducers known in the art. Transducer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is electrically stimulated, thereby creating ultrasonic stimulation of diaphragm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Diaphragm <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> transmits the ultrasonic energy to precursor liquid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, thereby creating an aerosol of precursor liquid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Other aerosol generator configurations known in the art may be utilized in performing the methods of the present invention. Additionally, multiple generators may be utilized. However, it is preferred that the amount of aerosol generated by such generators be proportioned to the size of the reactor furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Inert carrier gas source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> typically comprises a gas tank or chamber containing inert gas or gas mixture, such as but not limited to N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and Ar. Other inert gases and mixtures thereof known in the art may also be utilized in the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, inert carrier gas source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprising tubes, connected chambers, pipes, or other delivery mechanisms known in the art, and disposed between source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The carrier gas is injected into aerosol chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (containing liquid boron precursor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) at inlet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>&prime; or <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>&Prime; as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. If multiple chambers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and/or sources <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are utilized, more inlets may be used. It is preferred that at least two inlets or one valved inlet (wherein precursors and various inert gas flows may alternately be blocked or allowed passage past the valve, thereby alternating flow of precursor or inert gas into the chamber) be available and/or used to provide for a suitable flow of the carrier gas, accommodating differing aerosol densities within the aerosol chamber. Spacing between inlets need not be uniform, but may vary. Varied spacing may be useful for different inlet purposes. For example, on a multiple-inlet chamber (such as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), bottom inlet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is typically used to batch transfer the precursor into the chamber. Upper inlets <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>&Prime; may be used for flow of carrier gas to mix with different density levels of aerosol (e.g., the lower the height of the aerosol within the chamber, the higher the density of the aerosol). The carrier gas serves to transport aerosol droplets of precursor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into furnace <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, by carrying the aerosol droplets through connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;, disposed between chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and furnace <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the flow rate of the carrier gas through connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; corresponds to the flow rate of the carrier gas through connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Nitriding gas source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> typically comprises a gas tank or chamber containing a nitrogen-containing gas or gas mixture known in the art, preferably NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The nitrogen-containing gas mixture may comprise a liquid or solution suitable for nitriding that is aerolized and therefore utilizes an inert carrier gas for flow into the furnace. Nitriding gas source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected to furnace <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime;. In alternate embodiments, connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, additionally flows from inert carrier gas source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to furnace <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, for direct flow of the inert gas into furnace <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. While this is not critical to the AAVS process described herein, it is helpful in the process, for example, in maintaining a gas flow pressure to &ldquo;push&rdquo; the remaining aerosol into the furnace after the aerosol generator has been turned off, thereby stopping its pressured flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Connection systems <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime;, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; join to a gas tight end cap disposed in the proximate end of furnace tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of furnace <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The carrier gas, carrying the aerosol droplets, flows through connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; into tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Preferably, at essentially the same time, the nitriding gas is separately injected into furnace tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through connection system <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime; at a flow rate preferably approximately proportional to the flow rate of carrier gas. In alternate embodiments, different flow rates may be utilized. The flow rate may comprise a flow proportion of between approximately 10:1 of NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to approximately 1:20 of NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>It is preferred, however, that the flow rate comprise a flow proportion of between approximately 1:1 of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to approximately 1:10 N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The nitriding gas mixes inside reactor tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with the aerosol droplets of boron precursor liquid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, leading to a series of reactions which form particles of BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>, the boron nitride precursor intermediate structure as more completely described infra. The particles of BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>will preferably exhibit spherical shape provided the aerosol droplets are formed and the furnace is heated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> All connection systems <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&Prime;, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; may comprise tubes, connected chambers, pipes, or other delivery mechanisms known in the art. Connection systems may additionally comprise valves for blocking and/or controlling the flow of the carrier gas, as well as check valves to prevent backward flow. Further, connection systems may comprise joints (e.g., elbow joints), connectors (e.g., T-connectors), and affixing means known to the art (e.g., threaded insertion ends, couplings, etc.), as well as multiple flow lines per each system (e.g., when multiple inlets or outlets are used on connected structures). Finally, the connection systems may additionally comprise mechanical or computerized gauge and check systems for monitoring and controlling the flow of gas manually or automatically which may be interconnected with any mechanical or computerized gauge and and/or check systems for monitoring and controlling the furnace temperature and gas volume within the furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Flow for both the nitriding gas source and the inert carrier gas source may comprise a wide range of flow rates that are generally at least somewhat dependent on the furnace type used. The furnace used may be a commercial or a bench scale model. An example of a bench scale model furnace that may be used is a Lindbergh Model 54779, fitted with a nominal 4&Prime; diameter&times;6&prime; length reactor tube. A preferred combination range for flow rates of the nitriding gas and carrier gas used for this particular bench scale model furnace, including flow rate, is approximately 0.2 L/min N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;approximately 0.2 L/min NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>to approximately 2 L/min N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&plus;approximately 6 L/min NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Other flow rates may be used as discussed supra, especially on commercial scale model furnaces. The most preferred gas mixtures and proportions are ones with N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>ratios less than 1. Ratios of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>greater than 1 typically result in reduced nitriding characteristics (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). Other less preferred reactants that may be utilized as a nitriding source include nitrogen, nitrogen/hydrogen mixtures, alkyl amines, hydrazine, cyanamide, and dicyanamide, hydroxyl amine, or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In the preferred method, furnace <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be heated to a temperature of between approximately 600&deg; C. and approximately 1800&deg; C., preferably between approximately 1200&deg; C. and approximately 1800&deg; C. This causes reactions between the boron containing aerosol droplets (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B and the nitriding gas, forming the intermediate precursor product, BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>, as set forth in the following generalized reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>a&Circlesolid;(RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B&plus;b&Circlesolid;NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rarr;c&Circlesolid;BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> where a, b, and c are&gt;0; x, y, z are&gt;0; and R comprises an alkyl group having C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The resultant compound may also comprise hydrogen atoms, thereby forming a composition, BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>q</subscript></highlight>, however, for the purposes of this application, such a composition is considered to be within the references to the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>composition, therefore all references in the description and claims to the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>composition are understood to include BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>q </subscript></highlight>compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph showing the spherical particle shape of the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>particles in a sample obtained with a furnace temperature of 1500&deg; C. and flow rates of 0.5 L/min (N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and 0.5 L/min (NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>; a line graph depicting BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>Powder Oxygen Concentration (% wt.) v. AAVS Process Temperature under the same conditions is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. These spherical precursor particles are carried by the inert carrier/nitriding gas stream through the furnace where the particles are captured on an impact filter, a bag filter assembly, or other known capturing device <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The filter unit is opened and the powder is collected through conventional methods well known in the art. Collected samples are preferably inserted into another furnace (not shown) for additional nitriding/calcining. This is preferably done in an ammonia-rich (or other nitriding agent rich) atmosphere at a furnace temperature of between 600&deg; C. and 1800&deg; C. to form dense BN particles of spherical shape with an B:N ratio of approximately 1:1, and having a hexagonal or turbostratic structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The time and temperature of additional nitridation/calcination and post-nitriding determine the residual oxygen and carbon contents and, consequently, the final degree of crystallinity of the BN product. However, it has been further discovered in accordance with the present invention that the nitridation/calcination time and temperature are inversely proportional. Accordingly, the heat treatment time may be shortened by proportionally raising the nitridation/calcination temperature. The heat treatment step may or may not change the spherical morphology of the BN particles, depending on the nitridation/calcination conditions. It is also possible to skip the collection step and feed the initially produced gas stream containing BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powder into a second, separately heated tubular reactor where final nitridation takes place. Finally, it is also possible to use a vertical furnace configuration (with or without counter current gas/aerosol flow) thereby extending the aerosol residence time in the reactor so that spherical morphology or related morphologies are obtained in a single stage, without second stage calcination, to give hexagonal or turbostratic BN. It is possible to perform such a &ldquo;one-step&rdquo; reaction in a horizontal furnace as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, however, it is anticipated that the yield will render greater impurities, wherein &ldquo;impurities&rdquo; are viewed as BN structures not having a spheriodal structure or additional elements other than boron or nitrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the temperature of the furnace in the AAVS (during the first heating step, stage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) affects the powder O and C contents. For example, temperatures below 600&deg; C. produce high O and C contents and irregular particle morphology. At 600&deg; C., spherical powders with O content of approximately 40 wt. % and C content of approximately 1% are typically produced. The oxygen content then dramatically decreases with increasing reactor tube temperature above 600&deg; C. (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, depicting a series of typical experiments performed between 800&deg; C. and 1500&deg; C. with N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 0.5 L/min and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 0.5 L/min). When the reactor atmosphere is richer in NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, the oxygen content of the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powder also decreases with increasing reactor tube temperature as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (where N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was approximately 1 L/min, and NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>was approximately 3 L/min) despite the concomitant shorter aerosol residence times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The flow rate of the gases can also be varied with flow controllers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to alter the residence time of the particles in the furnace and/or to change the mole fraction of the primary nitriding gas, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, relative to the carrier gas, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The flow rates can be either increased or decreased depending on the residence time desired. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, when the reactor tube temperature is held at 1400&deg; C. and total gas flow rate is set at 4 L/min, as the NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>mole fraction increases, the weight percent oxygen of the resulting BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>drops off dramatically from about 26% to less than 10%. Similar trends appear with other reactor temperatures. Therefore, a ratio of N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>less than or equal to 1 is preferred. However, in alternate embodiments, ratios greater than 1 may be utilized in order to make a BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>having higher oxygen and carbon contents, when desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The need for the use of a &ldquo;second&rdquo; heating step to further nitride the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powder when a &ldquo;purer&rdquo; BN end product is desired is shown by BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powder characterization by bulk elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These data confirm that the Stage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (after the first heating step) AAVS runs produce spherical morphology BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powders that have a low degree of crystalline order or are turbostratic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in order to remove the remaining O and C impurities and increase the powder crystallinity, the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powders are preferably nitrided further under NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, as shown in the following generalized reaction: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>a&Circlesolid;BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z</subscript></highlight>&plus;b&Circlesolid;NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rarr;c&Circlesolid;BN </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> where a, b, and c are&gt;0; x, y, and z are&gE;0; and combustion products, for example CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and CO, may result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the preferred method, the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powders are collected from the tube furnace and placed in a second furnace (or the powder is not collected and the powder entrained on a gas stream is simply vented to the second furnace), or are subjected to an additional run in the original furnace. (See Example 1, infra.) Additional carbon can be added to assist with the O replacement via carbothermal reduction, if desired. This carbon addition may be accomplished, for example, by addition of higher R value (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B compounds as the precursor, addition of alkane, or arene compounds in the aerosol feed stream, or by addition of carbon powder to the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The nitriding conditions of this method may be varied in order to obtain particles that have morphologies that include but are not limited to smooth spherical particles that have a turbostratic structure, &ldquo;textured&rdquo; or bladed surface roughened spherical particles (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, TEM of BN Powder Formed in Second Stage at 1600&deg; C.), &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; spherical particles having crystalline whisker growth on the primary particle surfaces, &ldquo;bladed&rdquo; spherical morphology particles where the blades are highly ordered h-BN or fully platelet morphology particles that have the h-BN crystal structure. Variations in aerosol precursor, aerosol generation, aerosol processing, and reactor conditions (Stage I) and subsequent powder nitridation (Stage II) allow for the formation of alternative products in addition to the dense spherical particles described above. For example, BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powders produced at lower temperatures and/or with lower relative amounts of nitriding gas, NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and/or lower residence times have higher concentrations of oxygen (35-20%). These powders tend to form melts at modest temperatures between approximately 500&deg; C. to approximately 1200&deg; C. that can be processed in Stage II nitridation to form powder agglomerates, coated substrates or fiber/whisker materials. (See Examples 2, 3, 4, infra.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the nitridation conditions may also be varied in order to affect final powder density, surface area and microporosity. The amount of carbon in the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>can be conveniently varied by changing R in (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B as well as nitridation conditions in Stage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The resulting nano-dispensed carbon can be nitrided with ammonia (Stage II) providing microporous or nanoporous powder particles with variable surface areas (e.g., 20-500 m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/g) and porosities. (See Example 5, infra.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Further, valuable thin films of BN may be produced by grinding the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>particles, spreading them over an oxide substrate (or alternatively, the particles may be collected directly on a substrate) and reacting and melting them into a BN film. (See Example 3, infra.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In addition to the preferred method described supra, in alternate embodiments, the (RO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B reagents may be dissolved in liquid NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>solution and this solution used to form an aerosol (although such a process uses far greater amounts of ammonia). (Lindquist, DA et al. Boron Nitride Powders Formed by Aerosol Decomposition of Poly(borazinylamine) Solutions. <highlight><italic>J. Am. Ceram. Soc. </italic></highlight>74 (12 3126-28, 1991.) Using a dissolved precursor (in ammonia) may help avoid possible agglomeration of sub-micron particles when the precursor is introduced into a hot reactor. Such agglomerations may interfere with formation of the BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>structure. Similarly, the adduct (MeO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B.NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>may be useful to use as a precursor, as well as azeotropic mixtures of alkylborates and alcohols, most preferably, an azeotrope of trimethylborate and methanol. It is understood that while most commercially available azeotropic mixtures comprise a &ldquo;parent&rdquo; group, in this case an alkyl group, wherein the alkyl group of the alcohol and other member of the azeotrope comprise the same parent group (e.g., MeOH and (MeO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B), it is possible to utilize azeotropes having mixtures wherein the parent group may not &ldquo;match&rdquo; the corresponding portion of the other member (e.g., (EtO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B and (MeOH). Further, azeotropic mixtures may comprise multiple members, for example, in this case, MeOH, EtOH, and MeO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B. All these potential azeotropes are within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Additionally, alternate embodiments of the present invention will include using polyborates, such as boroxines, specifically trimethoxyboroxine, may be introduced to the reactor tube by use of liquid ammonia aerosol for use as the organoboron precursor. For purposes of the present invention, polyborates are defined to be any dealkoxylated or dehydrated boric anhydride precursor in the series from boron alkoxide or boric acid to boric anhydride (i.e., B(OR<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) . . . (ROBO)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>. . . (ROBO)<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>. . . B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Twenty five grams of (MeO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B was added to the aerosol generation chamber shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The chamber was then placed over the transducer in a Holmes humidifier base unit. The unit was turned on and its transducer causes ultrasonic agitation of the diaphragm at the base of the aerosol chamber. The resulting agitation of the liquid (MeO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B generated an aerosol mist of (MeO)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>B. Some of this mist was swept into the horizontal furnace tube by a stream of N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>gas (1 L/min) where it was mixed with NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>vapor (3 L/min), added separately. The aerosol vapor (&tilde;1.25 g/min) was carried through the reactor tube and held at a temperature of 1400&deg; C. The resulting BN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>y</subscript></highlight>C<highlight><subscript>z </subscript></highlight>powder (&tilde;0.3 g/min) was collected over a <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> minute interval on an impact filter on the exit end of the reactor.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Synthetic routes to functionalized polysiloxanes often suffer from complex methodologies, low yields, side reactions (e.g. involving rearrangements and/or degradation), or minimal characterization of the product(s). It generally known to synthesize alkoxysilanes under mild and neutral reaction conditions using metal-catalyzed oxidation reactions of monomeric hydrosilanes. The reported methods can suffer from the disadvantage of the non-selective modification of Si&mdash;H bonds, which leads to susceptibility of the Si&mdash;H bonds toward side reactions including dehydrocoupling, rearrangement and/or backbone degradation reactions. The formation of mixtures of &agr; and &bgr;-isomers, insoluble materials and rearrangement products are common drawbacks of reported methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a method of preparing a poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) using a relatively simple method under relatively mild reaction conditions. It would also be advantageous to provide a method of preparing a poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) that allowed for the selective alcoholysis of Si&mdash;H bonds without significant degradation of the siloxane backbone. It would also be advantageous to provide a method of preparing a poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) that allowed for monitoring of the reaction progress (e.g. by NMR). It would also be advantageous to provide a poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) product in a relatively high yield. It would be desirable to provide a method of preparing a poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) having one or more of these or other advantageous features. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of preparing aminofunctional polysiloxanes. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of preparing aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxanes. The method includes reacting a polyhydrosiloxane with an alcohol reactant including an aminoalcohol to form the aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane. The reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a catalyst, e.g., a dehydrogenative coupling catalyst which includes a rhodium compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present application also provides a coating composition which includes an aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane. The coating composition is particularly suitable as an adhesive or primer for coupling a topcoat to a substrate. The aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane may serve as the primary resin in the coating composition or in other embodiments, an aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane may act as a crosslinking agent and/or curing accelerator, e.g., in epoxy-based coating compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane compound can be a linear and/or cyclic alkoxy polysiloxane. As used herein, the term &ldquo;aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane compound&rdquo; refers to an alkoxy substituted polysiloxane compound which includes one or more aminofunctional alkoxy groups. For the purposes of this application, the term aminofunctional alkoxy group refers to groups which include at least one basic nitrogen atom and encompasses groups resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl hydrogen atom from an amino functional alkanol (e.g., &mdash;O&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;O&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), an amino functional cycloalkanol, and/or an amino functional hydroxy-substituted aryl compound (e.g., &mdash;O&mdash;C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&mdash;O&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>). As employed herein, the term &ldquo;aryl&rdquo; refers to both hydrocarbon aromatic groups and heteroatom-containing aromatic groups. For example, the aminofunctional alkoxy group may be an aminofunctional pyridyloxy group (i.e., a group resulting from the removal of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom from an aminofunctional hydroxypyridine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Amino groups are organic functional groups which contain a basic nitrogen atom. Examples of amino groups include aliphatic amino groups, such as mono-, di- and trialkylamino groups; cycloaliphatic amino groups, such a piperidinyl and piperazinyl groups; aromatic amino groups (i.e, where the basic nitrogen atom is part of an aromatic ring), such as pyridyl groups, pyrimidyl groups and pyrazinyl groups; and amino-substituted aromatic groups (i.e., where the basic nitrogen atom is directly bonded to an aromatic group), such as aminophenyl groups (e.g., &mdash;NH&mdash;C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and &mdash;C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&mdash;NR<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and aminopyridyl groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As employed herein, the term &ldquo;alkoxy group&rdquo; encompasses functional groups which include an alkyl-OH, cycloalkyl-OH or aryl-OH functional group whether or not the overall group includes an amino functional group, i.e., an aminofunctional alkoxy groups constitute one type of alkoxy group but not all alkoxy groups necessarily include a basic nitrogen atom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in formula (I) below, the siloxane subunits may not all contain an aminofunctional alkoxy group. Typically, at least a majority and, in many instances, all of the siloxane subunits of the polymer include an aminofunctional alkoxy group. Polysiloxanes where not all of the siloxane subunits of the include the same substituents polymer (with the exception of the terminal subunits) are referred to herein as &ldquo;polysiloxane copolymers.&rdquo; As used herein, such &ldquo;copolymers&rdquo; can have two or more different siloxane subunits. Polysiloxane copolymers can be formed by reacting a mixture of two alcohols, e.g., a mixture of 2-aminoethanol and ethanol, with a polyhydrosiloxane. Generally, the different siloxane subunits are randomly distributed in a polysiloxane copolymer (a &ldquo;random copolymer&rdquo;). However, by using appropriate synthetic methods known to those of skill in the art, polysiloxane copolymers in which the different siloxane subunits are present in &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; of two or more identical adjacent subunits can also be produced (&ldquo;block copolymers&rdquo;). The present polysiloxane copolymers typically have a ratio of siloxane subunits containing an aminofunctional alkoxy group to subunits which do not include an aminofunctional alkoxy group of about 20:1 to 1:20. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane compound can be formed by reacting a linear or cyclic polyhydrosiloxane and an alcohol reactant which includes an aminoalcohol (i.e. an amino functional compound which includes an alkyl-OH, cycloalkyl-OH or aryl-OH functional group) in the presence of a metal catalyst. The reaction of the polyhydrosiloxane and the aminoalcohol is typically carried out in the presence of a dehydrogenative coupling catalyst, such as those catalysts known to be useful for the dehydrogenative coupling of silanes. Suitable dehydrogenative coupling catalysts include catalysts which have been employed in metal catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of silanes and alcohols, such as those including Cr, Cu, Ir, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ti and Zn species. The dehydrogenative coupling catalysts may be a mixed metal catalyst that includes more than one metal species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As used in this disclosure, the term &ldquo;aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane&rdquo; refers to a alkoxy polysiloxane compound which includes one or more aminofunctional alkoxy groups. For the purposes of this application, the term &ldquo;polyaminofunctional alkoxy group&rdquo; refers to groups which include two or more amino groups and encompasses groups resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl hydrogen atom from a polyamino functional alkanol (e.g., &mdash;O&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NH&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), a polyamino functional cycloalkanol, a polyamino functional hydroxy-substituted aryl compounds (e.g., &mdash;O&mdash;C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NHCH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The method of preparing the aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane compound provides for the selective alcoholysis of Si&mdash;H bonds with aminoalcohol compounds, without significant degradation of the siloxane backbone or aminolysis of the Si&mdash;H bonds (i.e., dehydrogenative coupling of the hydrosilane occurs relatively exclusively with the hydroxyl moiety of the aminoalcohol). Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, it is believed that the formation of the aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane is accomplished by the dehydrogenative alcoholysis coupling between the selectively activated Si&mdash;H bond of the polyhydrosiloxane and the aminoalcohol. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The formation of the aminofunctional alkoxy polysiloxane can be derived from a &ldquo;linear&rdquo; polyhydrosiloxane or a &ldquo;cyclic&rdquo; polyhydrosiloxane. An exemplary reaction for the formation of a linear poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) from a linear polyhydrosiloxane is shown in the following scheme:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In general, the reaction may be conducted by introducing relatively equimolar amounts of the polyhydrosiloxane and the aminoalcohol (and the catalyst and the optional solvent) into a reaction vessel, and mixing or stirring the components. The reaction between the polyhydrosiloxane and the aminoalcohol is commonly carried out under relatively anhydrous and deoxygenated conditions. This may be conveniently achieved by degassing the reaction mixture and carrying the reaction out under an inert gas atmosphere (e.g. under a dry nitrogen or argon atmosphere). The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of about 0-200&deg; C. The use of reaction temperatures of less than about 100&deg; C., suitably 60-90&deg; C., is quite common. The reaction mixture may initially become yellow in color and emit gas (presumably H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), and may later became red/orange as the gas emission subsides. The reaction may be conducted for about 1-48 hours, suitably 1-30 hours, suitably 2-12 hours. NMR and IR analysis of the reaction mixture may establish the point at which relatively complete reaction of the Si&mdash;H functionalities are achieved. (The reaction progress could be monitored by the residual Si&mdash;H and O&mdash;H stretches that fall in a convenient window of the IR spectrum, and incorporation ratios of the alcohol can also be determined by integration of the NMR signals assigned to specific components.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Purification of the product may be achieved by passing the polyalkoxysiloxane product through neutral silica gel. In some instances, it may be advantageous to place a layer of anhydrous magnesium sulfate on top of a silica gel plug used to purify the reaction product. In another embodiment, the catalyst may be precipitated, (e.g., by allowing a benzene solution of the product to stand at ambient temperature for about 24-48 hours) and then removed by filtration. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Exemplary polyhydrosiloxanes which can be used as starting materials in the present method include polyhydrosiloxane (linear and/or cyclic) with one or two Si&mdash;H bonds in each siloxane subunit. The polyhydrosiloxane may be an alkyl, aryl and/or aralkyl substituted polysiloxane. Particularly suitable compounds are polyalkylhydrosiloxanes substituted with lower alkyl groups (i.e. C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>10 </subscript></highlight>alkyl groups), such as methyl and/or ethyl groups. Other suitable polyhydrosiloxanes may be substituted with alkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl and/or benzyl groups. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The alcohol reactant employed in the present method includes an aminoalcohol. Depending on the desired product, the alcohol reactant may only include aminoalcohol or may be a mixture of aminoalcohol and an alcohol compound lacking an amino functional group. For example, the alcohol reactant may be a mixture of 3-aminopropanol and ethanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The aminoalcohol includes at least one amino group, which is an organic functional group including a basic nitrogen atom. The amino group may be a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group. Examples of suitable amino groups include aliphatic amino groups (e.g. mono-, di- and trialkyl amino groups), cycloaliphatic amino groups (e.g. piperidinyl and piperazinyl groups), heterocyclic amino groups (e.g. pyridyl groups, pyrimidyl groups and pyrazinyl groups), and aromatic amino groups (e.g. anilino groups and aminophenyl groups). As used in this disclosure, the term &ldquo;aminoalcohol&rdquo; includes amino functional hydroxy substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl and aryl compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The aminoalcohol is suitably an aminofunctional alkoxy alcohol, which provides an aminofunctional alkoxy group to the poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane). Specific examples of suitable aminoalcohols include 3-amino-1-propanol, 1,3-(N,N-dimethylamino)-2-propanol, 2,5-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol, 3-(2-pyridyl)-1-propanol, 3-(4-pyridyl)-1-propanol, 4-hydroxy-N-methylpiperidine, 4-aminophenol, and 9-phenanthrolinemethanol. The amino functional group may be &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; on the alkoxy group (i.e. not in the backbone chain of the alkoxy group) and/or present as part of the backbone chain of the alkoxy group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the alcohol may be a mixture of an aminoalcohol and plain alcohol (i.e., an alcohol compound lacking an amino functional group). Specific examples of the suitable mixture of the aminoalcohol and plain alcohol include a 50:50 mixture of HO&mdash;(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and ethanol (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>OH). Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, it is believed that using a mixture of the aminoalcohol and plain alcohol would result in a suitable poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) compound, and the number of amino groups present relative to the number of siloxane subunits would be less than typically achieved with only an aminoalcohol. According to a preferred embodiment, the alcohol is a primary alcohol. According to an alternative embodiment the alcohol may be relatively hindered (e.g. tert-butyl alcohol). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> IV. Catalyst </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The reaction of the polyhydrosiloxane and the alcohol reactant is typically carried out in the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst may be provided in an amount of less than about 5 mole %, suitably less than about 0.1 mole %, suitably less than about 0.01 mole %. The amount of catalyst employed can be determined by those of skill in the art and will be based on a variety of factors such as desired reaction time, type of metal species in the catalyst, the presence or absence of solvent in the reaction mixture, the particular reactants involved, the configuration of the reaction vessel and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The reaction of the polyhydrosiloxane and the aminoalcohol is typically carried out in the presence of a dehydrogenative coupling catalyst, such as those catalysts known to be useful for the dehydrogenative coupling of silanes. Suitable dehydrogenative coupling catalysts include catalysts which have been employed in metal catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of silanes and alcohols, such as those including Pd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Rh and/or Ru species. Other suitable dehydrogenative coupling catalysts may include Pt, Zn, Ir, Cr, and/or Ti species. The dehydrogenative coupling catalysts may be a mixed metal catalyst that includes more than one metal species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Particularly suitable catalysts include rhodium catalysts and, more desirably, catalysts which include rhodium(I) species, such as phosphine-containing rhodium(I) catalysts. Suitable examples of phosphine-containing rhodium(I) catalysts include trisphosphino rhodium(I) salts, such as RhCl(P(C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(known as &ldquo;Wilkinson&apos;s catalyst&rdquo;), RhCl(P(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>(CF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>n&equals;6&minus;8</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and RhCl(P(C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>11</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3. </subscript></highlight>Examples of additional suitable rhodium catalysts include the compounds shown in Table 1:

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Depending on the choice of starting materials, the reaction may be &ldquo;neat&rdquo; (i.e. without added solvent) or in the presence of a solvent. In cases where the starting poly(alkylhydrosiloxane) is somewhat viscous, it is typically advantageous to include a solvent in the reaction mixture. The solvent is desirably chosen so that it does not react with other components of the reaction mixture and, preferably, does not strongly interact with the catalyst (if one is present). Exemplary solvents include relatively inert solvents that are capable of solublizing the reactants, such as hydrocarbon solvents, halogenated hydrocarbon solvents, and ethers. Suitable solvents include, without limitation, aromatic solvents (e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like), hydrocarbon solvents (e.g. hexanes, heptanes, octanes, petroleum fractions), halogenated alkanes (e.g. CCl<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, chlorinated ethanes, and the like), ethers (e.g. dialkyl ethers, glymes, THF, and the like). </paragraph>

The poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) may be a homopolymer, a blend, or a stoichiometric copolymer according to alternative embodiments. VII. Utility </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) compounds can have a variety of uses. For example, such compounds may be useful as a component of a coating composition. Depending on the particular application, a poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) compound may be used by itself to form a coating or may be formulated with other components known to those of skill in the art to form the coating composition. For example, a poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) may act as a crosslinking agent and/or curing accelerator in a coating composition, e.g., in an epoxy-based coating composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) compound may be used as a &ldquo;primer&rdquo; component in a coating system (e.g. to adhere a topcoat to a substrate). The primer containing the poly ((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) and a topcoat (e.g. polyurethane may be applied to a substrate according to the following exemplary method. A substrate (e.g. aluminum 2024-T3) may be treated by cleaning its surface with a solvent (e.g. acetone). The primer may be applied to the substrate &ldquo;neat&rdquo; with an applicator such as a &ldquo;draw down&rdquo; bar. The primer may be dried at ambient temperature for about one day, and cured at about 45 C for about five hours. The topcoat may be applied to the primer with an applicator such as a &ldquo;draw down&rdquo; bar. The topcoat may be dried at ambient temperature for about one day, and subsequently cured at an elevated temperature (e.g. at about 45-50 C for a period of hours). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Other uses for the poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) compounds include applications in the production of adhesives, catalyst supports, ionically conductive materials, liquid crystals, crosslinking agents, conductive and electroluminescent polymers, electrochemical sensing devices, and nonlinear optical chromophores. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In Examples 1-6, a poly((aminofunctional alkoxy)-alkylsiloxane) was formed by reacting a poly(alkylhydrosiloxane) and an aminoalcohol in deuterobenzene in the presence of a Rh(I) catalyst (((C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>RhCl). Two methods were used to remove the spent catalyst. According to the first method (&ldquo;Method A&rdquo;), the reaction mixture was flushed through a 5 ml syringe having a &ldquo;Kimwipe&rdquo; plug at the bottom, followed by a 3 ml silica gel plug (i.e. neutral, dried under vacuum and subsequently saturated with either benzene or toluene). On the occasions that excess aminoalcohol was present in the product mixture, it was removed by flushing the product mixture through a silica-gel plug (1 in.&times;1 cm diameter, with toluene solvent) where the aminoalcohol could be isolated as a secondary eluent. According to the second method (&ldquo;Method B&rdquo;), the reaction mixture was allowed to sit for about two days at ambient temperature, after which the catalyst precipitated out of solution as a red solid. The supernate was then removed from the solid with a syringe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> For Examples 1-6, all operations were carried out under inert atmosphere (unless otherwise stated).

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In Examples 7-10, an aminofunctional alkoxy siloxane was formed by reacting a poly(methylhydro)siloxane (PMHS) with the corresponding amino alcohol in the presence of a rhodium catalyst. The reactions were monitored by multinuclear NMR. In a typical experiment, RhCl(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(0.04 mmol) was dissolved in benzene-d<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, (0.5 mL) in a NMR tube, followed by the addition of benzyl alcohol (0.216 mL, 2 mmol) and (0.120 mL, 2 mmol). This mixture was degassed by 3-4 freeze pump-thaw cycles and heated in an oil bath at 78 C, just below the refluxing temperature, under a constant flow of argon. During the course of the reaction, evolution of a gas (presumably H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> For Examples 7-10, all reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of argon. Air sensitive products and reagents were handled by standard &ldquo;Schlenk&rdquo; techniques. All solvents were dried and distilled from purple solutions of sodium/benzophenone or P<highlight><subscript>2O</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, and glassware was dried in an oven at 110-120&deg; C. prior to use.

Commercially available alcohols were used without any further purification, except benzyl alcohol and 2,5-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol, which were distilled prior to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <highlight><superscript>29</superscript></highlight>Si, <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C, <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR spectra were recorded on JEOL GSX270 and GSX400 spectrometers commercially available from JEOL USA, Inc. of Peabody, Mass. <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H and <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C chemical shifts were measured against Me<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Si using solvent resonances as standard locks. <highlight><superscript>29</superscript></highlight>Si chemical shifts were referenced to external Me<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Si in the same solvent. Molecular weight of the polymers was determined by a Waters gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), commercially available from Waters Corporation of Milford, Mass. with polystyrene as the standard and THF as the solvent. IR spectra were recorded on a Matheson Instruments 2020 Galaxy Series spectrometer (commercially available from Matheson Instruments) as KBr pellets or solutions in CaF<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>cells. Elemental analyses were carried out by Galbraith Laboratories Inc. of Knoxville, Tenn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The following method was used for EXAMPLES 7-10. In a &ldquo;Schlenk&rdquo; tube, RhCl(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(&tilde;36 mg, 0.04 mmol) was suspended in dry benzene (0.8 mL), followed by the addition of benzylalcohol (0.22 mL, 2 mmol) and PMHS (0.12 mL, 2 mmol). This mixture was degassed by 3-4 freeze pump-thaw cycles and heated in an oil bath at 78 C, under a constant flow of argon. The red color of the catalyst disappeared within about 15 minutes of heating and the reaction mixture turned yellow and homogeneous. During substantially the entire course of the reaction, evolution of H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was observed. After 24 hours, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and passed through a dry silica gel pad and eluted with pentane/benzene (20/80). For gram scale preparations (4-7 gm) of these polymers, longer reaction times (48-72 h) were employed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention is generally related to computer systems for representing processes. It is more particularly related to database systems for storing and utilizing computerized representations of processes to assist enterprise modeling, developing workflow software, process re-engineering, understanding and analysis of processes and relations between alternative processes. This application is related to U.K. patent application serial number 9303873.5, filed 25 Feb. 1993 which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Organizations continually strive for improvement in their processes. However, such improvement is dependent on the extent of understanding of successful processes, including possible alternative processes and their interrelationships. Because there is little systematic theoretical or empirical foundation to assist understanding of processes, the development of improved processes is hindered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Developing a systematic theoretical or empirical foundation for understanding processes involves developing a representation of processes, in combination with a method and system for viewing the representation, which enables one to compare alternative ways to perform a task, to compare a task to similar tasks and to judge which alternative processes are likely to be useful for accomplishing the task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Much work is available concerning representation of computer processes. Processes for computer systems are commonly represented using flow charts, data flow diagrams, state transition diagrams (which define finite state machines, push down machines, or even Turing machines), Petri nets, and specialization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A flow chart represents a process as a series of steps, with arrows between them, which represents an order in which the steps are to be performed. Some of the steps are decision points, so depending on the circumstances, different sets of steps might be performed. A data flow diagram is similar but represents how modules of a system are interconnected to perform the steps of a process but focuses on the ordering relationships imposed by the fact that data produced by some modules is used by other modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A state transition diagram represents a process in terms of the possible states of the system. The steps taken in the process are the transitions that move the system from one state to another. The most powerful representation which included a state transition diagram is a Turing machine, which can be used to describe any computer executing any computer program written in any computer programming language. A Petri net is similar to a finite state machine, but allows multiple states to be marked simultaneously. Transitions between states may be synchronized, since multiple states have to be marked at the same time for a particular transition to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Significant developments have also been made in computer representation of objects, such as object-oriented systems. These systems rely on the concept of specialization which involves classifying specific objects into generic, more abstract classes from which they can inherit properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> These representational paradigms for computer processes, although applicable to the representation of organizational processes lack the ability to model how processes are related and how processes may be dependent on each other in ways other than prerequisites or data flow type dependencies. More specifically, these paradigms have not been applied effectively in representing interrelationships of processes in a kind of computerized handbook which could be consulted to find a variety of alternative ways to perform particular processes, along with experience and guidelines about which alternatives work best in given situations. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A method and system for representing processes has been developed to provide a computerized handbook of processes. This handbook can be used for, among other things, teaching, process re-engineering, enterprise modelling, and software development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A computerized handbook of processes includes a memory in which representations of a plurality of processes are stored. A representation for a process includes indications of processes into which the process is decomposed. At least one of the plurality of processes is a specialization of another one of the plurality of processes, and the representation of the specialization is such that the specialization inherits characteristics from the other process. The handbook also includes a display system including a display. Specializations of a process are accessed from the memory and displayed on the display. A decomposition of a process is also accessed and displayed on the display. The accessing and displaying of decompositions and specializations are provided upon user selection.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be more completely understood through the following detailed description which should be read in conjunction with the attached drawing in which similar reference numbers indicate similar structures. All references cited herein are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A general explanation of some general concepts underlying the invention will first be provided. The terms &ldquo;activity&rdquo; and &ldquo;process&rdquo; are used interchangably throughout. In this description, examples are provided by reference to various organizational processes; however, this invention is not limited thereto and is applicable to computer processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A process representation has been developed that explicitly represents similarities and differences among a collection of related processes. In order to provide such a representation, notions of inheritance from the field of knowledge representation and concepts about managing dependencies from the field of coordination theory have been exploited. With this representation, a generic process can be represented and more specific processes are represented by simply indicating how they differ from the generic process. Processes are thus represented at many different levels of abstraction along with their relationships to other processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In the traditional notion of inheritance, as used in object-oriented programming and knowledge representation, objects are defined to create a hierarchical network with general categories at the top and increasingly specialized kinds of objects at lower levels. For example, &ldquo;Products&rdquo; might be specialized into categories like &ldquo;Goods&rdquo; and &ldquo;Services&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Goods&rdquo; might be specialized into categories like &ldquo;Automobiles&rdquo; and &ldquo;Furniture&rdquo;. At each of these levels, objects may &ldquo;inherit&rdquo; characteristics from higher levels, and add or change characteristics of their own. For instance, all &ldquo;Goods&rdquo; might have a &ldquo;Weight&rdquo; and &ldquo;Size&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Automobiles&rdquo; might also have a &ldquo;Miles per gallon&rdquo; characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In contrast to this traditional notion of inheritance, which is organized around a hierarchy of increasingly specialized objects, a hierarchy of increasingly specialized processes has been developed. This notion of process specialization is different from (but complementary to) the conventional notion of process decomposition. In general, decomposition indicates &ldquo;and&rdquo; relationships among the processes into which a more general process is decomposed. Specialization indicates &ldquo;or&rdquo; relationships among the specialized processes, because the notion of specialization implies that the specialized process is &ldquo;complete in itself&rdquo;, not just a part of the more general process. Thus, specialization is generally used to indicate alternative ways of performing an activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of how decomposition and specialization can work together using the representational scheme which has been developed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>graphically illustrate the different types of possible relationships between activities which are used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a representation of inheritance, where activity A shown in the shaded region <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is inherited by a specialization <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> from a more generic process <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in which the activity A <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> appeared in a more generic process <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrates the relationship where activity B <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> replaces activity A <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in a specialization <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, where activity A appeared in a more generic process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows a relationship where activity A <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> from a generic process <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is omitted in a specialization <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> as indicated by an &ldquo;x&rdquo; in a box <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shows a relationship of dependency, where activity A must precede activity B to perform a given process. This dependency may be indicated by an arrow <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>illustrates the relationship where activities B <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and C <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are decompositions of activity A. Decomposition may be shown by solid branching lines <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>shows the relationship where activities B and C are alternative specializations of A. Specialization may be shown by dashed lines with arrows <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. The graphical representations shown in these figures can be used to display these relationships on a computer display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the generic activity &ldquo;Sell product&rdquo; <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is decomposed into subactivities like &ldquo;Identify prospects&rdquo; <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;Inform prospects about product&rdquo; <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The generic activity is also specialized into more focused activities like &ldquo;Direct mail sales&rdquo; <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;Retail storefront sales&rdquo; <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. These specialized activities automatically inherit the subactivities and other characteristics of their &ldquo;parent&rdquo; process. In some cases, however, the specialized processes add to or change the characteristics they inherit. For instance, in direct mail selling the subactivities &ldquo;obtain order&rdquo; <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;deliver produce&rdquo; <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are inherited without modification. But &ldquo;identify prospects&rdquo; <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is replaced by the more specialized activity of &ldquo;obtain mailing lists&rdquo; <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and activity of the sales person talking to prospects (at <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) is omitted altogether. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Decomposition and alternative specialization can, of course, be applied to activities at any level. For instance, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows that &ldquo;Obtain mailing lists&rdquo; <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be further decomposed into selecting lists <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, ordering lists <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and receiving lists <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. &ldquo;Inform prospects about product&rdquo; <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be specialized into &ldquo;Advertising&rdquo; <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or &ldquo;Sales person talks to prospects&rdquo; <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An activity at any level can also be a specialization of one or more other activities. For instance, in retail storefront sales, &ldquo;clerk waits on customer&rdquo; is a specialization of both &ldquo;inform prospects&rdquo; and &ldquo;obtain order&rdquo;, since in many cases, a clerk both informs customers and also convinces them to buy. When an activity is a specialization of two or more other activities, it inherits the union of the subactivities and other characteristics of its parents. This kind of multiple inheritance is useful to represent many actual organizational processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Where there are multiple alternative specializations for an activity, it is useful to combine groups of alternative specializations into &ldquo;bundles&rdquo; of related alternatives. For instance as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, one bundle of specializations for &ldquo;Sell product&rdquo; <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is related to how the sale is made, or the channel <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>: direct mail <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, retail storefront <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, or a direct sales force <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Another bundle of specializations has to do with what is being sold or, the product <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>: shampoo <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, computers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, or cars <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Other bundles could concern the type of consumers, e.g., hotels, manufacturing companies, and so forth. Bundles are used in at least two ways, comparing alternatives and controlling inheritance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Alternatives are compared using a tradeoff matrix, which is appropriate only within a bundle of related alternatives. For example, comparing &ldquo;retail storefront sales&rdquo; to &ldquo;selling shampoo&rdquo; does not make much sense. A tradeoff matrix compares the different alternatives in terms of their ratings on various goals. This tradeoff matrix can also include detailed justifications for the various ratings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Some discussion of tradeoff matrices can be found in &ldquo;Sibyl: A Tool For Managing Group Decision Rationale&rdquo; in <highlight><italic>ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work </italic></highlight>(CSCW&apos; 90), Los Angeles, Calif., 1990, by J. Lee. In some tradeoff matrices, the comparisons are the result of systematic studies; and others, they may be simply rough guesses by knowledgeable managers or consultants, with appropriate indications of their preliminary nature. Of course, in some cases, there may not be enough information available to include any comparisons at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a sample tradeoff matrix <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> for a bundle containing two alternative specializations for the generic product development process, functional organization <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and project organization <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The tradeoff matrix in this bundle shows typical advantages and disadvantages of group and product development teams organized by by functional specialty or by project such as time to market <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, for which functional organization rates low as indicated at <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and project organization rates high as indicated at <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is also a suitable screen image for displaying a tradeoff matrix). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Alternatives in a bundle should also automatically inherit alternatives from the other bundles but not the other alternatives in their own bundle. For instance, it makes sense for someone selling shampoo to be automatically presented with alternatives for direct mail, retail storefront, and telemarketing, but it does not make much sense for this person to be automatically presented with alternatives of selling computers, newspapers, and consulting. Users who identify their interest as selling shampoo could also always move up to the more generic activity of &ldquo;Sell product&rdquo; <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to see other possible products. Thus it also follows that unrelated bundles (an further specialize each other. Thus the bundle &ldquo;Channel&rdquo; <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be a specialization of the activity of selling computers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It is also possible that a certain specialization, e.g. direct mail <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, as applied in such a context, may be different from the more general activity of direct mail selling <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Thus, contextual inheritance may be defined. This allows a user to view how the &ldquo;same&rdquo; activity is performed in different contexts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> This method of representing processes using a combination of decomposition and alternative specializations has a number of significant benefits over previous process representation techniques. First, it can be substantially reduce the amount of work necessary to represent a new process. By simply identifying a more general process that the new process is intended to specialize, most of the information about the new process can be automatically inherited and only the changes need to be explicitly entered. Second, changes made at a high level can be automatically inherited by more specialized processes, thus greatly simplifying the process of maintaining the process descriptions. Third, by explicitly representing alternative processes and their relative advantages and disadvantages, the task of selecting appropriate processes is facilitated. Fourth, by arranging the alternative processes in a specialization hierarchy, the process of finding, combining, and generating relevant alternatives is greatly enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, depending on their goals, users of the system can browse at various levels of abstraction, finding alternatives that are related according to the principles embodied in the specialization structure. For instance, merely collecting descriptions of how different companies sell consulting services would probably identify numerous examples of direct sales and perhaps mail advertising techniques. The specialization hierarchy described above, however, would quickly lead users who were interested in more radical alternatives to consider options like retail storefront selling, even if no cases of consulting firms using this method had been observed. Thus, the system helps users generate new alternatives by creating new specializations of alternatives at higher levels of abstraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Assuming that all processes can be decomposed into a set of activities (e.g., &ldquo;steps&rdquo;, &ldquo;tasks&rdquo;, or &ldquo;subprocesses&rdquo;), a process representation can be further enhanced by characterizing different kinds of dependencies between activities and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As an example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a table which shows how types of dependencies <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be associated with different types of coordination processes <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. For example, shared resource constraints <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> can be managed by a variety of coordination processes <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> such as &ldquo;first come/first serve&rdquo;, priority order, budgets, managerial decision, and market-like bidding. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. If three job shop workers need to use the same machine, for instance, they could use a simple &ldquo;first come/first serve&rdquo; mechanism. Alternatively, they could use a form of budgeting with each worker having pre-assigned time slots, or a manager could explicitly decide what to do whenever two workers wanted to use the machine at the same time. In some cases, they might even want to &ldquo;bid&rdquo; for use of the machine and the person willing to pay the most would get it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> suggests, some dependencies can be viewed as specializations of others. For instance, task assignment <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can be seen as a special case of allocating shared resources <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. In this case, the resource being allocated is the time of people who can do the tasks, implying that the coordination processes for allocating resources in general can be specialized to apply to task assignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In other cases, some dependencies can be seen as being composed of others. For instance, producer-consumer relationships <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are often composed of at least three other kinds of dependencies: prerequisite constraints <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (an item must be produced before it can be used), transfer constraints <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (an item must be transferred from the place it is produced to the place it is used), and usability constraints <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, (an item that is produced should be &ldquo;usable&rdquo; by the activity that uses it). Each of these different kinds of dependencies, in turn, has different processes, as listed in column <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, for managing it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> By identifying various types of dependencies possible between activities and the associated coordination processes for managing them, several representational benefits can be obtained in a computerized handbook, specifically conciseness and generativity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A more concise representation of processes is possible because, instead of explicitly listing all the coordination activities separately in each different process, it is merely indicated that the dependency between two activities is managed by an instance of a particular coordination process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows one very important kind of dependency between activities, prerequisite constraints. Note that no prerequisites are shown at the generic level of &ldquo;Sell product&rdquo; <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, suggesting that the generic activities can, in principle, be performed in any order. The specializations of &ldquo;Direct mail sales&rdquo; <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;Retail storefront sales&rdquo; <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, however, both include prerequisite constraints between activities. For instance, in direct mail sales <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, it is assumed that the order <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the payment <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> must both be received before the product is delivered <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, prerequisite dependencies can be managed, in part, by processes of notification <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and tracking <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> suggests further decompositions and specializations of these processes. As an example, a typical order entry system specializes both a notification process and a tracking process. When an order entry system prints a packing list of orders ready to be shipped, it notifies the packers that the prerequisites for shipping-have been fulfilled and it helps managers track the orders for which payments have been received but that have not yet been packed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> By developing generic process representations for each of the coordination processes listed the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and by extending <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> to include many more dependencies and coordination processes, it is possible to represent concisely much of the coordination activity that occurs in organizations as specializations of these generic processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> This process representation also helps generate new possibilities for coordination processes. That is, if there are several coordination processes for managing a given dependency, then they all can be generated automatically as possibilities for managing that dependency in any new process to be considered. Some of these possibilities may be new or non-obvious, and their generation requires no specific knowledge of the process other than the type of dependencies the process involves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows prerequisite relationships among the subactivities of obtaining mailing lists <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>: selecting <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, ordering <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and receiving <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> the lists. Based only upon the existence of these prerequisite relationships, the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> suggests that the designers of this process should consider how to track the status of various mailing lists that have been ordered. The table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also suggests alternatives for how to do this tracking, including various kinds of database systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Note that a system preferably generates only alternatives that are &ldquo;sensible&rdquo; according to the constraints reflected in the system, but it should not rule out alternatives that are inappropriate because of other factors. Instead, the process representations should be organized so that human users can quickly scan numerous alternatives, all of which have some relationship to the situation being considered, but many of which can be quickly eliminated. By systematically presenting related alternatives, the system will often surprise its users with possible, but non-obvious, alternatives they might not have considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Having now described some general concepts underlying the present invention, a specific embodiment will now be described. A computerized handbook of processes implementing the foregoing concepts should have the following functional specifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Concerning process representation and storage, a representation of processes/activities should permit a significant amount of information (text) to be associated with them. The representation should also have the ability to relate processes (e.g., by using links) in a hierarchical network with lower levels of processes inheriting characteristics of higher level processes. Single and multiple inheritance should be possible. Furthermore, the representation should have the ability to create dependencies between processes and associate these dependencies with coordination processes for managing them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> A suitable computerized handbook should also have adequate display functionality to allow various users to query the handbook and analyze and identify processes. For example, the system should have the ability to view/zoom into a decomposition and specializations of individual activities, for example in the form of a flowchart. It should also have the ability to view user-defined attributes, date modified. etc. It should also be able to navigate to any random process by various search criteria, such as process name. If a unique name is assigned to each process, one should also be able &apos;to view all specializations of a process, or to a specified depth. For example one could also view the decomposition of a process to a given depth, or conversely the parents of a process to a given height from which the process inherits its characteristics. Finally, one could also view where a process is used as a subtask. Other information, e.g., dependencies, may be retrieved implicitly via the above operations, or else via additional operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Editing functionality of the system is also important. A user should be able to add, modify, delete and reorganize processes including their attributes, specializations, decompositions, and dependencies. This editing should be based on user selected parameters, such as a parent of a given process. The system should also be able to propagate, using inheritance, all attributes of higher levels to the new process, to allow for selection of multiple parents, and thus multiple inheritance, to allow aggregate specialization of process, and to combine processes, modify dependencies, reassign processes for managing dependencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Finally, a system should have evaluation and interpretation functionality. That is, it should have the ability to view bundles of alternative activities associated with process and associated comparison of advantages and disadvantages which might be represented, for example, by tradeoff matrices or decision trees. It may also be beneficial to develop heuristics/algorithms for interpreting and evaluating processes or functional flow and for creating work flows/simulation from process decompositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a general block diagram of a system which is suitable for implementing the present invention according to the above-described functionality. A computer system <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> includes a processor <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> and a memory <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> interconnected on a bus <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> to which input devices <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> and output devices <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be connected. Suitable input devices include a keyboard, trackball, mouse, etc. A suitable output is either a printer or a video display. A suitable computer system is a personal computer including an i286 or later processor available from Intel, such as an IBM PC/AT computer or compatible, with 640 KB of random access memory or higher, 2 megabytes or more of hard disk space, a disk operating system (DOS) such as MS-DOS Version 3.0 or higher and Microsoft Windows Version 3.0 or higher. It should be understood that this system is meant to be merely illustrative, and not limiting. Many other computer systems may be used to implement the present invention. A program implementing this invention can be written using the KAL application language, part of the KAPPA-PC Application Development System, available from Intellicorp, Inc. of Mountainview, Calif. The following description is based on such an implementation. This application was selected because of its ability to allow a user or program to dynamically add slots in an object and not merely alter values of those slots. Most compiled object-oriented languages available at this time do not have such capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Other commercially-available tools may also be suitable to implement this system. For example, Notes, available from Lotus Corporation, may also be used. It has two advantages: a shared database and the automatic entry of process data gathered using Notes forms. One obstacle is the absence of a straightforward way to effect automatic inheritance. Classes may be modelled by Notes documents, and inheritance may be modelled by the response mechanism, thus supporting only single inheritance. Also, the Notes outline view would be the only means of browsing the handbook, and thus it would not clearly show dependencies, bundles, and other associations. A network view of documents and their links is preferable. Other tools may also be integrated into the on-line process handbook to enhance the handbook with the functionality and features such tools, without requiring the effort to implement these features. It is possible to store static representations of processes in a standard form which could be read by other applications, such as CASE tools, flowcharting systems, simulators, etc. A representation based on KIF (Knowledge Interchange Format) developed by the Interlingua Working Group under the U.S. DARPA Knowledge Sharing Initiative may be suitable for this purpose. These applications could also be used to browse the process handbook, but not edit it. For example, Excelerator, available from Intersolv, is an OS/2.21 CASE product which can also support the proposed representation model, as well as provide a sophisticated user interface that includes flowchart views, data flow views, state machine views, and the like. The interface of this product is customizable using the Excelerator Customizer, which uses SmallTalk as a scripting language. This product would be primarily suitable for a user interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In an object oriented system like KAL, a process can be represented by a number of objects. A first kind of object is called an activity. Each process is defined by a separate activity class. All activity classes have a similar structure such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. That is, each activity object <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> has a slot for a name <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, such as &ldquo;sell product&rdquo;. It also includes a slot for a reference to a subactivity object which indicates the subactivities <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> which define the decomposition of the process. The subactivity object will be described in more detail below. It also includes a slot has a reference to an attribute object which indicates the attributes <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> of the process. Attribute objects will also be discussed in more detail below. A reference to a link list object <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> is also provided, which is a list of slots each referring to a link (to be described below) which represents a dependency present in the decomposition of the activity. Two other slots are also provided in each activity object <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> which are binary indicators. The first slot for bundles <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> indicates whether the activity is a bundling object. A context slot <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> contains a reference to an activity for which contextual specialization are defined. The use of these last two slots will be described in more detail below. This implementation of bundles and contexts is merely illustrative. There are many possible ways to implement these features. Each activity also has a &ldquo;where used&rdquo; slot <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> which indicates the activities of which it is a subactivity. When a subactivity is added in a decomposition of another activity, a reference to that decomposition parent activity is placed in the &ldquo;where used&rdquo; slot of the subactivity. When a subactivity is removed from a decomposition of another activity, the reference to the other activity is removed from the &ldquo;where used&rdquo; slot of the subactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates the subactivity object <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> such as would be referred to by slot <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> of an activity <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. A subactivity object <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> contains slots <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, each referring to an activity object which is a subactivity of the parent activity. Thus, the activities referred to in slots <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> define the decomposition of the parent activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates the structure of the link list object type <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. A link list object <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> contains a list of slots, each referring to a link object <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> which represents a dependency link present in the decomposition of the parent activity. Link objects will be described in more detail now in connection with the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A link object <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> includes a paths slot <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is an ordered list of references to path objects (defined below). The semantics of the ordering are dependent on the dependency type, e.g., the ordering defines direction for a prerequisite type of dependency. Another slot is defined in a link which refers to the dependency type <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. This reference is to another object called a dependency object which will be described in more detail below in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A path object <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> will now be described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. A path object <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> has one slot <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> which is an ordered list of references to activities which make up the path from the activity, up the decomposition to the closest common ancestor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The dependency object <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> will now be described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. This type of object includes a slot indicating the name <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the kind of dependency. A reference to an activity subclass corresponding to the most generic managing process for this dependency type is referred to in slot <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Finally, a slot <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> refers to the number of members which this dependency type manages. Most prerequisite types of coordination processes have only two members, whereas producer-consumer relationships can involve an undefined number of members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> An attribute object, not shown in any drawing, is a list of slots, each representing a user defined attribute of an activity. Thus, a user, that is one who is inputting data into the process handbook, can define attributes of different activities. These attributes are used in conjunction with the tradeoff matrices. They may also provide text descriptions of various activities. It is through use of these attribute objects that large amounts of text can be stored in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> describes in more detail the overall interconnection of these object classes and how specific processes are represented with object classes. In general, there are the main classes of objects of activities <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, subactivities <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>, attributes <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, link lists <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, links <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, paths <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, and dependencies <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. These most generic classes are the most generic objects of which all other processes become subclasses, which subclasses inherit all slots and their values from parent classes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the drawing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> class-subclass relationship is indicated by a narrow line <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> such as shown in the legend <highlight><bold>217</bold></highlight>. A direct class-subclass relationship is indicated by a darker line <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, for example as shown at <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. A narrow line <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> indicates that an object, such as activity <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> contains a reference to another object, such as a link list <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A specific process is thus a subclass of an activity <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the activity &ldquo;sell product,&rdquo; given an identifier &ldquo;ACT1234&rdquo; shown at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, thus inherits all the characteristics of a generic activity <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, and refers to subclasses of the objects referred to by the generic activity. <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> This object <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, named &ldquo;sell product&rdquo;, contains a reference to subactivity objects <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, attribute objects <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and link list objects <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. Each of the specific objects <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> inherit the slots and values from their parent objects which are respectively subactivities <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>, attributes <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, and link lists <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. A bundle <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> is a direct subclass of the activity for which the bundle is defined. Thus, it inherits all of the slots and values of the main activity <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, but the name <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and the bundle <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> slots have changed values to indicate that this is a bundle and defines, via the name <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, what the bundle indicates. Accordingly, the bundle <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> also has references to the same subactivity attribute and link list objects which are referred to by its parent object. The arrows indicating these relationships are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Specializations of an activity are therefore subclasses of a more generic activity. If specializations are bundled together, they are direct subclasses of an appropriate bundle subclass of the more generic activity. In particular, selling by mail and retail sale activities, indicated at <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> are direct subclasses of the bundle <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> which is also a direct subclass of selling a product <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The subactivities of each of these specializations are also subclasses of the subactivity object defined for the more generic activity, as indicated at <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The activities <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> also have specialized attributes and link lists <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, respectively, which are subclasses of the attribute and link lists <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, respectively, of the more generic activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Links <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>, subclasses of the general link object <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are referred to by a more specific link list object <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a dependency type <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> as representing a prerequisite type of dependency, is a subclass of a generic dependency <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and is referred to by link <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Contexts are similar to bundles in the object hierarchy, although they are not illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. A context is a special kind of bundle which indicates that all specializations under the context are different variations of the parent activity as defined in different contexts. The underlining specializations, and their context field, indicate the name of the context in which they are used. For example, if the subactivity of &ldquo;inform prospects about product&rdquo; <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> were different for the &ldquo;direct mail sales&rdquo; activity, a bundle given the name of context would be created for the &ldquo;inform prospects about product&rdquo; activity <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The activity of informing prospects about the product in the context of direct mail sales <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> would then be a specialization of that bundle. The context slot in that specialization would then have the name &ldquo;direct mail sales&rdquo;. The usefulness of this construct will be described in more detail below in connection with the use and input of the handled data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Thus, in this representation of a process, more generic processes are represented by more abstract classes of objects and specializations are subclasses; decompositions are references to other activities. The result is that the object hierarchy defined by the system defines the specialization hierarchy of the processes in the process handbook. If a module dependency diagram were to be developed for the objects in this object hierarchy, it would indicate where each activity is used in decompositions of other activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the foregoing description is not intended to limit the invention to object-oriented systems. Other systems may be used, and the object structures discussed above suggest that information which is tracked and used in a process handbook. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Browsing using the process handbook will now be described in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Many object-oriented systems provide object browsers which allow a user to view the object hierarchy. By using such a browser, and because the specialization hierarchy of processes is defined by the object hierarchy, many specializations of processes can be shown merely by using this object browser. A sample display is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The capability of the object browser is described in more detail in the <highlight><italic>User&apos;s Guide</italic></highlight>, the <highlight><italic>Reference Manual</italic></highlight>, and the <highlight><italic>Advanced Topics </italic></highlight>manuals that come with the Kappa PC product. In particular, reference is made to these manuals for Version 2.0 of the product, as printed in November of 1992. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the generic process &ldquo;business function&rdquo; <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is specialized into, in this example, six other processes indicated at <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. Each of these processes is further specialized into processes indicated in the column at <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. Similarly, processes indicated at <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> are further specializations of those shown at <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. Viewing the top processes in each of these columns, we see that selling by mail is a specialization within a bundle called distribution channel which is in turn a specialization of selling a product which is a specialization of a business function. Each of these representations of a process is a specific object class in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Typically, an object browser provides much viewing functionality, including the ability to focus on a specific object as a root object, ignoring all other objects in the hierarchy. Also, the depth of the hierarchy which is viewed can also be controlled. Many of these capabilities are programmable options which can be controlled by appropriate programming in accordance with the instructions provided in the manuals for Kappa-PC. The generation of menus, icons and other appropriate input forms is well within the level of ordinary skill in this art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> With the object browser it is also possible to select a given activity, and to display the module dependency diagram of the activity. That is, an indication of a process can be displayed and its list of subactivities can be traversed so as to identify all of the activities making up its decomposition. Such a display for selling a product has already been shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The process of displaying this module dependency diagram for a selected activity involves identifying the subactivity object associated with the activity, obtaining the names of each of the activities listed in the subactivity object and generating the appropriate display. The depth of the decomposition displayed is preferably controlled by the user. For example, a user may select to view a decomposition to the depth of a second level. On the other hand, the system could be designed to display only one level at a time for each individual activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It is also possible, at the user&apos;s option, to have dependency links displayed. The references in the link list to links and paths are traversed to identify, out of the displayed activities, which activities have dependencies. Furthermore, some information concerning the coordination activity associated with each link can also be displayed such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> in a window <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. The name of the dependency type can be shown such as at <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, along with a brief description of the dependency at <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>. An indication of the managing process for the activity can be provided at <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>. One could then view the variety of specializations of that generic managing process if the user so desired, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> at window <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The capability for the user to view the attributes of an activity should also be provided. This could be done by a menu function, wherein, in response to a menu selection, the attributes for the selected activity object are retrieved and their names and values are displayed, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> at window <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>. Attribute names can be shown in column <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight> and their corresponding values can be shown in column <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. A field can also be provided at <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> for various comments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> These attributes may also be viewed when viewing a bundle of specializations. For example, when a user identifies a bundle from the object hierarchy, the user can be permitted to view the tradeoff matrix. Such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> at window <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. In this window, the name of each activity in the bundle can be identified in column <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> along with a column for each of a selected subset of attributes such as shown at <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight>. The values of the attributes for each activity are then displayed in their appropriate columns, thus enabling one to compare the different activities in the bundle. It is also possible to provide a comment, such as shown at <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, which provides some analysis of the tradeoff matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Having now described the various output capabilities for this system, processes for inputting data will now be described. There are primarily the activities of creating, deleting, changing, and moving activities. These may involve renaming activities, adding bundles and specializations. The ability to add, change, move or delete also applies to subactivities, dependencies and attributes. A variety of user interfaces may be provided for performing these functions. There is no specifically preferred way to allow input of the data except that it is preferable to make the input as intuitive as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Because each activity, and the other objects associated with it are all object classes, changing them involves operations of adding slots, creating classes and changing values within slots. For example, creating subactivities, links, attributes and so on simply involves the step of creating an object subclass of the generic class. Once created, these objects can be modified. In the editing process, whenever a modification affects an-activity, it should be determined whether that activity is used in more than one other activity. That is, for example, if one were to change the activity of direct mail sales, it should first be determined whether direct mail sales occurs in the decomposition of activities other than selling a product. If it does appear in other decompositions, a process as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> should be followed. The detection of multiple use of an activity (performed by examining the whereused slot of the activity) can be treated as an interrupt which causes a query <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to the user to occur which request the user to indicate whether the change should be global or merely local. If the change should be global, processing continues on the changes to the activity and all of these changes then occur in all of the decompositions in which this activity appears. If the user requests that the change be merely local, i.e., only in the context of the current decomposition being viewed, a context bundle is created in step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, as a specialization of the original activity which is being modified. A further specialization in the context bundle is then created in step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The activity to which a modification is to be made is substituted with this new specialization in step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. That is, modifications to the activity selected by the user are actually made to the new specialization in the context bundle in step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Operations on activities will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Subclasses are also created for the objects referred to by the original activity. The newly created specialized activity is then modified to refer to these newly created other subclasses. An exception applies for creating bundles, where only a subclass of the original parent activity is created. The bundle activity still refers to and inherits all of the slots and values of the parent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Deleting an activity from the specialization hierarchy prompts the user in step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> as to whether the user would like to attach the children or specializations of the activity to the activity&apos;s parent, or more generic activity, or whether all of the specializations or children should be deleted as well. If the children are to be attached, the class hierarchy is moved to be specializations of the parent of the deleted activity, in step <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, using a computer instruction available in the Kappa-PC application language. Otherwise, all of the children are deleted in step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, also using standard commands that are available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Moving specializations around in the specialization hierarchy is similar to step <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. This capability allows one to redefine how activities are specializations of other activities once activities are entered into the process handbook. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Renaming an activity or any other object used in this system involves changing the value of the slot for the name for that object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Because Kappa-PC does not support multiple inheritance, this capability is provided by additional structures transparent to the user. If an activity has multiple parents, two specialized activities are created, each as a direct subclass of each of the parents. During display of a decomposition of this specialization, the activity is computed as the union of the decompositions of all siblings. In such an embodiment, each activity has a slot called &ldquo;siblings&rdquo; which is a list of all of the direct subclasses of each of the parents that were mentioned above. When a decomposition including one of the generated subclasses is displayed, the union of the two related subclasses is generated and displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Operations on subactivities will now be described. These operations involve adding and deleting and modifying and moving. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a flowchart describing how subactivities are added to an activity. Of course, because an additional subactivity changes the activity of which it is part, the process described above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> should initially be performed before the subactivity is added. After that process is performed, a slot is added to the subactivity object <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> of the activity to which a subactivity is to be added. The activity object for the subactivity is then created in step <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> and a reference to it is placed in the newly created slot in the subactivity object, in step <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Deleting, modifying, and moving a subactivity involve related operations. It should be first pointed out that each slot for an object has some other properties besides its value, in particular, status values. These status values can be such that a slot can be marked as deleted or modified, in comparison to its parent object. Also, each slot can be assigned a rank for display purposes. Thus, whenever a slot for an object is deleted or modified with reference to its parent, the status information for that slot is marked as either deleted or modified. Similarly, moving a slot involves changing the respective ranks of the slots. The ranks are used to control the display. The status information is used for deleting and modifying to control the display as well. Thus, it can be indicated where activities in a decomposition of a specialization differ from the decomposition of the specializations parent. For example, the rank values are used to control the order of appearance, for example, from left to right, of the indications of the decompositions in the display, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The addition of links to a decomposition will now be described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. Given two activities the first step of adding a dependency between two activities in a decomposition is a step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of finding the common ancestor in the decomposition of these objects. A slot is then added to the link list of the ancestor activity in step <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. A link object is then created with reference to a dependency type in step <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. This step involves generating a path for each of the activities to the common ancestor and identifying, or requesting the user for, an appropriate dependency type. These created objects are then referenced in the link list in the slot which was added in step <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> To be most useful, a computerized handbook such as described herein should be populated with a substantial number of process descriptions, which are-collected in a way that enforces consistency among comparisons of processes in a wide variety of contexts. Thus, suggestions for data collection are the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Descriptions should be both consistent with the vocabulary native to a given problem but also common among a variety of situations. As new situations are confronted new kinds of activities will be encountered that are qualitatively different from those described with the existing vocabulary. To accommodate these activities, new categories of activities are created, with the result that the vocabulary grows. As the vocabulary grows the proliferation of terminology should not be allowed to obscure underlying similarities between steps in processes that take place in different contexts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The vocabulary should also provide levels of abstraction and granularity at which meaningful and useful descriptions can be formulated. In principle, processes could be translated into primitive elements at an extremely fine-grained level. However, previous attempts to codify an appropriate set of primitives have not fared especially well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Given an appropriately developed handbook including suitable representations of another of processes, an example of how this handbook might be used will now be provided. Assume there is a consultant to a general manager of a new division of a large computer hardware vendor. This vendor has traditionally used a highly skilled direct sales force, but the mission of the new division is to sell personal computers and software by direct mail. A small publishing group has existed in this company for years, distributing documentation and other technical reference material by mail order. This publishing group will also be incorporated into the new division. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The job of the consultant is to help the new manager decide how to staff and structure this new division. Numerous questions may arise such as: should the processes already in use in the mail order publishing group be simply adopted and scaled up&quest; What new problems might arise when these processes are scaled to sales volumes 50 to 100 times what they were&quest; Are there other processes that might be better suited for the volumes, products, and customers targeted&quest; What is the &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; among mail order vendors in other industries&quest; Can advanced information technology be exploited to organized a highly efficient mail order service&quest; For instance, would it be possible to guarantee customers overnight delivery of the products they order&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> In order to investigate such and other questions using the handbook, the following steps could be taken. These steps are also identified as the activity of using the process handbook <highlight><bold>299</bold></highlight> in the accompanying <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, using a kind of representation shown and described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> First, specify the general situation from a list of &ldquo;generic&rdquo; processes that are available in the handbook (select point of entry <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>). The general situation can be selected at a rather high level of abstraction (e.g., &ldquo;Selling a product&rdquo;) or a more specific level (&ldquo;Direct mail sales&rdquo;). This provides an &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; or point of entry into the space of possible processes catalogued in the handbook. Choosing a more generic level opens up a wider range of comparative alternatives, which may or may not be relevant to the objectives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Second, within that general situation, select specific features or goals of interest (the activity of selecting goals <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). For example, in this case, one constraint is to sell three classes of products: computer hardware, software, and reference material. Two of these products (hardware and software) require a relatively large amount of customer service. Furthermore, as defined above, a very short response time is desirable (even overnight delivery, if possible). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Third, at this point, the handbook retrieves (or generates) a set of alternative organizational forms and displays them in a matrix with each alternative rated in terms of goals such as &ldquo;cost of sales&rdquo;, &ldquo;response time&rdquo;, and &ldquo;quality of customer service&rdquo;. In cases where it is difficult to evaluate an alternative reliably, the range of possibilities or the degree of uncertainty is indicated if the information is input as an attribute for the activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Fourth, the handbook also provides a variety of interactive ways to explore, compare, combine, and redesign the alternatives. For example, it is possible to: (a) view a flow diagram for each process, (b) examine the basis for the evaluation on each goal, (c) see &ldquo;tips&rdquo; for success in using the processes, and (d) find examples of specific companies that use the processes if such information is provided as attributes in the handbook. For instance, the processes used by Lands End, a widely admired mail order clothing company, might be described along with references to documents and other sources of more information. These third and fourth steps are the activity of identifying bundles and viewing alternatives <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. This activity is in a producer-consumer relationship with both of activities <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> as indicated by dependencies <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Fifth, eventually, some of the initial constraints may be relaxed to let the system suggest more radical innovations. For instance, what if the goods were distributed through a new chain of retail stores&quest; What if customers were allowed to place orders through PC-based programs or through touch-tone telephone systems&quest; Would it even be possible for all employees of the division to work at home, or for all the &ldquo;employees&rdquo; to work as independent contractors&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Of course, the desirability of these alternative processes will often depend on factors in the actual situation that are not represented in the handbook, and will rely on intelligent users to take these other factors into account. The handbook, however, can help these users systematically examine many possibilities they might never otherwise have considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing it should be apparent that such a process handbook may have many different uses, including primarily helping theoreticians imagine new organizations and helping consultants, managers, and others redesign existing organizations. It may also be useful for teaching about organizational activities. Finally, it may also enable the automatic generation of software for coordinating processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Of these uses, redesign of organizations has already been discussed. The handbook, because it provides a systematic representation of processes, also can help theoreticians make systematic, empirically-grounded suggestions about possible new organizational processes, especially those enabled by new information technology. This handbook should also be useful for suggesting responses to other environmental changes such as those in employees&apos; skills, legal constraints, or production technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The handbook also may be useful to students at various levels. For undergraduates unfamiliar with basic organizational functions, (e.g., marketing, personnel, accounting, purchasing, sales, manufacturing), the process handbook can provide an interactive overview of various organizations. For more advanced students, it can provide a way of learning about and comparing alternative designs for various organizational functions in different industries. Because it contains a database of processes, and an analytical framework with which to compare those processes, the handbook can also provide a valuable resource for creating and analyzing so-called &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> One of the more ambitious and interesting possible uses of the handbook is automatic generation of software to support the processes represented. For instance, we can imagine that when a group of employees recognizes that they all need to share use of the same machine, they might consult the handbook for a variety of alternative processes for scheduling shared resources (e.g., &ldquo;first come/first serve&rdquo;, &ldquo;priority order&rdquo;, &ldquo;bidding&rdquo;, and &ldquo;managerial decision&rdquo;). After the group selects one of these processes and specializes it for their own particular situation, a customized scheduling application could be automatically generated specifically tailored to the needs of this group. Software to support many other workflow processes (such as approval processes, hiring procedures, and equipment ordering methods) might also be easily generated using this approach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> An additional usefulness of this handbook is that the representation described is also applicable to computer processes and suggests the basis of a possible new computer language. In such a language, processes and their decompositions represent computational processes. Dependencies between these processes are managed by coordination processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Having now described a few embodiments of the invention, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing is merely illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example only. Numerous modifications and other embodiments are within the scope of one of ordinary skill in the art and are contemplated as falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a method and apparatus for distributing a request to one of a plurality of resources. A request is mapped to a location in mathematical mapping space. Each of the plurality of resources is mapped to a respective location or locations in the mathematical mapping space. The request is allocated to one of the resources based on a mathematical relationship between the request location and the resource location in the mathematical mapping space. An apparatus for distributing a request to one of a plurality of resources includes the plurality of resources and an input receiving a resource request. A mapper in communication with the input maps the request to a request location in a mathematical mapping space and maps each of the plurality of resources to at least one resource locations in the mathematical mapping space. A distributor distributes the request to one of the plurality of resources in response to a mathematical relationship between the locations of the request and resources in the mathematical mapping space. The invention also relates to a method and apparatus for requesting data from one of a plurality of servers. An virtual network of nodes is generated in response to a data request. A first node on the virtual network of nodes is chosen randomly, and a path generated from the first node to the root on the virtual network. At least one node on the path is mapped to a respective one of the plurality of servers and data is requested from a server. The node may be mapped to the server using the method and apparatus for distributing a request to one of a plurality of resources of the present invention. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to allocating resource requests to the available resources. More specifically, the invention relates to distributing information requests to servers capable of storing and providing the requested information. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In large distributed information systems there are servers that store information and there are clients that request information. The World Wide Web (&ldquo;Web&rdquo;) is an example of a distributed information system. There are web sites, which act as servers, and there are clients, which are computers used by people to obtain information from the servers. The users request information from the web sites and the web sites respond to the requests by providing the requested information in the form of data, documents, files, or web pages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Immense growth of the Web places great demands on the infrastructure of the Internet that provides the physical connections for the Web. Service providers invest vast sums of money in Internet infrastructure in an attempt to provide acceptable performance despite increasing data demand. Acceptable performance generally implies little or no delay in accessing information. Two causes of delay are heavy communication loading a part of a network and a large number of requests loading a particular server. When part of the network becomes congested with too much traffic, communication over that part of the network becomes unreliable and slow. Similarly, when too many requests are directed at a single server, the server becomes overloaded, or &ldquo;swamped.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One of these problems can cause the other, in part because network software is typically designed to repeat requests that are not responded to promptly. For example, if a server is overloaded, it will not respond to requests quickly, and requests may be resent, thereby increasing network traffic. If a network is overloaded, a request may not reach a server quickly, and a duplicate request may be sent to the server before the server had a chance to respond to the first request, thereby increasing the load on the server. Both network overload and server overload lead to delays in retrieving information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A server can become overloaded for various reasons. A server storing a few documents that have very high access rates can become overloaded. An example of this kind of server is a web site that becomes very popular such as a site reporting results of a popular sports event. A server responsible for such a site can become overloaded with a large volume of requests for a one or a small number of documents containing the latest information on the event. Another type of server that can become overloaded is a server storing a large number of documents each of which is accessed at normal or even relatively low access rates. The server becomes overloaded as it attempts to serve a large number of requests for many different documents. An example of this kind of server is a server for a large organization, such as a library, that serves a vast number of documents that are accessed on a regular basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A general strategy employed to reduce both network traffic and overloaded servers is replication accomplished by caching. Copies of frequently requested documents can be stored throughout the network, thereby spreading the work of serving the documents across several servers. In one approach, several clients share a cache server in a manner that is transparent to the people using it. Client requests are forwarded through the cache server, which keeps copies of frequently requested documents and attempts to satisfy requests with a cached copy. If the cache server has a copy of the document, then the request can be answered immediately with the requested document. If the cache server does not have a copy, then the cache server can request a copy of the document from the original site. When the cache server receives a copy of the document from another cache server or from the original site for the document, it can then answer the client&apos;s request. Subsequent requests for that document can be serviced by the cache because it has a copy of the document. Thus, the load on the original site for the document is reduced because the original site does not need to be involved in every request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, three clients, Client One <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, Client Two <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and Client Three <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, each request documents Doc1, Doc2, and Doc3 respectively via Cache Server A <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The cache server answers all three of these requests in a manner that is transparent to the users. If Server A <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> does not have the documents requested by Client One <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, Client Two <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and Client Three <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, it requests the documents from the Original Sites <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for the documents. Once it receives the documents it sends the documents to the Clients <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Caching can reduce network traffic if the cached copy is close, in the network topology sense, to the requester because fewer network links and resources are used to retrieve the information. Caching can also relieve an overloaded server because some of the requests that would normally be routed to the original site can be served by a cache server, and so the number of requests made of the original site is reduced. There is a tradeoff of a greater performance benefit if more clients share the same cache server that is balanced against an increased likelihood that the cache server itself will become overloaded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One approach to solving this dilemma is to use a group of servers that function together as a cache. Responsibility for answering requests is divided among the group. There are many ways to divide responsibility among the group of servers. One way is to have a client&apos;s request for a document be directed to an arbitrary one of the servers of the group of cache servers. If a copy of the document is stored in that server, it is transmitted to the client. If a copy is not stored in that server, the request is forwarded to the original site of the document. This approach divides the load among the servers, thereby preventing overload of any particular server. A client needs to know which servers are available, but the client does not need information about the servers to choose one. One disadvantage of this approach is that each of the servers will request each document from the original site for that document. This could load the original site as the number of cache servers increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the server could, if it does not have a copy of the document, first forward the request to the other cache servers. One disadvantage of this technique is that as the number of participating servers grows, the number of messages between the cache servers can become problematic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another approach also uses a group of servers but allocates responsibility for documents to particular servers. As part of this approach, the client is informed about the allocation of documents to servers so it can address a request to the server with responsibility for that document. Instead of arbitrarily choosing a cache, a client chooses the cache server allocated to the document requested. For this approach to be successful, it cannot be unduly burdensome on the client to determine which cache server to direct a document request. It is also necessary to balance the load appropriately among the caches. For example, even if all documents are accessed by clients at the same rate, if some caches contain more documents than others, those caches will have more requests to service, and may become overloaded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the context of caching, it would be unduly burdensome to maintain a list of all the documents available in the cache servers. Such a list would have to be maintained as documents were added and deleted from the original site. An alternative approach is for clients to use a standard hash function to determine from which server to request a document. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> standard hash function (h) is used by the clients to choose among three cache servers. Client One <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> requests Doc1 from Server A <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> since h(Doc1)&equals;Server A. Client Two <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> requests Doc2 from Server B <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> since h(Doc2)&equals;Server B. In this example, Server B <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> does not have the requested document, so it requests the document from the original site for Doc2 <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Client Three <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> requests Doc3 from Server C <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> since h(Doc3)&equals;Server C. Server C <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> does not have Doc3, so Server C <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> requests the document from Doc3&apos;s Original Site <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In this example, after obtaining a copy of the requested document, Server C <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> stores the document. When Client Four <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> requests Doc3, it also requests it from Server C <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, since h(Doc3)&equals;Server C. Server C <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> already has Doc3 since it previously obtained a copy to service the request from Client Three <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Server C <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is able to respond to the request without placing any additional load on the network between Server A <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and Server C <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and without requiring Server A <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to take on the load of the request from Client Four <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The hash function serves as a method for users to agree on which server is responsible for a document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Hashing with a standard hash function has the same effect as distributing the items randomly, because a standard hash function will tend to distribute items approximately evenly throughout its output range. This is very desirable because a random assignment of documents to servers will spread the load of serving the active set of documents among the servers. An example of a standard hash function that can be used to distribute documents to servers is f(d)&equals;((ad&plus;b)mod n), where document names (d) are integers, there are (n) servers &lcub;0, 1, 2, . . . , n&minus;1&rcub;, and (a) and (b) are some fixed choice of integers. For most choices of (a) and (b) the function distributes documents roughly evenly over the servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, an original distribution of one hundred thirty-four documents to servers is shown. Here, the document names are integers, and there are 13 servers &lcub;1, 2, . . . , 13&rcub;. Some servers store many more documents than others, and thus in the model of equal access frequency these servers are more heavily loaded. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows the distribution of documents to servers using a standard hash function such as f(d)&equals;((ad&plus;b)mod <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>). In the distribution of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, no server is responsible for a disproportionately large share of documents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> One disadvantage of using a standard hash function to allocate documents, and, therefore, documents requests, to servers is that a change in the number of servers can be disruptive to the caching scheme. In networks such as the Internet, servers frequently may be added to, or removed from, the network, and these changes need to be incorporated into a caching scheme. With the hash function just discussed, adding a server to the scheme requires changing the range of the hash function to include the new server. Changing the range of the hash function may result in many documents changing location. For example, if there are (n) servers and the hash function mapping documents to servers is f(d)&equals;((ad&plus;b)mod n), then when a server is added, the hash function is changed to f&prime;(d)&equals;((ad&plus;b)mod (n&plus;1)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> An example of the change of mapping of documents to servers caused by a change in the number of servers is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> illustrates the assignment of 10 documents to 4 servers using the hash function f(d)&equals;(d&plus;1)mod 4. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> illustrates the assignment after one additional server is added and the hash function is changed to f(d)&equals;(d&plus;1)mod 5. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, circles show the mapping with 4 servers and squares show the mapping with 5 servers. Almost every document is mapped to a different server as a result of the addition of the new server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A characteristic of this hash function and many other standard hash functions is that when the range of the function is modified, the mapping is completely reshuffled. That is, most documents are mapped to different servers than they were mapped to before the change. A complete reshuffling of the distribution of documents to servers is quite disruptive to a caching scheme. After each server is added, every server will need to request copies of the documents for which it is now responsible from the original document sites. Adding or removing a server, therefore, places a load on the cache servers and the original sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In addition to the problem of reshuffling data upon a change in the number of servers there is another complication. When a change in the number of servers occurs, users have to be notified of the change so that they can start to use a new hash function that includes the new number of cache servers. If users can be notified of the change simultaneously this does not present a problem, but in a network such as the Internet, such global synchronous notification is very difficult to achieve. It is feasible, however, to assume that notification about server changes can be done by slowly propagating the information from system to system, for example in a manner similar to the way that network news is distributed. As a consequence, the set of cache servers recognized by each user may differ widely. A user&apos;s &ldquo;view&rdquo; is a term for the set of servers that the user knows exist. Because synchronous notification is impossible, different users are very likely to have different views. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> can also be used to illustrate the effects of multiple views of the servers on the caching scheme. If some users are aware of the addition of server 4 and some of the users are not aware of the addition of server 4, then there are two views of the system held by users. One view (the &ldquo;old&rdquo; view) is &lcub;0,1,2,3&rcub; and the other view (the &ldquo;new&rdquo; view) is &lcub;0,1,2,3,4&rcub;. Users not aware of the addition of server 4 use the old mapping of documents to servers represented by the circles. Users aware of the new server 4 use the new mapping represented by the squares, which is almost a complete reshuffling of the old mappings. To work in a scheme where users have different views, cache servers must serve requests for the documents allocated in all users&apos; views. As a result, the number of documents that a server is responsible for, in this example in which one server was added, is almost doubled. For example, users with the old view use server 2 for the documents 5 and 29, while users with the new view use server 2 for documents 11 and 36. Server 2 will receive requests for all of these documents, thus effectively doubling the requirements on the server. The total number of documents that a server is responsible for is called its load. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the load of server 2 is 4 since there are two documents from each view. Using a standard hash function, each view increases the load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A further complication results from having a single document assigned to different cache servers in different views. If there are many clients with many different views, then a large number of cache servers can be responsible for a document. This in turn implies that the original site is more likely to become overloaded with requests for copies from multiple cache servers. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, document 7 is assigned to server 0 in the view &lcub;0,1,2,3&rcub; and to server 3 in the view &lcub;0,1,2,3,4&rcub;. The original site for document 7 has to supply a copy to both server 0 and server 3. The total number of servers to which a document is assigned is called the spread of the document. For example, the spread of document 5 in the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is 2. Using a standard hash function, the spread of a document increases with the number of views. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In summary, the use of standard hash functions to identify a resource (for example, a cache server) for a particular request (for example, a document) results in a greatly increased load and spread when the number of resources (cache servers) changes, and there are, accordingly, multiple views. This drawback can have a great impact on performance when the number of documents and servers is large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the approach of allocating responsibility for each document to different servers is less effective when the cache is experiencing a large number of requests for the same small number of documents. The large number of requests will all go to the small number of servers responsible for the small number of documents The small number of servers are likely to be overloaded by the large number of requests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> One approach for preventing one server from being overloaded by a large number of requests for the same document is to use a group of caches in series between the user and the original site of the document, each of which can service the request for the document. In one embodiment of this approach, if a first cache server does not have a document, it requests the document from another (second) cache and not the original site. The second cache services a defined group of first-level caches. If the second cache does not have the document, the second cache requests the document from yet another (third) cache. The third cache services a defined group of second-level caches. This continues until the last cache in the series does not have the document, at which point the last cache requests the document from the original site. This approach provides cache layers between the first cache and the original site and it spreads the load among the caches at each layer. Different users can use different lists of caches for the same document, thereby spreading the load. The list of servers to request the document from can be derived in various ways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> One approach is to use a tree of caches. In this approach, a user requests a document by requesting the document from a server representing a first node on a tree of caches. If this cache does not have the document, the request is forwarded to the next cache in the tree. If the next cache does not have the document, the request is forwarded from that cache to the next cache and so on. If a document is not stored by any intermediate cache in the tree, the request eventually reaches the root of the tree and is forwarded to the original site of the document. In this approach, a cache retains a copy of any document it obtains for a period of time. An advantage of a cache tree is that a cache receives document requests only from the caches that come before it, and this limits the number of requests that arrive simultaneously. Thus, many requests for a document in a short period of time will only cause one request to the original server of the document, and will not result in cache server overload. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One theoretical disadvantage of this system is that the root receives at least one request for every distinct document requested of the entire cache tree. This can overload the root with requests if the number of distinct document requests grows too large, meaning that this approach suffers from potential scaling problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention is a caching system that prevents server and network overloading and scales gracefully even when clients have multiple views. Resources can be added and removed from a pool of available resources without a reallocation of all or even most of the requests. Only the requests associated with the server added or removed have to be reallocated. This is referred to as &ldquo;consistent hashing&rdquo; because for most of the set of requests, the allocation is consistent even as resources are added and removed. Only a subset of all the requests are allocated to different resources. With regard to caching data, consistent hashing avoids increasing load and spread when the number of servers changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, a series of servers is used that are chosen in a manner that spreads the load associated with a small number of frequently requested documents, and thereby prevents overloading. This is referred to as &ldquo;virtual networks.&rdquo; When used together, consistent hashing and virtual networks improve the ability of document servers generally and caching servers in particular to respond to large numbers of requests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for distributing a request to one of a plurality of resources that includes mapping the request to a request location in mathematical mapping space, mapping each of the resources to a respective at least one resource location in mathematical mapping space, and allocating the request to one of the resources based on a mathematical relationship between the request and resource locations. An apparatus for distributing a request to one of a plurality of resources includes the plurality of resources and an input receiving a resource request. A mapper in communication with the input maps the request to a request location in a mathematical mapping space and maps each of the plurality of resources to at least one resource locations in the mathematical mapping space. A distributor distributes the request to one of the plurality of resources in response to a mathematical relationship between the locations of the request and resources in the mathematical mapping space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the mathematical mapping space is a circle. In one embodiment the request is a data request and the resource is a server. In one embodiment the step of mapping each of the resources to a respective at least one resource location comprises hashing each of the resources to a respective resource location in the mathematical mapping space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a computer-readable medium whose contents cause a computer system to distribute a request to one of a plurality of resources. The computer system executes the contents of the computer-readable medium by performing a computer program. The computer program maps the request to a request location in a mathematical mapping space and maps each of the resources to a respective at least one location in the mathematical mapping space. The computer program allocates the request to one of the resources based on a relationship between the request location and the resource locations in the mathematical mapping space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for requesting data from one of a plurality of servers. The method includes generating an virtual network of nodes in response to a data request and randomly choosing a first node on the virtual network of nodes. The method also includes generating a path from the first node to the root node on the virtual network of nodes and mapping at least one node on the path to a respective one of the plurality of servers. The method also includes requesting data from the one of the plurality of servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the step of requesting data from one of the plurality of servers is accomplished with a data request comprising identification of the desired data and a sequence of nodes through which the request should be directed. In one embodiment, the data request also comprises a sequence of servers that should act as the nodes. In one embodiment requesting the data from the server mapped to the chosen node includes transmitting a request from a client to the server. In one embodiment mapping at least one node on the path to a respective one of the plurality of servers comprises calculating a hash function. In one embodiment mapping a node on the path to a respective one of the servers includes mapping the node to a node location and each of the servers to at least one server location in a mathematical mapping space and allocating the node to one of the servers based on a mathematical relationship between the node location and the server locations in the mathematical mapping space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to an apparatus for requesting data from one of a plurality of servers. The apparatus includes an input receiving a data request and a path generator in communication with the input that randomly chooses a node on an virtual network and generates at least one path of nodes in response to the data request. The apparatus also includes a mapper in communication with the path generator mapping nodes on the at least one path of nodes to one of the plurality of servers. The apparatus also includes an output in communication with the mapper and requesting data from the one of the plurality of servers mapped to the nodes on the at least one path of nodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for responding to data requests made by a client. The method includes receiving a first data request that includes a sequence of nodes corresponding to a sequence of servers. The method also includes determining whether the data specified in the data request is not available on a selected server. If the data is not available, the method also includes determining a next node from the sequence of nodes, mapping a server to the next node, and requesting the data by transmitting a second data request to the server mapped to the next node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the step of mapping a server to the next node comprises calculating a hash function. In one embodiment the first data request is substantially similar to the second data request. In one embodiment the second data request includes a sequence of nodes. In one embodiment the method further includes receiving the data from the server mapped to the next node in response to the second data request, determining the total number of times the data in the first data request has been requested, and caching the data requested by the first data request if the count of the number of times the data in the first data request was requested exceeds a threshold. In one embodiment the method includes the step of responding to the first request by transmitting the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to an apparatus for responding to data requests made by a client. The apparatus includes an input receiving a first data request that includes a sequence of nodes corresponding to a sequence of servers. The apparatus also includes decision logic determining whether the data specified in the data request is available on a selected server, and if the data is not available determining a next node from the sequence of nodes. The apparatus also includes a mapper mapping a server to the next node. The apparatus also includes an output requesting the data by transmitting a second data request to the server mapped to the next node.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention a mathematical mapping space is chosen and a mapping is used to locate requests and resources in the mathematical space. A specific mathematical relationship is also chosen to match a request with a resource in the mathematical space. A request is assigned to the resource whose location in the mapping space has the specific mathematical relationship with the request&apos;s location in the mathematical mapping space. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A, a</cross-reference> request is mapped to at least one location in the mathematical mapping space (Step <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>). Available resources are each mapped to at least one location in the mathematical mapping space (Step <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight>). These steps, step <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> and step <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight>, do not have to occur in the order shown, each can be accomplished independently from the other. In fact, in one embodiment, the resources are mapped once, and the mapping is stored for future use with each request. Having mapped the request and the resources to the mathematical mapping space, the request is allocated to a resource based on a mathematical relationship between the request and the resource in the mathematical mapping space (Step <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> By way of example, in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> client wants to request a document from a server. In this embodiment, the request is a document request and the resources are cache servers Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and Server B <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. The client <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> requests Doc1 from a server. Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, the client <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> selects Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by first mapping the request for Doc1 and the available servers Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and Server B <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> into a previously selected mathematical mapping space. An embodiment of a mathematical mapping space <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is a two dimensional space of real numbers. Doc1 <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is mapped into the mathematical mapping space <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, as are Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and Server B <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the resource that is the least distance from the request is allocated to the request. In other embodiments, other mathematical relationships could be used. Client One <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> then allocates the request to Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> based on the distance relationship between Doc1 and Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in the mathematical mapping space. The distance <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> between Doc1 <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is less than the distance between Doc1 <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and Server B <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. Doc1 <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is therefore allocated to Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The client <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> then requests Doc1 from Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the client <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> requests Doc2 from Server B <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> after mapping Doc2 and the servers into mathematical mapping space <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and determining that the distance <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> between Doc2 <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and Server A <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is more than the distance <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> between Doc2 <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and Server B <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The mapping space may be any mapping space in which the requests and resources can be mapped. A mapping space is preferred that allows for efficient mapping and matching of resources to requests. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the mathematical mapping space is a two dimensional space of real numbers. In another embodiment, the mapping space is a line. In another embodiment, the mapping space is the three dimensional space of real numbers. In another embodiment, the mapping space has more than three dimensions. In another embodiment, the mapping space is a circle. In one embodiment, the mapping space is a circle with a circumference of one. In yet another embodiment, the mapping space is an ellipse. In another embodiment, the mapping space is a three dimensional sphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the mapping of requests and resources to the mathematical mapping space is accomplished with a hash function. A hash function takes an input (k) and returns an output in a given range. Hash functions can be used to allocate pointers or keys to a location in a hash table, which is a data structure having a specified number of locations or &ldquo;slots.&rdquo; If h(k) is a hash function, key (k) is said to hash to a hash table location h(k). A goal in designing a hash function is for each key (k) to be equally likely to hash to any of the locations in the hash table. An approach to achieve this is to derive the hash function in a way that is expected to be independent of any patterns that might exist in the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Most hash functions assume that the universe of keys is the set of natural numbers. If the input value to a hash function is not a natural number, some way is usually found to interpret the input value as a natural number. For example, if a character string is to be used as input to a hash function, it can be interpreted as an integer expressed in suitable radix notation. As an example, the string &ldquo;mit.edu&rdquo; could be interpreted as an integer by using the ASCII decimal conversion of the letters in the string, and treating each character as a radix 128 number, so the result would be the sum: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> (109*128<highlight><superscript>0</superscript></highlight>)&plus;(105*128<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>)&plus;(116*128<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>)&plus;(46*128<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>)&plus;(101*128<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>)&plus;100*128<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>)&plus;(117*128<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In a division method for creating hash functions, a key (k) is mapped into one of m locations by taking the remainder of (k) divided by (m). That is, the simplest form of such a hash function looks like h(k)&equals;(k mod m). Using this simple example, if the hash table has size (m&equals;12) and the key is (k&equals;100), then h(k)&equals;4. Since it requires only a single division operation, hashing by division is quite fast. More complicated hash functions can be constructed using a division method, for example, h(k)&equals;((ak&plus;b)mod n) for some fixed choice of integers (a) and (b), and (n) locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a family of hash functions is used whose elements are each functions that map requests and resources to locations in mathematical mapping space. A random function (f) is chosen from such a family of hash functions (H) and function (f) is used to map requests and resources to locations. This family model of hashing is used because schemes that use a single fixed function are vulnerable to attack by parties attempting to damage the system, since the input that causes the absolute worst case behavior of the scheme can be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> For example, if an adversary has the power to selectively disable some number of resources, and the mapping of requests and resources to the mapping space is known to the adversary, then the adversary can selectively disable those resources that would leave a remaining resource heavily loaded, and possibly overloaded. The adversary can eliminate all resources in a portion of the mapping space, creating a gap with no resources at all. All the requests previously assigned to the eliminated resources might then be assigned to a resource whose location is on the edge of the gap. This resource might then become overloaded with requests. A way to foil such an intentional destruction of the system is to add randomization to the scheme. For example, if the locations in mapping space associated with requests and resources are chosen randomly, and an adversary is not aware of the random choices, then the adversary does not know the locations of the requests and resources in the mapping space. Therefore the adversary does not have the necessary information to selectively disable resources located in a particular part of the mapping space. Another technique to foil such an attack is to map multiple points for each resource into the mapping space. This is discussed further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Randomization is added by choosing a mapping function from a family of hash Functions so that there is a uniform probability of choosing every function. Thus, using a hash family (H) means that first a function (f&egr;H) is selected and then that function is used to map requests to resources. For example, if both the set of (request and resource) items (I) and the set of (location) buckets B are in the range &lcub;0,1,2, . . . , p&minus;1&rcub; for a prime p, then the family (H) could be defined as all the functions of the form f(x)&equals;((ax&plus;b)mod p) for all a, b &egr; &lcub;0,1,2, . . . , p&minus;1&rcub;. To use this hash family, a and b are chosen at random, and this is equivalent to choosing a function from the family at random. Then, a request or resource item is assigned to location ((aR&plus;b )mod p). In other words, the probability that a randomly chosen function (f) from the family (H) maps the request (x) to resource (i) and the request (y) to resource (j) is the same as in the case in which the two requests are mapped to the resources uniformly and independently. The family (H) is used instead of choosing a completely random function because choosing, storing, and evaluating functions from H is simple and efficient. Constants (a) and (b) can be chosen at random. These values can be stored using very little memory, and the resulting function can be evaluated simply. On the other hand, selecting a truly random function requires choosing and storing a random table containing the value of the function for every single item or seeding a known random number generator with a known value. Such a hash function may be implemented in hardware or software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Although randomization helps balance load, the mapping does not have to be entirely random. Other information about the request of the resource can be used to map the request or resource into the mathematical mapping space. For example, geographic information may be useful for placing requests and resources located geographically near each other at least somewhat proximate in the mathematical mapping space. Similarly, it might be helpful for the location of a request or resource in a network topology to influence the location in the mathematical mapping space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> For example, if the mathematical mapping space is a grid with geographical map coordinates, the mapping function could be a random distribution around the geographic location of the resource. The random distribution would help to balance the load, and the geographic bias would help match requests and resources that are geographically proximate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The mathematical relationship that is used to match requests with resources can be any mathematical relationship that allows requests to be matched with resources. A mathematical relationship is preferred that can be determined efficiently. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> the resource that is the least distance from the request is allocated to the request. In other embodiments in which the mathematical space is a circle, a request is assigned to the resource whose location is the first encountered when the mapping space is traversed either clockwise or counter-clockwise from the request&apos;s location. In other embodiments, the request may be assigned to the resource whose location is any specific number of points from the request location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Once a request has been matched with a resource according to the relationship of the request and the resource in the mathematical mapping space, the request is allocated to the resource. In one embodiment, the allocation is reported to the operating system, user, browser, or other entity that will use the information. In another embodiment, the allocation takes place automatically so that the reporting actually allocates the resource. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, documents are allocated to a plurality of caching servers. The mathematical mapping space that is used is a circle that has a radius of 1. Both documents and servers are mapped to points on the circle using a hash function, as indicated by document points D1-D8 and server points S1-S6 on the circle. A document is to be assigned to the closest server moving clockwise around the circle. Arrow CW shows the clockwise direction of mapping of documents to servers. In this embodiment, Document D1 is assigned to server S1, document D2 is assigned to server S3, documents D3 and D4 are assigned to server S4, document D5 is assigned to server S5, and documents D6, D7, and D8 are mapped to server S6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> depicts an embodiment of the same system after a new server is added. The new server is shown as Server S7. With the addition of the new server, the only documents that are reassigned are those now closest to the new server going clockwise around the circle. Thus only documents D6 and D7 move to Server S7, other documents remain with the server they were previously matched with. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> shows the change in the mapping of documents to servers before and after the addition of a new server. Circles are the previous mapping (as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>) and squares show the new mapping (as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>). This shows a significant improvement over the results in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in that many fewer documents have changed servers with the addition of a new server. In fact, only the documents associated with the new Server S7 are reallocated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, if a document is assigned to a server in one view, then that document&apos;s location in the mapping space is likely to be relatively close to the server&apos;s location in the mapping space in all views. This is because another server would probably be in between the document and the server if the document and the server were not close to each other. If, in this embodiment, server points are evenly distributed around the circle, only a few document points fall close to a server&apos;s point. Even if there are a large number of views, only a relatively small number of documents will be assigned to a server, and the load should not increase more than logarithmically with the number of views. Likewise, even if there are many views, only a few servers will have responsibility for any one document. The spread of a document therefore does not increase dramatically with the number of views. These properties allow a caching scheme to grow gracefully. Servers can be added to the network without disrupting the caching and multiple views of the servers can exist without degrading the performance of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The benefits of decreased load and spread depend on an even distribution of the resources in the mapping space. In one embodiment, requests and resources are mapped to random points around a circle, and a request is mapped to the resource whose point is encountered first when the circle is traversed clockwise from the item&apos;s point. In this embodiment, there is a small probability that points could be distributed badly around the circle so that one resource is responsible for a disproportionate section of the circle. Such an unfortunate instance is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in which points 6A-6F are all on one side of the circle. All request points on the left half of the circle would be mapped to resource 6A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, in order to decrease the likelihood of such an unlucky event as the poor distribution of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> resource is assigned to two or more locations in the mapping space instead of just one. In this embodiment, requests are still assigned to a single point on the circle and are mapped to the resource that has a point nearest to the request&apos;s point in a predetermined direction. When the number of resource points (m) is larger, there is less of a chance that the points will be unequally distributed around the circle. The number of resource points (m) need not be unmanageably large for there to be a very good chance of an even distribution of points in the mapping space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the mapping space is a circle as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, the mapping function is chosen from the family of standard hash functions y&equals;(ax&plus;b)mod n. The number of points (n) is the number of possible points that the requests and resources can be mapped to. Four sets of constants (a) and (b) are chosen randomly to map the resources and one set of constants (a) and (b) are chosen to map the requests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The use of multiple points has the added benefit of making it much harder for an adversary to create holes in the mapping by selectively eliminating a small subset of the servers, thereby overloading a remaining server and causing it to crash, which will then overload another server and cause it to crash, and so on. If the multiple points for each server are evenly and randomly distributed in the mapping space, the elimination of one server will not put a great burden on any one or subset of the remaining servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, resources B1 and B2 each have 4 points on the circle. Requests are mapped to the resource closest to the resource in the mapping space as measured in a clockwise direction. Request <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is closest in a clockwise direction to a point of resource B1 and request <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is closest in a clockwise direction to another point of resource B2. Requests <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> are closest in a clockwise direction to another point of resource B1. Request <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is closest in a clockwise direction to another point of resource B1. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the circular mapping space is drawn as a linear interval of length one where we imagine that the endpoints of the interval are &ldquo;glued together.&rdquo; The points on the line mark the intervals shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. The intervals indicate the mapping space that resources B1 and B2 are responsible for. Resource points are responsible for the interval from the location of the resource to the next point directly to the left. Since there are multiple copies of each resource, resources are responsible for a set of intervals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> When a resource is mapped to multiple points, there is a small but positive probability that when a random function is chosen from the family, two points from one resource could be mapped to the same location in the mapping space. In one embodiment, if this happens, some arbitrary fixed order of the assigning the points on the circle is used. In another embodiment, the probability that such a function is chosen is made arbitrarily small by using more bits of precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a request is made to the first resource in a particular direction around the circle. If that resource does not have the item, the request is made to the next resource clockwise around the circle. In this way, a path is determined of resources to query for a request. In one embodiment, this is combined with the virtual networks discussed below, but it can also be used instead of the virtual networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a request is always mapped to the same location in the mathematical mapping space. Each resource is mapped into the mathematical mapping space using a mapping function that is a function of the resource and the request. Because the resource mapping function is a function of both the resource and the request, the locations of the resources in the mapping space will depend, in part, on the request. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a circular mathematical mapping space is shown where the request <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is always mapped to the origin point at the top of the circle. The resources <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> are mapped to the mathematical mapping space using a mapping function that is a function of the resource and the request. Such a function, for example, might be (((f(i)&middot;ax)&plus;b)mod n), where f(i) is a function of the request (i), (x) is the resource to be mapped, (a) and (b) are constants, and (n) is the number of points around the circle. The result is that for one value of (i), (for example, i&equals;1), resource (x) will be mapped to one location, and for a different value of (i), (for example, i&equals;2), resource (x) may be mapped to a different location, depending on f(i), that is, depending on whether f(1) is different than f(2). Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, the step of mapping the request in step <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> would always map the request to the same location. Mapping the resources into the mathematical mapping space in step <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> would occur using a mathematical mapping function that takes into account both the request and the resource. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, an embodiment of an apparatus according to the present invention includes an input <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, which receives a resource request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>. The input <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> receives the request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> and passes the request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> on to the distributor <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the input <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> receives a request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> over a computer network. In another embodiment, the input <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> receives a request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> from another process on the same computer. The input <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> can be implemented in hardware or software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The distributor <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> uses the mapper <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> to map the request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> and the resources <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> into a mathematical mapping space and to determine the allocation of the request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> to one of the resources <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the mapper <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> includes mapping space data stored in a binary tree structure for fast access. Each resource is stored in the binary tree, and then the request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> can be matched to one of the resources <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> by searching the tree. Other types of storage structures can be used as well, for example an array or linked list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the mapping space store has a function AddResource(r), which adds a resource to the store. It also has a function DeleteResource(r), which deleted a resource from the store. It also has a function MatchRequest(r), which provides the resource that is greater than or equal to (r). If there is no such resource, meaning that the request has wrapped around the circle, the MatchRequest(r) function provides the resource at the smallest numbered point. The distributor <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> accesses the mapper through the functions just described. By using the MatchRequest(r) function, the distributor <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> can allocate the request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> to one of the resources. The mapper <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> can be implemented in hardware or software. The mapper <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> can store the locations of the resources in a tree structure as described, or it can receive a list of the resources <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> to be mapped with each request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the distributor <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> periodically obtains information about the resources <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> that are available, so that it can use the AddResource( ) and DeleteResource( ) functions to keep the view current. After selecting one of the resources <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> to allocate to the request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>, the distributor <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> allocates the request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> to the one of the resources <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>, and outputs any information necessary to allocate the request <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> to the resource via output <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Virtual Networks </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The consistent hashing method and apparatus just described is particularly useful when combined with another aspect of the present invention, in which a virtual network of cache servers is used to prevent any server from having too many requesters asking it for a particular document. The virtual network does not require an unmanageable number of messages to be communicated among the servers, and at the same time provides for a low probability that any server will be overloaded. A different network of servers is used for each particular document. Use of a different network for each document spreads the load so that none of the servers is at the same part of the network for a disproportionate number of documents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a client requesting data from a group of servers uses a virtual network of nodes that are not initially mapped to servers. The client chooses a first node on the virtual network to be the node that will receive the client&apos;s request. The root node is the last node before a request is passed on to the original site for the document. The choice of a first node may dictate, at least in part, a path of nodes from the first node to a root node on the virtual network. As described further below, the client then maps the nodes on the path of nodes in the virtual network to actual servers. Having mapped the nodes to servers, the client requests the data from the server mapped to the first node. In one embodiment, the request includes the path of nodes and the servers mapped to those nodes. If the server mapped to the first node does not have the document, the server mapped to the first node requests the document from the server mapped to the next mode on the path from the first node to the root node in the virtual network of nodes. If this server does not have the document, it will in turn ask the server corresponding to the next node on the path. Each server that maps to a node on the path from the first node to root node may ultimately be queried for the document if the document is not located on the proceeding node. Finally, if the server that maps to the root node does not have the document, the server that maps to the root node will request the document from the original site for the document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> group of thirteen cache servers <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> are individual computers, each with their own RAM, ROM, processor(s), and storage media. The servers <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> are connected by a network <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>. Together, servers <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight> handle requests for documents. The number of servers is not central to the invention. There can be as few as two servers, and an unlimited maximum number of servers. The type of server is also not central to the invention. In another embodiment, the servers are each individual processor boards connected to a single bus and network interface. In yet another embodiment, the servers are individual software processes that execute on a multithreaded computer system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of an virtual network of nodes that can be used with the server group of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. This particular embodiment shows a tree structure, but the invention is not limited to tree networks. Each of the thirteen nodes <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> represents one cache. Each node <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> can be mapped to a server <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows one mapping of the virtual network of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> to the servers of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In this mapping, root node <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> is mapped to Server One. Middle Node A <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> is mapped to Server Two. First Node A <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> is mapped to Server Five. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows an alternate mapping of the virtual network of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> to the servers of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In this mapping, root node <highlight><bold>1151</bold></highlight> is mapped to Server Thirteen. Middle Node A <highlight><bold>1152</bold></highlight> is mapped to Server Ten. First Node A is mapped to Server One. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> These are just two of the many possible mappings of the virtual network of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> to the servers of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. The examples of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> demonstrate that the different mappings from virtual network to servers map different servers at each level of the network. For example, in the mapping of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, Server One is mapped to the root node <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>. In the mapping of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, Server One is mapped to First Node A <highlight><bold>1155</bold></highlight>. If different mappings are used for different documents, there will be some documents for which a particular server will be the root, and there will be other documents for which that server will be a first node or middle node. This distributes the load associated with a particular position in the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Mapping of the virtual nodes to servers can be accomplished using a standard hash function. The mapping can also be accomplished with the consistent hashing of the present invention. Consistent hashing provides the added benefit of allowing servers to be added and removed without disrupting the caching scheme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, none of the virtual nodes <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> are initially mapped to a particular server. A first node on the virtual network is chosen. In one embodiment, the first node is chosen randomly from all of the nodes on the virtual network. In another embodiment, the first node is chosen from a subset of the first nodes determined by the identity of the client. In another embodiment, the first node is chosen from a subset of the first nodes determined by the document requested. The choice of a first node dictates, at least in part, a path of nodes from the first node to the root node. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows the virtual node network of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> in which first node D <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> on the virtual network has been chosen. This dictates a path from first node D <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> to next node B <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight> to root <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Once a first node has been chosen and a path of nodes determined, the nodes on the path of nodes can be mapped to the actual servers. Each node on the path can be mapped to a server. In a preferred embodiment, the mapping of nodes to servers is based on the name of the document requested. Having mapped the nodes to servers, the client requests the data from the server mapped to the first node. In one embodiment, the request includes the path of nodes and the servers mapped to those nodes. If the server mapped to the first node does not have the document, it will request the document from the server mapped to the next node of the first node in the virtual network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, each node on the virtual network of nodes is first mapped to a server, thereby determining a network of servers for a particular document. A first server on the network of servers, and a path from the first server to the root can then be chosen for a request. While this ordering of steps is also a functional embodiment of the invention, it has the disadvantage of requiring all nodes to be mapped. Choosing a path on the virtual network first, and then mapping the nodes on the path second, requires fewer nodes to be mapped to servers, and therefore requires less calculation time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the request does not include the path of nodes and servers mapped to those nodes. In this embodiment, each server that needs to request the document from another server uses the information about the document requested to create its own virtual network, map nodes to servers and determine the next server. In this embodiment, the client need only determine the server mapped to the first node, and not the entire path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, when a server receives a request, it first checks to see if it is caching a copy of the document or is in the process of getting one to cache. If so, it returns the document to the requester, after it gets its copy if necessary. Otherwise, it increments a request counter for the document requested and the virtual node it is acting as, and asks the next server on the path for the document. If the request counter reaches a defined number of requests, when acting as a particular virtual node, then the cache server caches a copy of the document. In either case the cache passes the document on to the requester when it is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> When consistent hashing is used to map nodes to servers, there is an additional benefit that servers can be added and removed without disrupting the caching scheme. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>A, an embodiment of a virtual network is shown in which two clients C1 and C2 have different views. C1 is aware of servers &lcub;1 . . . 6&rcub; and C2 is aware of servers &lcub;1 . . . 7&rcub;. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</cross-reference> shows a virtual network mapped to servers using a standard hash function for a particular document for the two views. In the first view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A, C</cross-reference>1 starts with the server mapped to node 5. The path from first node to root is 5-1-3. In the second view, the servers are mapped very differently because of the addition of a new server. C2 starts with the node mapped to server 6, and the path is 6-7-2. No servers are the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>B, the same views are shown, but with the mapping of nodes to servers using consistent hashing. In the first view, C1 first requests from the node mapped to server 6. The path is 6-4-1. In the second view, using consistent hashing, the mapping is much closer to that of the first view than it was with the standard hash function. The first node is the node mapped to server 7. The path is 7-4-1. Since the nodes mapped to servers 4 and 1 are the same servers in both views, it is likely that server 4 or server 1 will have a copy of the document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the disclosed embodiment of a non-hierarchical virtual network is a circle with spokes connected to center node 16F. The root of this virtual network is the center node 16F, and any node 16A-16E on the circle can be the first node. As described above, a hierarchical network has beneficial properties, such as being useful for reducing hot spots. Other virtual networks, like the one in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> have other benefits, such as a resemblance to an existing network topology, or utility for a particular routing protocol. As in the hierarchical network, a first node is chosen to receive a particular request, and a path chosen from the first node to the root node for that request. For the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the path is chosen by a clockwise traversal of the circle. When the requests have gone around the circle and reached the node before the first node, the request is then passed to the root. After the path has been chosen, the nodes are mapped to servers. The nodes can be mapped to servers using a hash function that takes into account the information being retrieved. The hash function may also take into account other factors. Use of the consistent hashing described above provides the added benefits discussed earlier, such as the ability to add and remove servers without disrupting the caching scheme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Having described preferred embodiments of the invention, it will now become apparent to one of skill in the art that other embodiments incorporating the concepts may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The invention as described with regard to cache servers works equally well for general storage of objects in a computer or computer network, where the requests are data to be stored or retrieved from a data store and the resources are the data store. For example, the invention is applicable to a collection of documents that spans multiple disks, or other large data store, within a single computer system. Consistent hashing can be used to allocate documents to disks. This would help balance load, and allow for addition and removal of disks with a minimum data reorganization. Virtual networks of caches could be used in such a system between the disks and one or more processors. This would particularly be useful for a computer system storing many documents on many devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Networked distributed file systems, groups of computers that store large amounts of data on an intranet or internet, and have too much information to effectively serve on one server, can use the invention to great benefit. Consistent hashing can be used to allocate documents to servers, thereby making it possible for servers to be added and removed from such a system with minimal impact on the locations of much of the data stored in the servers. A virtual network of caches can stand between the users of the distributed file system and the distributed file system, to spread the load on the servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> An example of such a system is a large library of documents. Another example is a personal file service. Such a service would allow a user to store his files on a collection of central servers. Any device connected to the network having proper authentication could have access to those files. The files could include such computer data such as electronic, video, and voice messages, commonly referred to as email and voicemail. Such a personal file service, if implemented for large number of users, would benefit from the consistent hashing and replication of the present invention. It could, for example, enable large scale military command and control systems. Such a system could deliver messages that simulate a broadcast, by allowing many users to access files at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Another application of the present invention is in the area of servicing requests for suddenly popular web pages. A server system using the present invention can provide service for &ldquo;hot&rdquo; web sites that experience short-term traffic surges. For example, sites providing a new release of software, recent photographs from outer space exploration (as occurred with the Mars lander), and sites reporting scores during a sports event of limited duration (such as during a college basketball tournament) receive extremely high volumes of requests for relatively short periods of time. The short periods might not justify a significant hardware investment. A server enabled by the present invention could be farmed out these sites to handle high-traffic periods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> A file system capable of handling many document requests also enables delivery of digital motion pictures and other content on demand using a computer network as a delivery system. In such a system, motion pictures are stored in time slice increments such as one minute intervals. A two hundred minute movie then consists of two hundred files, each of which can be retrieved from a server. Delivering a movie to many users would place a great load on one server, yet, by breaking the movie up into manageable chunks, it can be delivered effectively from multiple servers. By incorporating the present invention into such a delivery system, the load of delivering the documents can be spread evenly, and with the possibility of adding and removing servers without reshuffling the entire file system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Other areas in which requests are allocated to resources that could benefit from the present invention include, but are not limited to a user allocated to one of a plurality of data channels in a communications network, a telephone caller allocated to one of a plurality of operators, and a physical object allocated to one of a plurality of storage locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> It is felt, therefore, that these embodiments of the invention should not be limited to disclosed embodiments but rather should be limited only by the spirit and scope of the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention is in the field of plant breeding. In particular, this invention relates to the isolation of new maize mutants with reduced gene silencing activity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The goal of <highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>L. (corn) breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single variety/hybrid. Such desirable traits include greater yield, better stalks, better roots, resistance to pesticides, pests and disease, tolerance to heat and drought, reduced time to crop maturity, better agronomic quality, higher nutritional value, and uniformity in germination times, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity and fruit size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Modern molecular biology and transgenic technologies (genetic engineering) have greatly accelerated the introduction of new genes and, hence, new traits into corn lines. While useful, genetic engineering is hampered by transgene silencing problems. Transgene silencing is a little understood process by which genes introduced by genetic engineering are silenced or turned off. As such, transgene silencing is a major impediment to the use of genetic engineering for corn improvement. At present, the solution to transgene silencing is to search through a large number of transgenic events for transgene loci that are active and stable. This is a painstaking and laborious process, which greatly increases the cost of corn breeding using genetic engineering techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In addition to transgene silencing, there are other examples of gene silencing that are variable, unstable, but heritable. In corn these include the cycling of transposable elements between active and inactive states and paramutafion, gene silencing that occurs through interactions between specific alleles of a gene. The mechanism of silencing is not understood in any case, but current hypotheses invoke heritable alterations to chromatin structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There are no known mutants in corn that can prevent or reverse gene silencing. The availability of genetic stocks that prevent the establishment or maintenance of transgene silencing would be extremely useful for engineering and breeding new corn lines. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to meet these needs, the present invention is directed to new corn lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In particular, the present invention is directed to a mutant corn plant wherein upon propagation a change in gene activity of a paramutable allele of the mutant corn plant due to its exposure to a paramutagenic allele is reduced as compared to a wild type plant or wherein the gene activity of a paramutagenic allele of the mutant plant is not maintained as compared to a wild type plant. In one format the change in gene activity of an B-I allele due to exposure to a B&prime; allele is prevented in the mutants. In another format, the change in gene activity of an PI-Rh allele due to its exposure to a PI&prime; allele is reduced in the mutants. In another format, the change in activity of an R-d allele due to exposure to an PI&prime; allele is increased in the mutants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to a mutant corn plant derived from a wild type corn plant wherein the mutant corn plant comprises one or more mutations that reduce the establishment, or the maintenance of paramutation or both, in the mutant corn plant as compared to the wild type corn plant. In one embodiment, the mutation is a dominant mutation. In another embodiment, the mutation is a recessive mutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one format, the mutant corn plant of the invention is reduced in the establishment of paramutation at the b1 locus. In another format, the mutant corn plant of the invention is reduced in the establishment of paramutation at the r1 locus. In another format, the mutant corn plant of the invention is reduced in the establishment of paramutation at the pI1 locus. In yet another format paramutation is not established at the b1, r1 and/or pI1 loci in the mutant corn plant of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another format, the mutant corn plant is reduced in the maintenance of paramutation at the pI1 locus. In another format, the mutant corn plant is reduced in the heritable maintenance of paramutation at the pI1 locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to seed produced by the mutant corn plants of the invention. The invention is further directed to progeny seed produced by crossing the mutant corn plants of the invention with another corn plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to tissue culture of regenerable cells of the mutant corn plants of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to a mutant corn plant that fails to maintain the B&prime; paramutant state, manifest as an increase of 2-3 fold or greater of b1 RNA levels relative to a corresponding wild type plant and to progeny seed produced therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to a mutant corn plant that fails to maintain the PI&prime; paramutant state, manifest as an increase of 2-3 fold or greater of pI1 RNA levels relative to a corresponding wild type plant and to progeny seed produced therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to a mutant corn plant that fails to heritably maintain the PI&prime; paramutant state, manifest as transmission of nonparamutagenic pI1 alleles from a homozygous PI&prime; genotype, and to progeny seed and plants derived therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to a mutant corn plant, in which the normally invariant occurrence of paramutation at the b1, pI1 or r1 loci is prevented, and to progeny seed and plants derived therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to a mutant corn plant exhibiting reduced methylation of Mutator elements in the absence of active MUDR elements, relative to a corresponding wild type plant with methylated Mutator elements and to progeny seed and plants derived therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to a mutant corn plant wherein the mutation causes at least a two-three fold increase in transgene RNA relative to the transgene in sibling or parental wild type plants and to seed and progeny plants derived from the mutant corn plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention is further directed to a process of producing a transgenic corn plant with an activated transgene comprising crossing a parental transgenic plant with a mutant plant wherein the parental transgenic plant has a transgene and the mutant plant is derived from a wild type corn plant. In the method, the mutant corn plant has one or more mutations that reduce the establishment or maintenance of paramutation in the mutant plant. In one format, the transgene in the parental transgenic plant is silenced and the mutation activates the silenced transgene. In another format, the transgene in the parental transgenic plant is activated and the mutation serves to prevent the transgene from being silenced in subsequent generations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the method of the invention a transgenic plant is produced where a silenced transgene is activated by the presence of a mutation or maintained active where the transgene is active in the parental line. The mutation reduces the establishment or maintenance of paramutation as compared to the wild type plant. In the method of the invention, the first progeny transgenic plant is outcrossed to a wild type corn plant to produce a second progeny transgenic plant wherein the silenced transgene remains activated in the second progeny transgenic plant but the second progeny transgenic plant is no longer reduced in the establishment or maintenance of paramutation as compared to the wild type plant because the mutation that originally activated the transgene is no longer present.

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The invention will be better understood by reference to drawings in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows phenotypes and crosses demonstrating paramutation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows seed phenotypes of r1 haplotypes. The top panels are the phenotypes of the parents, the paramutable, R-r haplotype or the paramutagenic R-st and R-mb haplotype. It does not matter which parent is used as male versus female. The central panel shows the phenotype of the F1 seeds. When these are planted and crossed as male to colorless recessive null r1alleles (not shown), the resulting seed phenotypes segregate (third panel). R-st and R-mb segregate unchanged. R-r is changed to a lower expressing form, R-r&prime;. Typically R-st is more paramutagenic than R-mb, as R-e is less pigmented when segregating from a R-st versus a R-mb F1. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows plant and anther phenotypes of b1 and pI1 alleles, respectively. Plant phenotypes of the parents are shown in the top panels, and the F1 in the left middle panels, directly below the parents. The progeny resulting from crosses of F1plants back to paramutable alleles are shown in the bottom panels. The only genotype that segregates is B&prime; or PI&prime;. The asterisk is used to indicate the newly paramutagenic allele, which is fully capable of altering a paramutable allele. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows structures of genes that undergo paramutation. Coding regions are indicated by black horizontal arrows. The coding and promoter regions are not to scale. Different promoter regions are indicated by distinct boxes. Promoter regions with sequence similarity are indicated by the same boxes: solid, striped or open. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows the structure of the r1 genes within paramutable, R-r:standard and R-d:Catspaw, and paramutagenic haplotypes, R-stippled and R-marbled. The doppia sequences are indicated by the open boxes. The distance between the r1 genes is not indicated. The approximate size and location of the transposable elements in R-st and R-mb are indicated by triangles. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows the structure of the b1 and pI1 alleles that undergo paramutation. The 3&prime; end of the transcribed region of pI1 is part of a repeat containing the 3&prime; flanking region. The location of the doppia related sequences in PI&prime; and PI-Rh is indicated by an open box. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>F show the phenotypes associated with the Mop1-1 mutation.

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference> show diagrams outlining tests for heritability of B&prime; and PI&prime; from homozygous Mop1-1 individuals.(A) If Mop1-1 heritably alters B&prime; to B-I, then B&prime;Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals would generate B-I Mop1-1 gametes and progeny would be dark plants. Alternatively, if B&prime; is still B&prime;, then all gametes would be B&prime; Mop1-1, B&prime; would paramutate B-I &lsqb;indicated by (B-I)&prime;&rsqb; in the next generation and all progeny would be light. (B) If Mop1-1heritably alters PI&prime; to Pl-Rh, then PI&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals would generate PI-Rh Mop1-1 gametes and progeny would have dark anthers. Alternatively, if PI&prime; is still PI&prime;, then all gametes would be PI&prime; Mop1-1, PI&prime; would paramutate PI-Rh &lsqb;indicated by (Pl-Rh)&prime;&rsqb; in the next generation and all progeny would have light anthers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows anther color scores (ACSs) of PI&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 outcrosses vs. PI&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 outcrosses. PI&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals versus PI&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 individuals were outcrossed to PI-Rh (Mop1/Mop1) testers. Individual progeny plants were scored for amount of anther pigment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the amounts of transcripts in Mop1-1 versus Wild-Type Siblings. An example of RNase protections for b1, pI1 and actin on four sibling individuals is shown. All individuals are homozygous B&prime; and PI&prime;, and segregating for Mop1-1 as indicated. The bar graph shows the normalized amounts of b1 (open bars) and pI1 (closed bars) RNA levels from the RNase protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C show transcription rates in mop1-1/mop1-1 versus Mop1-11mop1-1 siblings. (A) An example of an in vitro transcription assay showing the SK&plus; plasmid negative control and signal for b1, c2, and ubiquitin2 transcription in B&prime;Mop1-1/Mop1-1 versus B&prime;Mop1/Mop1-1 individuals. (B) Pair-wise data for b1 transcription rate from several in vitro transcription assays for several Mop1-1/Mop1-1 (closed bars) versus Mop1/Mop1-1 (open bars) individuals.

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a diagram showing three progeny classes from B/B-Peru Mop1/Mop1-1 self-pollinations. B&prime;Mop1-1 plants were crossed with B-Peru Mop1 plants. The light F1 B&prime;/B-Peru Mop1/Mop1-1 plants were self-pollinated, and purple kernels (B-Peru/&minus;) were planted. The progeny fell into three phenotypic classes; the numbers and genotypes of each phenotype are shown. The Mop1 genotype of the 24 B-Peru/B-Peru plants was determined by a testcross with B&prime; Mop1-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a diagram outlining a test for the ability of Mop1-1 to prevent b1paramutation. B&prime;/B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants were crossed to B-I/b Mop1/Mop1-1 plants, generating four types of segregating progeny. The B&prime;/B-I and B&prime;/b progeny were distinguished by restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The B&prime;/b progeny were not analyzed further. Both classes of B&prime;/B-I progeny (dark and light) were crossed with testers heterozygous for B-I/B-Peru, Mop1/Mop1 (and with testers null for b1, not diagrammed) to test whether the B-I allele heterozygous with B&prime; had become B&prime; in the Mop1-1/Mop1-1 versus Mop1/Mop1-1 plants. The expectations for crosses with B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 with one type of tester (B-Peru Mop1 which gives purple kernels) are shown. The expectation for the B&prime;/B-I Mop1/Mop1-1 progeny is that all offspring will be light plants (not diagrammed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B show a summary of Mop1-1 effects on r1 paramutation. (A) Parental genotypes and progeny classes used to evaluate the effect of Mop1-1 on the establishment of r1 paramutation. Mop1 genotypes were determined based upon the intensity of plant pigment within the PI/&minus; phenotypic class. Individuals belonging to the two R-d/&minus; genotypic classes indicated were identified by crossing to an R-g tester stock and the R-d/R-g kernel progeny were then assayed for pigment intensity. (B) The bar graph shows results of paramutation test with r1. Color scores for kernels inheriting the R-d allele are plotted from individuals having the parental genotype indicated along the x-axis. The first two columns are Mop1/&minus; genotype controls. Color score equals 100 minus average reflectometer reading as described (Alleman and Kermicle, 1993). Error bars indicate SD. </paragraph>

The fact that paramutation always occurs when B-I and B&prime; are heterozygous, and that this phenotype is apparent in all F1 individuals means that one can efficiently screen for dominant mutations that disrupt the establishment of paramutation. An exceptional dark plant was identified among numerous light siblings. This individual was found to carry a dominant mutation, referred to as Mop2-1. This original dark plant was outcrossed to gl2 B&prime; wt, and progeny of this cross were crossed to gi2 B-I wt. Following the marked chromosomes in these crosses demonstrate that this mutation is loosely linked to b1, mapping to the short arm of chromsome 2. </paragraph>

B&prime; individuals heterozygous for Mop2-1 were crossed to B-1 and progeny were scored for sheath and tassel pigment levels. A color score of 1-3 is typical of a B&prime; individual, and 6-7 is typical of a B-I individual. The distribution of color scores among progeny from nine B&prime; individuals heterozygous for the Mop2-1 mutation crossed to B-I are shown graphically.

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Maize (<highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>L.) is often referred to as corn in the United States. Maize, can be bred by both self-pollination and cross-pollination techniques. Maize has separate male and female flowers on the same plant, located on the tassel and the ear, respectively.

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Maize Nomenclature: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Maize nomenclature is the means to identify maize genes and alleles. A gene is designated with lower case italics (bl) in maize nomenclature &lsqb;See also Trends in Genetics &ldquo;Genetic Nomenclature Guide&rdquo; (1995) or the web site http://www.agron.missouri.edu/maize nomenclature.html&rsqb;. Specific alleles are indicated with an allele designation separated from the gene designation with a hyphen. Dominant alleles are indicated by an upper case gene designation (B-Peru) and recessive alleles by a lower case gene designation (b1-K55). Gene products are indicated by all caps and are not italicized (B). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Marker: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> A readily detectable phenotype or molecular or biochemical characteristic, preferably inherited in codominant fashion (both alleles at a locus in a diploid heterozygote are readily detectable), preferably with no environmental variance component, i.e., heritability of 1.

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Methylation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Process by which methyl groups are added to certain nucleotides in genomic DNA. Methyl sensitive restriction enzymes, such as SacI and HinfI cannot cut sequences with certain specific methylations. Methylation of DNA is often associated with reduced gene activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Mutant Corn Plant: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A plant that is homozygous for a recessive or dominant mutation in a particular gene or heterozygous for a dominant mutation in a particular gene. This mutation is usually associated with a change in the DNA sequence of the gene that is altered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Paramutation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A mitotically and meiotically heritable change in the transcriptional activity of a gene that can occur spontaneously or be induced by a paramutagenic allele. Paramutation is the change in gene activity of one allele due to its exposure to another allele. For example, at the b1 locus in maize, strong activity of the B-I allele confers dark purple pigmentation throughout the plant while weak activity of the B&prime; allele confers light pigment. In a B-I/B&prime; heterozygote, B-I is invariably changed to B&prime;; only B&prime; alleles segregate from the heterozygote (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The sensitive allele (B-I) is described as paramutable and the inducing allele (B) is described as paramutagenic. Similarly, with paramutation at pI1, PI-Rh is paramutable and PI&prime; is paramutagenic (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Establishment of Paramutation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The ability of a paramutagenic allele to change a paramutable allele into a paramutagenic allele. For example, when B&prime; is crossed with B-I, B-I is always changed to B, paramutation is always established when these two alleles are combined in a heterozygote. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Maintenance of Paramutation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The ability of a paramutant state (such as B) to be maintained. For example, when plants containing B&prime; or PI&prime; are grown, the low transcription level and the ability to be paramutagenic is maintained in those plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Heritable Maintenance of the Paramutant State: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The ability of a paramutant state (such as B&prime; or Pl) to be maintained in subsequent generations. When B&prime; or PI&prime; are sexually transmitted, the low transcription level and the ability to be paramutagenic is maintained in progeny plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Reduction in the Establishment of Paramutation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In wild type genetic backgrounds when B&prime; is crossed with B-I, when PI&prime; is crossed with Pl-Rh, or when R-st is crossed with R-d, paramutation always occurs, it is always established. For the b1 and r1loci over 100,000 different events at these two loci have been examined in the 50 years this has been studied. For pI1, several thousand events have been examined in the 10 years this has been studied. In the presence of certain mutations, paramutation is prevented. For example, in every plant that was homozygous for Mop1-1 (Example 1), the establishment of paramutation was completedly prevented; it was reduced by 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Reduction in the Maintenance of Paramutation: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> When B&prime; is in wild type genetic backgrounds, paramutation is always maintained: B&prime; always shows reduced transcription and strong paramutagenic activity. In the presence of certain mutations, such as mop1-1, the transcription rate and RNA levels of B&prime; are dramatically increased (Example 1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Reduction in the Heritable Maintenance of the Paramutant State: When PI&prime; is sexually transmitted from PI&prime; homozygotes in wild type genetic backgrounds, paramutation is always maintained: PI&prime; shows reduced transcription and strong paramutagenic activity. In certain mutant plants, the RNA levels from PI&prime; are increased, and in addition, nonparamutagenic pI1 alleles are sexually transmitted from homozygous P1 genotypes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Paramutagenic Alleles: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Paramutagenic alleles induce a change in sensitive, paramutable alleles. Examples include B&prime;, PI&prime; and R-st. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Paramutable Alleles: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Paramutable alleles are alleles that are sensitive to paramutagenic alleles. Examples include B-1, Pl-Rh, and R-d. Following paramutation, sensitive alleles are termed paramutant (or paramutated) and designated with an apostrophe (i.e., generically, B&prime;; PI&prime;; R&prime;, etc.) In the examples of b1 and pI1 paramutation, once the paramutable alleles becomed paramutated they are paramutagenic. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Repression of transgene activity via inhibited transcription and/or increased RNA degradation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Taking into account these definitions, the present invention relates to the isolation and characterization of corn mutants altered in the establishment or maintenance of paramutation, an example of gene silencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Screening System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Genetic and molecular studies of the <highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>L. corn (maize) b1 (booster 1) and pI1 (purple plant 1) loci are utilized in this invention to isolate new corn lines with reduced gene silencing activity. The b1 gene encodes a transcriptional regulator required for anthocyanin pigment synthesis. Two particular b1 alleles show strong allelic interactions that lead to heritable changes in b1 gene activity. Paramutated and non-paramutated phenotypes can be distinguished on the basis of seedling pigment (2-3 weeks old), immature plants and mature plants. The pI1 gene encodes a different transcriptional regulator also required for anthocyanin pigment synthesis. Two particular pI1 alleles show a strong allelic interaction that leads to heritable changes in pI1 gene activity. Paramutated and non-paramutated phenotypes can be distinguished on the basis of seedling pigment (14-18 days post-imbibition), mature plants and anthers of mature plants. The visual nature of the assay at an early growth stage and throughout development, and the non-essential nature of the anthocyanin pathway make it an excellent system for studying gene silencing. Most of the genes encoding both the specific biosynthetic enzymes and the transcriptional regulators have been cloned and sequenced. Pigment levels are a simple and sensitive indicator of quantitative changes in RNA accumulation of these transcriptional regulatory loci. The b1and r1 loci encode functionally duplicate basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and the pI1 and c1 loci encode functionally duplicate Myb-like transcription factors. Production of pigment co-requires the function of both a bHLH (b1 or r1) and a Myb (pI1 or c1) factor. Since alleles of all four loci have distinctive tissue-specific expression patterns, it is the specific combination of various alleles that determine whether or not pigment is produced in any given tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Paramutation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> All examples of paramutation involve an interaction between alleles that leads to a heritable reduction in the expression of one of the alleles. Alleles sensitive to altered expression are termed paramutable, and alleles inducing the change, paramutagenic. Following paramutation, sensitive alleles are termed paramutant (or paramutated) and designated with an apostrophe (i.e., generically, B&prime;, PI&prime;, R&prime; etc.). Many alleles at r1, b1 and pI1 do not participate in paramutation; these alleles have been referred to in the literature as either neutral or non-paramutagenic. Table 1 contains a summary of the loci, the paramutagenic and paramutable alleles and the tissues where paramutation is typically monitored at each locus.

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Paramutation Phenotypes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Paramutation was first studied with the paramutable R-rstandard (R-r:std) haplotype, which pigments seed and plant parts. In R-r:std, seed pigmentation is considerably more sensitive to paramutation than plant pigmentation (Brink and Mikula 1958), while in another paramutable haplotype that pigments both seed and plant parts, R-d:Catspaw (R-d), both seed and plant pigmentation levels are sensitive to paramutation (Brink et al., 1970). Haplotype is used to describe the particular r1 &ldquo;alleles&rdquo;, because all are complex containing multiple genes, resulting in the classic definition of allele being Baser inaccurate. In the most extensively studied r1 haplotypes, neither plant nor seed expression is markedly reduced in F1 plants (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). Consequently, silencing of paramutable r1haplotypes typically is monitored by crossing the F1 plants with null, recessive testers and analyzing kernel pigment levels in the progeny. The phenotype is strongest if the F1 is used as male. The fact that many, but not all, paramutable r1 haplotypes also undergo genomic imprinting (reflected in weaker pigment expressed in the endosperm if transmitted through the male) increases the sensitivity of this assay. Paramutagenic r1 haplotypes, R-sfippled (R-st) and R-marbled (R-mb), are expressed in seeds, although both alleles also are expressed in the scutellum and coleoptile tip. Seed phenotypes of parental, F1 and testcross progeny are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> for R-st, R-mb and R-r:std. At b1 and pI1 reduced expression is always seen in the F1 and the reduced expression is always transmitted to progeny (Coe, 1966; Hollick et al., 1995). The F1 plants typically have the phenotype of the paramutagenic B&prime; or PI&prime; alleles. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows the phenotypes of parental, F1 and progeny plants undergoing paramutation at b1 and pI1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Following meiosis, paramutant alleles retain the reduced expression state as discussed above and are themselves paramutagenic; they induce reduced expression of naive (not previously exposed to paramutagenic alleles) paramutable alleles in subsequent heterozygotes. At r1, a paramutable haplotype is changed into a weakly paramutagenic haplotype after it segregates from the paramutagenic haplotype. In the r1 literature, this is termed secondary paramutation to distinguish it from the stronger paramutagenicity seen with R-st and R-mb. After one generation of heterozygosity with R-st, the paramutagenicity of R-r:std&prime; is considerably weaker than the paramutagenicity of R-st (Brown and Brink, 1960). In contrast, at the b1 and pI1 loci, newly altered paramutagenic alleles (B&prime; or PI&prime;) are strongly paramutagenic. They induce heritable silencing (paramutagenicity) of paramutable alleles indistinguishably from the parental paramutagenic alleles (Coe, 1966; Hollick et al., 1995). This led Coe to describe the phenomenon at b1 as a conversion event (Coe, 1959). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Two assays are routinely used to monitor paramutation: 1) the ability of a paramutagenic allele to cause a heritable reduction in the expression of a paramutable allele; and 2) the heritable alteration of the paramutant allele into a paramutagenic allele. At b1 and pi1 these two phenotypes always occur simultaneously and completely. In contrast, at r1 the extent of paramutagenicity obtained by a paramutant haplotype depends on the circumstances of the crosses, as discussed in detail in Chandler, et al., (2000). Structures of paramutable and paramutagenic alleles </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Paramutagenic and paramutable r1 haplotypes share r1 coding sequences and parts of the promoter regions, but these coding and promoter regions are arranged in structurally distinct ways (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). The paramutagenic alleles at ri are readily distinguishable from the paramutable alleles; by these structural differences and by distinct expression patterns (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). The paramutable alleles R-r:std and R-d each contain inverted duplications of r1 coding regions (S1/S2 and D1/D2) flanking a region called Sigma. In R-r:std, Sigma is the seed-specific promoter for the S1 (seed1) and S2 (seed2) genes in R-r.std (Walker et al., 1995). Sigma in R-r:std contains rearranged pieces of sequences that have structural features common to transposable elements (these have been named doppia, and are indicated by open boxes in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) together with a small amount of sequence homologous to the P (plant) promoter (indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> as hatched areas; Walker et al., 1995). In R-d, Sigma contains only doppia-related sequences (R. Okagaki and J. Kermicle, Genbank U93178). The Sigma regions are located at the same sites relative to S2 and D2 in R-r:std and R-d, respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>), but some sequences of D1 are missing relative to SI (Walker et al., 1995; R. Okagaki and J. Kermicle, Genbank U93178), suggesting that the alleles may have arisen by independent events from a common progenitor. Additionally, R-r:std contains an r1 promoter region denoted q adjacent to a second doppia-related sequence between S1 and P. Ten kbp of sequence separates q from S1 and 190 kbp of sequence separate q and P (Robbins et al, 1991, Walker et al., 1995). In R-r:std, S1/S2 are expressed only in the seed, P in vegetative parts of the plant and q not at all since it is lacking an r1 coding region (Walker et al., 1995). The q sequences are structurally very similar to the P promoter region (Walker et al., 1995), and when linked to an r1 coding region by unequal crossing over, activate expression in the same plant parts as P (Dooner, 1979; J. Kermicle, M. Alleman and W. Eggleston, unpublished data). In R-d, D1/D2 are expressed in both plant and seed (Bray and Brink, 1966; R. Okagaki and J. Kermicle, personal communication). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Both well-studied paramutagenic haplotypes contain multiple r1 genes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) with distinct patterns of expression. The paramutagenic haplotype R-st contains four r1genes in direct orientation (Eggleston et al., 1995). Three distinct r1 genes were cloned from the R-mb haplotype (Panavas et al., 1999). Quantitative analysis of the products of unequal recombination of R-mb demonstrates that this haplotype contains the three cloned r1 genes organized in direct repeats (Neal, 1998; M. Alleman, personal communication) as inferred by Panavas et al., (1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The Sc (self color) and Scm (self color marbled) genes in R-st and R-mb, respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>), pigment the aleurone, scutellum and tip of the coleoptile in dried seeds, although Scm has much higher scutellurn and coleoptile pigment than does Sc (A. Eggleston, M. Alleman, J. Kermicle and W. Eggleston, unpublished data). Scm but not Sc also pigments the scutellar node of germinating seeds (A. Eggleston, M. Alleman and W. Eggleston, unpublished data). The I-R transposable element within Sc, and the Shooter element within Scm, cause the stippled and marbled phenotypes, respectively (Eggleston et al., 1995; Panavas et al., 1999). Full purple color is observed when the elements are lost by excision, gene conversion or unequal crossing over. The full color haplotypes are referred to as R-sc and R-scm. Neither I-R nor Shooter significantly contributes to paramutagenicity; losses of I-R from R-st and Shooter from R-mb by excision or gene conversion events that maintain the number of r1 genes have no effect on paramutagenicity (Kermicle et al., 1995; Quinn, 1999; J. Kermicle and W. Eggleston, unpublished data). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In addition to the highly expressed Sc and Scm genes, both R-st and R-mb contain additional r1 genes with distinct expression patterns. The Nc (near colorless) genes in R-st (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) are weakly expressed in the aleurone of seeds (Eggleston et al., 1995). The Lcm (Lc-like marbled) genes in R-mb do not contain functional promoters as they are not expressed in any tissue unless linked to a different, active promoter. Intriguingly, each Nc gene in R-st contains a doppia sequence in the promoter-proximal region in the same relative orientation and position as the doppia sequences in Sigma adjacent to S2 and D2 in R-r:std and R-d (W. Eggleston, unpublished data; Matzke et al., 1996). However, the doppia sequences are unlikely to be necessary for paramutagenicity as the Lcm genes in R-mb do not contain doppia or Sigma sequences in their promoter proximal regions (Panavas et al., 1999; J. Kermicle and W. Eggleston, unpublished data). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In contrast to r1, where paramutable and strongly paramutagenic haplotypes are structurally distinct, the b1 and pI1 paramutagenic alleles arose through spontaneous changes of paramutable to paramutagenic alleles. Extensive restriction map analyses comparing the paramutable and paramutagenic forms of these alleles have identified no distinguishing differences (DNA insertions, deletions or other rearrangements) between the two types. The regions examined include &minus;25 kbp spanning the 4 kbp be coding region (Patterson et al., 1993) and &minus;10 kbp spanning the 1 kbp pI1 coding region. The structures of these alleles are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. In pI1 there is a region of 290 bp that shares sequence similarity with doppia, located upstream of the transcription initiation site. However, this sequence is not sufficient for pI1 paramutation as it is found in non-paramutagenic alleles as well (reviewed in Hollick et al., 1997). No doppia sequences have been detected in any b1 allele (V. Chandler, unpublished data). Paramutation can occur spontaneously </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Paramutable alleles of all three loci, B-I, Pl-Rh, and R-r:std, are inherently unstable, as they change to lower expression states even in the absence of paramutagenic alleles. However, whether the reduced expression correlates with the simultaneous acquisition of paramutagenicity differs significantly among the loci. At b1, spontaneous changes of B-1 to B&prime; occur at high frequencies (often 1-10%), and are readily detected as lightly colored sectors within a B-1 plant or lightly pigmented B&prime; progeny arising from homozygous B-1 plants (Coe, 1966). Spontaneously derived B&prime; alleles are as fully paramutagenic as B&prime; alleles segregating from B&prime;lB-1 plants. Thus, the lower expression state associated with B&prime; is invariably associated with strong paramutagenicity that results in paramutation when crossed with paramutable alleles (Coe, 1966). At pI1 spontaneous changes of PI-Rh to PI&prime; also occur at high frequencies, but there is variation in the expression levels and paramutagenic strength of the spontaneous derivatives (Hollick et al., 1995). Alleles with the most reduction in expression are strongly paramutagenic, while alleles with intermediate expression are weakly paramutagenic (Hollick et al., 1995; Hollick et al., 2000). Spontaneous changes to lower gene expression states do occur with paramutable r1 alleles, but these states are not heritable nor are they associated with acquisition of strong paramutagenicity (Brink et al., 1968). Expression levels are influenced by allele interactions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The stability of the expression states differs for the b1, pI1 and r1 loci. The paramutable B-J allele is extremely unstable when homozygous, changing into B&prime; at very high frequencies, whereas when B-I is heterozygous with alleles that do not participate in paramutation it is much more stable (Coe, 1966; V. Chandler and K. Kubo, unpublished data). The paramutant, now paramutagenic allele, B&prime;, is very stable as it has not been found to change back to a highly expressed, paramutable form in standard maize stocks (Coe, 1966; Patterson et al., 1995), independent of whether it is carried homozygous or heterozygous with other alleles. In contrast to the stability of B&prime;, paramutant PI&prime; and R&prime; are metastable. Their expression states fall within a wide continuum of levels in subsequent generations. The frequency and direction of changes depend on whether they are maintained as homozygotes or heterozygotes and the nature of the other allele, as reviewed in Chandler et al. 2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Paramutation Occurs in Somatic Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The light color phenotype and low levels of b1 or pI1 RNA in F1 individuals containing paramutagenic and paramutable alleles, combined with the spontaneous change from B-1 to B&prime; or PI-Rh to PI&prime; in somatic cells, suggest b1 and pI1 paramutation occurs in somatic cells (reviewed in Chandler et al., 1996). Several lines of evidence also suggest that paramutation at r1 occurs somatically. Sastry et al. (1965) showed that individual tassel branches of a single plant transmitted distinct expression states, demonstrating somatic sectors. Treatment of F1 seeds with irradiation (Shih and Brink, 1969) or alkylating agents (Axtell and Brink, 1967; Brink et al., 1968) results in significant reductions in paramutation. Further, r1 paramutation is significantly impacted by altering the environmental conditions of young F1 seedlings at times well before meiosis (Mikula, 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Genetic Strategies to Identify Trans-Acting Components Required for Paramutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> To understand the underlying mechanisms that control paramutation, an example of gene silencing, it will be essential to identify the molecular machinery responsible for the establishment and maintanence of paramutation. This invention is directed to the use of several mutational approaches to identify trans acting components required for paramutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Mutations were isolated from several distinct genetic screens (described below) designed to identify mutations that cause increase pigment production in B&prime;/B&prime; and/or PI&prime;/PI&prime; plants. Mutations identified in screens using the B&prime;/B&prime; system are designated mop mutations for mediator of paramutation and those identified in screens using PI&prime;/PI&prime; materials are designated rmr mutations for required to maintain repression. There are at least two putative functions for the mop and rmr gene products; 1) they could be required to establish paramutation, 2) they could be required to maintain gene repression previously established by paramutation. The genes could also be required for both establishment and maintenance of paramutation. In addition, rmr and mop gene products could either be required to maintain repressed gene expression only during somatic development or they could be required to ensure that the repressed expression state is also transferred to progeny (maintained through meiosis, gametophyte development, fertilization and embryo development). Distinctive seedling and plant pigment phenotypes facilitate genetic screens for mutations that alter either the establishment or the maintenance of paramutation. Screens have been developed using either the b1 (Example 1) or the pI1 system (Example 3). Both transposon (Example 1) and EMS mutagenesis (Example 3, 6) have been utilized. The extreme penetrance of b1 and pI1 paramutation (it always occurs) together with the stability of the paramutant state at both loci make these powerful screens. The basic approach is to mutagenize the parent containing the paramutagenic allele, cross to the paramutable allele, and then screen the resulting M1 generation for rare dominant mutants that prevent the establishment of paramutation. These are identified as rare dark seedlings or plants among lightly pigmented siblings. To screen for recessive mutations that fail to maintain the reduced expression state associated with paramutation, M1 plants are self-pollinated and the resulting M2 are screened for darkly pigmented seedlings or plants. The background for the b1 screen is extremely low, as the only two dark exceptions in the approximately 10,000 M1 B&prime;/B-I plants screened were subsequently shown to be dominant or semi-dominant mutants. The background with the pI1 screen is higher, as the examination of approximately 50,000 M1 individuals, revealed 0.2% dark seedlings that when grown to maturity had light PI&prime; anthers, so were not true mutants. To date 16 independent mutations have been identified that relieve the gene silencing associated with the paramutant state (described in detail in Examples below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Phenotypes of Corn Mutants with Reduced Gene Silencing Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Several methods have been used to characterize the various mutant alleles isolated from these genetic screens. 1) Genetic complementation tests establish potential allelism (determines the number of unique genes identified) and reveal potential genetic interactions between different genes. 2) RNA levels of B&prime;, PI&prime; or both, are determined in the mutants and compared to wild type siblings. 3) The relative impact each mutation has on maintaining the silenced expression state of B&prime;, PI&prime; or both, is determined by monitoring the stability of the reduced expression state in progeny from outcrosses. 4) Genetic experiments are done to assess the ability of the mutations to prevent the establishment of paramutation at b1, r1 and pI1.5) Phenotypic analysis compares the relative impact each mutation has on normal maize plant growth and development. 6) The ability of the mutants to affect other epigenetic phenomena such as transposon methylation and transgene silencing is tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Plant Breeding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The goal of field crop breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single variety/hybrid. The reduced gene silencing traits of the mutant corn lines of the present invention can be introduced into corn breeding programs in order to prevent the establishment or maintenance of gene silencing in new corn lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Breeding techniques take advantage of a plant&apos;s method of pollination. There are two general methods of pollination: a plant self-pollinates if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. A plant cross-pollinates if pollen comes to it from a flower on a different plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Corn plants (<highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>L.) can be bred by both self-pollination and cross-pollination. Both types of pollination involve the corn plant&apos;s flowers. Corn has separate male and female flowers on the same plant, located on the tassel and the ear, respectively. Natural pollination occurs in corn when wind blows pollen from the tassels to the silks that protrude from the tops of the ear shoot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Plants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type over many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny, a homozygous plant. Here, the mutant plants of the invention have been selfed and selected for the absence of gene silencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> A cross between two homozygous plants produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that are heterozygous for many gene loci. Conversely, a cross of two plants each heterozygous at a number of loci produces a population of hybrid plants that differ genetically and are not uniform. The resulting non-uniformity makes performance unpredictable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The development of uniform corn plant hybrids requires the development of homozygous inbred plants, the crossing of these inbred plants, and the evaluation of the crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection are examples of breeding methods used to develop inbred plants from breeding populations. Those breeding methods combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred plants such as the mutant plants of this invention or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred plants are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes. The new inbreds are crossed with other inbred plants and the hybrids from these crosses are evaluated to determine which of those have commercial potential. Pedigree Breeding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The pedigree breeding method involves crossing two genotypes. In this invention, one genotype would be a mutant corn plant of the invention. Each genotype can have one or more desirable characteristics lacking in the other; or, each genotype can complement the other. If the two original parental genotypes do not provide all of the desired characteristics, other genotypes can be included in the breeding population. Superior plants that are the products of these crosses are selfed and selected in successive generations. Each succeeding generation becomes more homogeneous as a result of self-pollination and selection. Typically, this method of breeding involves five or more generations of selfing and selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Backcrossing can also be used to improve an inbred plant. Backcrossing transfers a specific desirable trait from one inbred or non-inbred source to an inbred that lacks that trait. In this invention, the reduced gene silencing activity trait of the corn lines of the invention can be transferred to another corn line. This can be accomplished, for example, by first crossing a superior inbred (A) (recurrent parent) to a donor inbred (non-recurrent parent), which carries the appropriate locus or loci for the trait in question. In the present invention, the mutants of the invention would serve as the donor stock either in inbred or non-inbred genetic backgrounds. The progeny of this cross are then mated back to the superior recurrent parent (A) followed by selection in the resultant progeny for the desired trait to be transferred from the non-recurrent parent. After five or more backcross generations with selection for the desired trait, the progeny are heterozygous for loci controlling the characteristic being transferred, but are like the superior parent for most or almost all other loci. The last backcross generation would be selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the trait being transferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> A single cross hybrid corn variety is the cross of two inbred plants, each of which has a genotype that complements the genotype of the other. The hybrid progeny of the first generation is designated F1. Typically, F1 hybrids are more vigorous than their inbred parents. This hybrid vigor, or heterosis, is manifested in many polygenic traits, including markedly improved yields, better stalks, better roots, better uniformity and better insect and disease resistance. In the development of hybrids only the F1 hybrid plants are typically sought. An F1 single cross hybrid is produced when two inbred plants are crossed. A double cross hybrid is produced from four inbred plants crossed in pairs (A&times;B and C&times;D) and then the two F1 hybrids are crossed again (A&times;B)&times;(C&times;D). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> Development of F1 Lines </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The development of a hybrid corn variety generally involves three steps: (1) the selection of plants from various germplasm pools such as the mutant corn plants of the invention; (2) the selfing of the selected plants for several generations to produce a series of inbred plants, which, although different from each other, each breed true and are highly uniform; and (3) crossing the selected inbred plants with unrelated inbred plants to produce the hybrid progeny (F1). During the inbreeding process in corn, the vigor of the plants decreases. Vigor is restored when two unrelated inbred plants are crossed to produce the hybrid progeny (F1). An important consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred plants is that the hybrid between any two inbreds is always the same. Once the inbreds that give a superior hybrid have been identified, hybrid seed can be reproduced indefinitely as long as the homogeneity of the inbred parents is maintained. Conversely, much of the hybrid vigor exhibited by F1 hybrids is lost in the next generation (F2). Consequently, seed from hybrid varieties is not used for planting stock. It is not generally beneficial for farmers to save seed from F1 hybrids. Rather, farmers purchase F1 hybrid seed for planting every year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> In selecting a second plant to cross with the mutant corn plants of the invention for the purpose of developing novel inbred lines, it will typically be desired to choose those plants which either themselves exhibit one or more selected desirable characteristics or which exhibit the desired characteristic(s) when in hybrid combination. Examples of potentially desired characteristics include greater yield, better stalks, better roots, resistance to insecticides, herbicides, pests, and disease, tolerance to heat and drought, reduced time to crop maturity, better agronomic quality, higher nutritional value, and uniformity in germination times, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and fruit size. Alternatively, the mutant corn plants of the invention may be crossed with a second, different inbred plant for the purpose of producing hybrid seed that is sold to farmers for planting in commercial production fields. In this case, a second inbred variety is selected which confers desirable characteristics when in hybrid combination with the first inbred line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, crossing comprises the steps of: (a) planting in pollinating proximity seeds of a first and a second parent corn plant, and preferably, seeds of a first inbred corn plant and a second, distinct inbred corn plant; (b) cultivating or growing the seeds of the first and second parent corn plants into plants that bear flowers; (c) emasculating flowers of either the first or second parent corn plant, i.e., treating the flowers so as to prevent pollen production, or alternatively, using as the female parent a male sterile plant, thereby providing an emasculated parent corn plant; (d) allowing natural cross-pollination to occur between the first and second parent corn plants; (e) harvesting seeds produced on the emasculated parent corn plant; and, (f) growing the harvested seed into a corn plant, preferably, a hybrid corn plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Parental plants are typically planted in pollinating proximity to each other by planting the parental plants in alternating rows, in blocks or in any other convenient planting pattern. Where the parental plants differ in timing of sexual maturity, it may be desired to plant the slower maturing plant first, thereby ensuring the availability of pollen from the male parent during the time at which silks on the female parent are receptive to pollen. Plants of both parental parents are cultivated and allowed to grow until the time of flowering. Advantageously, during this growth stage, plants are in general treated with fertilizer and/or other agricultural chemicals as considered appropriate by the grower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> At the time of flowering, in the event that the mutant plants of the invention are employed as the male parent, the tassels of the other parental plant are removed from all e plants employed as the female parental plant to avoid self-pollination. The detasseling can be achieved manually but also can be done by machine, if desired. Alternatively, when the female parent corn plant comprises a cytoplasmic or nuclear gene conferring male sterility, detasseling may not be required. Additionally, a chemical gametocide may be used to sterilize the male flowers of the female plant. In this case, the parent plants used as the male may either not be treated with the chemical agent or may comprise a genetic factor which causes resistance to the emasculating effects of the chemical agent. Gametocides affect processes or cells involved in the development, maturation or release of pollen. Plants treated with such gametocides are rendered male sterile, but typically remain female fertile. The use of chemical gametocides is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,936,904, the disclosure of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Furthermore, the use of ROUNDUP&square; herbicide in combination with glyphosate tolerant maize plants to produce male sterile corn plants is disclosed in PCT Publication WO 98/44140. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Following emasculation, the plants are then typically allowed to continue to grow and natural cross-pollination occurs as a result of the action of wind, which is normal in the pollination of grasses, including corn. As a result of the emasculation of the female parent plant, only the pollen from the male parent plant is available for pollination because tassels, and thereby pollen bearing flowering parts, have been previously removed from all plants of the inbred plant being used as the female in the hybridization. Of course, during this hybridization procedure, the parental varieties are grown such that they are isolated from other corn fields to minimize or prevent any accidental contamination of pollen from foreign sources. These isolation techniques are well within the skill of those skilled in this art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Both parental inbred plants of corn may be allowed to continue to grow until maturity or the male rows may be destroyed after flowering is complete. Only the ears from the female inbred parental plants are harvested to obtain seeds of a novel F1 hybrid. The novel F1 hybrid seed produced can then be planted in a subsequent growing season in commercial fields or, alternatively, advanced in breeding protocols for purposes of developing novel inbred lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the mutant corn lines of the present invention can be used as inbred lines. It is more likely, however, that the mutant lines of this invention will be used in breeding programs to introduce the gene silencing repression traits into other lines. The gene silencing repression traits may be introduced into other lines by the use of single locus conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Single Locus Conversions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> When the term inbred corn plant is used in the context of the present invention, this also includes any single locus conversions of that inbred. The term single locus converted plant as used herein refers to those corn plants that are developed by a plant breeding technique called backcrossing wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of an inbred are recovered in addition to the single locus transferred into the inbred via the backcrossing technique. Backcrossing methods can be used with the present invention to improve or introduce a characteristic such as reduced gene silencing activity into the inbred. The term backcrossing as used herein refers to the repeated crossing of a hybrid progeny back to one of the parental corn plants for that inbred. The parental corn plant that contributes the locus or loci for the desired characteristic is termed the nonrecurrent or donor parent. This terminology refers to the fact that the nonrecurrent parent is used one time in the backcross protocol and therefore does not recur. The parental corn plant to which the locus or loci from the nonrecurrent parent are transferred is known as the recurrent parent as it is used for several rounds in the backcrossing protocol. In a typical backcross protocol, the original inbred of interest (recurrent parent) is crossed to a second nonrecurrent parent stock (inbred or otherwise) that carries the single locus of interest to be transferred. The resulting progeny from this cross are then crossed again to the recurrent parent and the process is repeated until a corn plant is obtained wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of the recurrent parent are recovered in the converted plant, in addition to the single transferred locus from the nonrecurrent parent. The backcross process may be accelerated by the use of molecular markers, such as RFLP, SSLP, SNP or AFLP markers to identify plants with the greatest genetic complement from the recurrent parent, but retaining the single locus of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The goal of a backcross protocol is to alter or substitute a single trait or characteristic such as repression of gene silencing or reduced gene silencing activity in the original inbred. To accomplish this, a single locus of the recurrent inbred is modified or substituted with the desired locus from the nonrecurrent parent, while retaining essentially all of the rest of the desired genetic, and therefore the desired physiological and morphological constitution of the original inbred. Here, the mutants with reduced gene silencing can be used as the nonrecurrent parent. The exact backcrossing protocol will depend on the characteristic or trait being altered to determine an appropriate testing protocol. Although backcrossing methods are simplified when the characteristic being transferred is a dominant allele, a recessive allele may also be transferred. In this instance it may be necessary to introduce a test of the progeny to determine if the desired characteristic has been successfully transferred. It may also be possible to follow transfer of the allele with reduced gene silencing properties using tightly linked molecular markers, such as SSLP or RFLP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Tissue Cultures and in Vitro Regeneration of Corn Plants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the invention relates to tissue cultures of the mutant corn plants of the invention. As used herein, the term &ldquo;tissue culture&rdquo; indicates a composition comprising isolated cells of the same or a different type or a collection of such cells organized into parts of a plant. Exemplary types of tissue cultures are protoplasts, calli and plant cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants, such as embryos, pollen, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, leaves, husks, stalks, roots, root tips, anthers, silk, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the tissue culture comprises embryos, protoplasts, meristematic cells, pollen, leaves or anthers derived from immature tissues of these plant parts. Means for preparing and maintaining plant tissue cultures are well known in the art (U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,880; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,550,318, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). By way of example, a tissue culture comprising organs such as tassels or anthers has been used to produce regenerated plants (U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,961 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,789; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Tassel/Anther Culture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Tassels contain anthers that in turn enclose microspores. Microspores develop into pollen. For anther/microspore culture, if tassels are the plant composition, they are preferably selected at a stage when the microspores are uninucleate, that is, include only one, rather than 2 or 4 nuclei. Methods to determine the correct stage are well known to those skilled in the art and include mitramycin fluorescent staining, trypan blue and acetocarmine squashing. The mid-uninucleate microspore stage has been found to be the developmental stage most responsive to the subsequent methods disclosed to ultimately produce plants. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The mutant corn lines of the invention may be crossed with any other suitable corn plants. Such suitable corn plants generally include commercially useful traits. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> General. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Paramutation is an interaction between two specific alleles, which leads to a heritable alteration in one of the alleles at a very high frequency. Paramutation was first described at the r1 locus of maize (Brink, 1956; Brink, 1958). Brink observed that aleurone pigment levels in genotypically identical kernels (triploid endosperm R-r/R-g/R-g) were significantly different, dependent upon whether R-r was previously homozygous or heterozygous with R-stippled (R-st). R-st (termed paramutagenic) induced a heritable reduction in the expression of standard R-r (termed paramutable); altered R-r is designated R-r&prime; (reviewed in Kermicle, 1996). The paramutable b1 and pI1 alleles are B-I and Pl-Rh respectively, and when heterozygous with a paramutagenic B&prime; or PI&prime; allele, the paramutable allele is heritably changed into a paramutagenic allele (Coe, 1966; Hollick et al., 1995). The paramutable B-I and PI-Rh alleles are also unstable, spontaneously changing to B&prime; and PI&prime; (Coe, 1966; Hollick et al., 1995). Most alleles of b1, r1 and pI1 do not participate in paramutation and are termed neutral. Paramutation-like phenomena are not restricted to pigment regulatory genes; they have also been described in other plants (reviewed in Brink, 1973), and with transgenes in Petunia and tobacco (Meyer et al., 1993; Matzke et al., 1994; reviewed in Hollick et al., 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Paramutation has been extensively characterized at three maize loci: r1, b1, and pI1 (For review see Chandler et al., 2000). b1 and r1 encode functionally interchangeable basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors (Styles et al., 1973; Ludwig et al., 1989; Goff et al., 1990; Radicella et al., 1991), whereas pI1 encodes a myb-related transcription factor (Cone et al., 1993). Activation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway requires co-expression of a bHLH factor and a myb-related factor (Goff et al., 1992). In general, the pI1 locus is expressed in the plant, whereas its functional equivalent, c1, is expressed in the embryo and the aleurone layer of the kernel endosperm. Therefore, when functional alleles of p/1 and c1 are present, it is generally the b1 and r1 alleles present that determine the tissue-specific patterns of anthocyanin expression (Styles et al., 1973). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> Plant Stocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> All plant stocks contained dominant functional alleles for all the genes encoding the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes required in vegetative plant tissues. Because transcription of these genes in vegetative plant tissues is controlled by pI1 in combination with b1 or r1, the specific b1, pI1 and r1 alleles are indicated for relevant stocks. One exception is the distinction between PI&prime;-mahogany (PI&prime;) and Pl-Rhoades (Pl-Rh) (Hollick et al., 1995). Many stocks possess the R-g allele of r1 (no expression in the seed or plant), which precludes reliable scoring of PI&prime; versus Pl-Rh. In these stocks, we have used P/to indicate the presence of either Pl-Rh, or its spontaneous derivative PI&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Though stocks containing various b1 alleles have been maintained in the laboratory of Vicki Chandler (now at the University of Arizona) for several years, they were originally obtained from a variety of sources: B-1 PIR-g (inbred W23 background), B&prime; PIR-g (inbred K55 background), and b1-K55 PIR-g (inbred K55 background) stocks from E. H. Coe, Jr. (University of Missouri, Columbia), B-bar from E. D. Styles (University of Victoria), and B-Peru (inbred W22 background) from G. Neuffer (University of Missouri). Jay Hollick and Vicki Chandler have maintained PI-Rh and PI&prime;-mahogany stocks originally obtained from E. H. Coe, Jr. and additional PI-Rh stocks from the Maize Cooperation Stock Center. J. L. Kermicle has maintained the R-stippled (R-st), R-r:standard (R-r:std, a specific accession of R-r, also known as standard R-r), and R-d:Catspaw (R-d) stocks (each containing B-bar and pI-W22, inbred W22 background) established by R. A. Brink and colleagues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Genetic Screen. A B-I PIR-g stock was used to generate a B-I PIR-g Mu stock by sequential backcrosses into active Mutator stocks (Patterson et al., 1991). The B-I PIR-g Mu stock, carrying functional alleles for all of the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes, was crossed to B&prime; PIR-g (inbred W23 background). The B&prime; allele in this stock was a spontaneous derivative of the B-I allele obtained from E. H. Coe, Jr. F1 individuals between B&prime; and B-I Mu were self-pollinated to generate F2 families. F2 families were screened in sand benches for rare darkly-pigmented seedlings resembling B-1-like plants among siblings that were essentially green. The mediator of paramutation1-1 (Mop1-1) mutation was isolated from this screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Genetic Crosses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In the crosses that follow, a single allele listing indicates homozygosity, whereas heterozygous individuals are indicated with alleles separated by a slash (/). In some instances, the identity of one (dominant) allele is known, but the second allele could be either of two possibilities (e.g. B&prime;l-). The term &ldquo;family&rdquo; refers to plants grown from kernels on the same ear, all of which share a common tassel parent. To characterize homozygous Mop1-1 plants relative to heterozygous siblings, families segregating Mop1-1 were generated as follows: B&prime; PIR-g Mop1-1 plants were crossed to B&prime; PIR-g Mop1, and the resulting F1 plants backcrossed to B&prime; PIR-g Mop1-1 plants. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons between Mop1-1/Mop1-1 and Mop1/Mop1-1 siblings derive from families generated in this way. One exception is the individuals used to assay the methylation levels of repeated sequences. The sibling individuals compared in this experiment derived from a backcross of B&prime;/b1-A188 PI/pI-sr R-r/R-g Mop1/Mop1-1 with homozygous B&prime;PIR-g Mop1-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> To test whether Mop1-1 affects the paramutant PI&prime; allele, B&prime; PIR-g Mop1-1 plants were crossed to a b1-W23 PI&prime; R-r stock, and F1 individuals were self-pollinated. Additional segregating families were generated by intercrossing light- and dark-anthered siblings. The inheritance of PI&prime; was assayed from four Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals derived directly from the self-pollinated F1 individuals. Additional tests were done using individuals from segregating families derived from PI&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 crossed by PI&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1. Tests from these families totaled seven PI&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 and three PI&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 individuals. The inheritance of PI&prime; was tested by crosses with a variety of PI-Rh tester stocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> To test whether Mop1-1 influences the expression of other b1 alleles, B&prime; PIR-g Mop1-1 plants were crossed to a B-Peru PIR-g Mop1 stock (inbred W22 background), and the F1 plants were self-pollinated. Purple kernels were planted (B-Peru/&minus;), and homozygous B-Peru individuals produced ears with 100% purple kernels. All F2 individuals were testcrossed with B&prime; PIR-g Mop1-1 to determine the Mop1 genotype. B-bar stocks were derived as follows: B-bar pI-W22 R-r Mop1 (inbred W22 background) were crossed with B&prime; PIR-g Mop1-1; the F1 was self-pollinated; dark progeny (B&prime;/&minus; Mop1-1/Mop1-1) were backcrossed with B-bar pi-W22 R-r Mop1; progeny of the backcross were self-pollinated; and dark progeny were self-pollinated again. The phenotypes of progeny from the last self-pollinations were used to discern whether Mop1-1 intensifies B-bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> To test whether Mop1-1 has an effect on the establishment of b1 paramutation, Mop1-1 was crossed to b1-K55 PIR-g to facilitate further genetic analyses in a background independent of B&prime;. This b1-K55 Mop1 stock was used to introduce the Mop1-1 allele into B-I stocks to test for an effect of Mop1-1 on the establishment of b1 paramutation. Three B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals were tested with one cross each to B-I/B-Peru PIR-g Mop1 stocks and with crosses to b1 tester stocks (total of four families to either b1-K551b1-K55 or b1-K551b1-W23 PIR-g Mop1/Mop1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> To test for an effect of Mop1-1 on the establishment of pI1 paramutation, B&prime; Pl-Rh R-r/-Mop1/Mop1-1 was crossed with B&prime;/-PI&prime;R-r/-Mop1/Mop1-1; and darkly-pigmented progeny (B&prime;/&minus; PI&prime;PI-Rh R-r/-Mop1-1/Mop1-1) were crossed with b1-K55 PI-Rh R-r Mop1. A total of four families representing three PI&prime;/PI-Rh Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals were examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> To test effects of Mop1-1 on the establishment of r1 paramutation, B&prime; PIR-g Mop1-1 plants were crossed to R-st and R-d. Intercrosses between the resulting R-st and R-d progenies produced paramutagenic R-d R-st and non-paramutagenic R-d R-g heterozygotes for comparison among Mop1-1/Mop1-1 and Mop1/&minus; classes. Because Mop1-1 does not intensify B-bar pigmentation, one in 13 plants classified as Mop1/&minus; (light plant) is expected to be B-bar/B-bar Mop1-1/Mop1-1. Reduced paramutation in this genotype would underestimate paramutation in the control population and thus underestimate the ability of Mop1-1 to inhibit r1 paramutation. Effects on r1 paramutation were assayed with testcrosses to W23 R-g stocks (null for both aleurone and plant expression of r1) followed by measurement of kernel color using a reflectometer (Alleman and Kermicle, 1993). A similar crossing scheme was used to test effects of Mop1-1 on the paramutable R-r:std haplotype. R-r:std, also known as standard R-r, indicates that this is the specific R-r accession originally tested by Brink (1956). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> RNA levels were assayed by RNase protections using actin or ubiquitin as an internal control. RNA was isolated using Trizol (Gibco/BRL) according to manufacturer&apos;s directions, with the exception that tissue was ground using liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle. RNase protections were performed as described in Selinger and Chandler (1999). 5 &mgr;g total RNA was used per hybridization. The actin 1 probe (5&prime; half of exon 2), the 315 bp cDNA probe from b1, and the 438 bp cDNA probe from c2 were as described previously (Selinger and Chandler, 1999). The ubiquitin probe is a 228 bp BgIII fragment from ubi2 (Christensen et al., 1992) which encompasses one of the seven ubiquitin repeats. The pI1 probe is a 505 bp cDNA fragment which includes exons 1-2 and ends at the BgII site in exon 3 of the PI-Rh allele. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Transcription rates were determined using in vitro transcription assays on isolated nuclei. Nuclei were isolated by two independent procedures. The first method, using a hexylene glycol-based buffer and percoll for differential density purification, was based primarily upon a maize nuclei isolation protocol (Cone et al., 1993) with modifications incorporated (B. J. Janssen, personal communication) after consulting several additional sources (Spiker et al., 1983; Watson and Thompson, 1986; Paul et al., 1987; Lund et al., 1995). Leaf sheath tissue, harvested from plants approximately two weeks prior to tassel emergence, was ground with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and suspended in 160 ml nuclear extraction buffer at 4&deg; C. (Cone et al., 1993). After filtration through two layers of cheesecloth, 1.6 ml of 25% Triton X-100 was slowly added to each sample, followed by filtration through a 53 &mgr;m nylon sheet. After filtering, samples were centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor (10 min 4&deg; C. 1000 g). Nuclei were resuspended in 20 ml working buffer (Cone et al., 1993) modified to contain 0.25% Triton X-100 and layered on top of 90% percoll (Cone et al., 1993) modified to contain 0.25% Triton X-100 and 10 mM MgCl2. Samples were centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor (20 min. 4&deg; C. 4000 g). Nuclei were recovered from the top of the 90% percoll, diluted 3-fold in nuclei wash buffer (10 mM PIPES (Piperazine-N,N&prime;-bis&lsqb;2-ethanesulfonic acid&rsqb;) pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) and pelleted (15 min 4&deg; C. 2000 g). Supernatant was decanted and nuclei were resuspended in resuspension buffer modified to contain 20% glycerol (Hollick and Gordon, 1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In the second method, nuclei from 7-10 grams of sheath and husk tissue from plants at anthesis was prepared using a chromatin isolation protocol (Steinmuller and Apel, 1986) with the following changes: Ground material was suspended in 15 ml isolation buffer (Steinmuller and Apel, 1986) filtered through two layers of cheesecloth followed by a 53 &mgr;m nylon sheet. Three centrifugations were performed (15 min &minus;10&deg; C. 6000 g). Following the first two centrifugations, crude nuclei pellets were resuspended in 15 ml isolation buffer. After the last centrifugation, crude nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml of the resuspension buffer described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Nuclei isolated by either method were repelleted (30 sec RT 5000 rpm using Eppendorf micro-centrifuge) and resuspended in 0.1 ml of resuspension buffer (described above). Reactions and RNA isolations were carried out as described in Hollick and Gordon (1993) with the exception that 100 &mgr;Ci alpha-32p-CTP (800 Ci/mmole) was used and incubation was at 30&deg; C. for 25 minutes. Comparable amounts of labelled RNA for each genotype were used for filter hybridization. </paragraph>

Ubiquitin, &tilde;975 bp Pstl fragment of ubi2 from plasmid ca210 (Christensen et al., 1992), b1, &tilde;1970 bp from plasmid pBcDNA (Radicella et al., 1991), and c2, 1450 bp cDNA from plasmid cLC46E (Wienand et al., 1986). Strips of nitrocellulose with the slot-blotted gene fragments were pre-hybridized for 3 hours in 4 ml hybridization solution at 42&deg; C. &lsqb;5&times; SSPE (1&times; SSPE&equals;0.15M NaCl, 0.01M Sodium phosphate, 0.001M EDTA), 0.1% polyvinyl pyrrolidine, 0.1% Ficoll, 50% formamide, 12.5 &mgr;g/ml tRNA&rsqb;. Pre-hybridization solution was replaced with labelled RNA heat-denatured in 2.5 ml hybridization solution. After 60-72 hours at 42&deg; C., strips were briefly rinsed, washed twice for 15 minutes each at 42&deg; C. (1&times; SSPE, 0.1% SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)) and once for 15 minutes at 42&deg; C.

<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Global DNA methylation levels were assayed using methylation sensitive restriction enzymes and DNA blots. DNA was isolated from leaves (Dellaporta et al., 1983). DNA (&tilde;4 &mgr;g) was digested according to manufacturer specifications (New England Biolabs, Bethesda Research Laboratories and Pharmacia), and size-fractionated by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels with 0.5&times; TBE (0.045M Tris-borate, 0.001 M EDTA). The DNA was transferred to charged Hybond N&plus; (Amersham) membrane with alkaline transfer buffer (0.4M NaOH, 0.6M NaCl). The 45S ribosomal repeat (McMullen et al., 1986; McMullen et al., 1991) and the centromere repeat from sorghum (pSau3a9; Jiang et al., 1996) were radioactively labelled using random hexamer priming (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983). Hybridization was performed in a rotating hybridization oven at 65&deg; C. with 5% SDS, 50 mM PIPES pH 6.5, 50 mM NaHPO4 pH 7, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl and 100 &mgr;g/ml salmon sperm DNA.

<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> Identification and Genetic Characterization of Mop1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> Paramutation always occurs when B&prime; and B-I are heterozygous, and B&prime; is extremely stable in subsequent generations (reviewed in Chandler et al., 2000). These characteristics enable a simple genetic screen to isolate mutations affecting paramutation. Furthermore, the phenotypes of B-1 and B&prime; are readily distinguishable even in young seedlings; B-I seedlings have intense anthocyanin pigmentation, and B&prime; seedlings have little or no anthocyanin pigmentation. A screening population was generated by crossing B&prime; plants by B-I plants carrying active Mutator (Mu) transposable elements. F1 plants were screened for darkly pigmented (B-I-like) individuals, which could represent dominant mutations preventing the establishment of paramutation. All F1 individuals (&gt;3500) were lightly pigmented (By), indicating that paramutation had occurred without exception. To identify recessive mutations that may represent failure to maintain the repressed B&prime; transcription state, F1 individuals were self-pollinated and F2 families were screened for darkly pigmented (B-I-like) seedlings segregating at &frac14; frequency. Darkly anthocyanin pigmented B-I-like individuals are referred herein as dark and lightly anthocyanin pigmented B&prime;-like individuals are referred herein as light. Several F2 families yielded dark seedlings (25 of 510 families screened). Segregation in subsequent crosses confirmed the presence of a recessive mutation at a single locus in each of these families (data not shown). The high frequency of families segregating dark seedlings was not observed in a similar screen resulting from the cross of a B&prime; Mu stock with B-I; none of the F2 families yielded dark seedlings (zero of 427 families screened). The high frequency in one set of stocks, but not in the other, suggested that a recessive mutation had been present in some of the B-I Mu stocks used in these experiments. Consistent with this hypothesis, genetic complementation tests among plants from the 25 families yielded dark seedlings, confirming that each of these families carried a mutation in the same gene (data not shown). Pedigree analyses demonstrated that this mutation was segregating in the B-I Mu stocks. Based on subsequent analyses described below, we have designated the locus identified by this mutation mediator of paramutationl (Mop1), and the mutant allele Mop1-1. Recessive Mop1-1 likely represents a reduced or loss of function allele; individuals heterozygous for Mop1-1 have B&prime; pigment levels, which is defined as wild-type for this genetic background. As these individuals possess the Mop1 allele normally present in most maize stocks, we will refer to the Mop1 allele as wild-type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Mop1-1 Alters the Phenotype of Both B&prime; and PI&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The fact that Mop1-1 was isolated as dark, B-I-resembling seedlings among light B&prime; siblings indicated that Mop1-1 modified the phenotype of B&prime; seedlings to resemble a B-I phenotype. A similar modification of the B&prime; phenotype is observed in mature plants. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> show the adult phenotypes of B&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 and B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</cross-reference> illustrate the very similar phenotype of B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 and B-I Mop1/Mop1 plants. These results are consistent with the Mop1 gene having a role in the maintenance of the paramutant B&prime; state. Though B&prime; Mop1-1 plants resemble B-I plants, they occasionally show somatic instability, manifest as sectors of B&prime;-like pigmentation similar to that seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>. This observation suggests that the Mop1-1 mutation is unstable and may be caused by a transposable element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> Does Mop1-1 also alter the phenotype of the paramutant PI&prime; allele&quest; To address this question, it is necessary to assay the pI1 expression phenotype independent of changes in b1 expression, yet to activate the anthocyanin pathway, pI1 must be co-expressed with a bHLH factor (b1 or r1). The anthers represent a reliable tissue in which to assay pI1 expression because r1, but no b1 allele, is expressed in the anthers. Fortunately, the r1 gene expressed in the anthers does not undergo spontaneous paramutation, thus changes in anther pigment reflect changes in pI1 expression. Our homozygous B&prime; Mop1-1 stocks lacked r1 expression in the anthers (homozygous for the null R-g allele), therefore we introduced R-r, which is expressed in both seeds and anthers. In the presence of R-r, PI&prime; gives variegated (light) anthers, whereas PI-Rh gives fully-pigmented (dark) anthers. Light-anthered B&prime;/b1-W23 PI&prime;/PI&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 R-r/R-g individuals were self-pollinated, and purple kernels (inheriting dominant R-r) were planted. Recessive b1-W23 produces a green plant when homozygous, but b1 segregation will not affect anther pigmentation. If Mop1-1 intensifies PI&prime;, then &frac14; dark-anthered progeny are expected to segregate. Light-anthered individuals, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>E, and dark-anthered individuals, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>F, were observed among the F2 progeny at the expected frequency (9 of 47 dark; chi-squared&equals;0.858, P 0.35). Three-quarters of these plants were B&prime;/&minus; (either B/B&prime; or B&prime;/b1-W23), and intensification of the B&prime; phenotype in the dark-anthered individuals confirmed they were Mop1-1/Mop1-1. This result demonstrated that Mop1-1 is not specific to B&prime; but also affects the paramutant PI&prime; allele. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Mop1-1 Does Not Heritably Alter B&prime;, but Can Heritably Alter PI&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> Under some conditions, paramutant alleles can return to the higher expression state characteristic of the paramutable allele. This has been observed for paramutant alleles of pI1 and rl, though not for b1 (reviewed in Chandler et al., 2000). Genetic crosses were performed to test whether Mop1-1 heritably alters B&prime; to B-I or PI&prime; to PI-Rh as diagrammed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. When B&prime; Mop1-1 individuals are crossed with plants null for b1 and wild-type for Mop1 (Mop1), all progeny are light (B&prime;/b Mop1/Mop1-1; &gt;400 plants from &gt;20 families) demonstrating the light pigment phenotype of B&prime; is not heritably altered by Mop1-1. Furthermore, crosses between B&prime; Mop1-1 and B-I Mop1 individuals, both of which are dark, also generate all light progeny &lsqb;B&prime;/(B-I)&prime;, Mop1/Mop1-1; &gt;100 plants from 6 families&rsqb; indicating the B&prime; allele transmitted from homozygous Mop1-1 plants is fully capable of causing paramutation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) in a Mop1/Mop1-1 nucleus. Thus, Mop1-1 does not disrupt the inheritance of the B&prime; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> To test whether the PI&prime; allele in homozygous PI&prime; Mop1-1 plants can be heritably altered to PI-Rh, dark-anthered PI&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals were crossed with PI-Rh Mop1/Mop1 testers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). Progeny of this cross were scored with respect to anther pigmentation, using the anther color scale previously described (Hollick et al., 1995). In this scale, individuals with an Anther Color Score (ACS) of 7 are PI-Rh. Most progeny (&tilde;75%) had lightly pigmented anthers, indicating PI&prime; could be transmitted from homozygous Mop1-1 plants. However, dark-anthered individuals (PI-Rh-like, ACS 7) were sometimes observed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This is in contrast to control crosses in which sibling PI&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 plants were crossed to PI-Rh testers and all progeny had lightly pigmented anthers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Not all PI&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals produced dark-anthered progeny. In a total of 12 progeny families, representing testcrosses from 11 different individuals, only six families had some dark-anthered progeny. All six of these families were from homozygous PI&prime;/PI&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 individuals in which one of the PI&prime; alleles was exposed to homozygous Mop1-1 for two consecutive generations. In contrast, no ACS 7 progeny were observed from any of the four PI&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals in which the PI&prime; alleles were exposed to homozygous Mop1-1 for a single generation. Thus, Mop1-1 can, but does not always, heritably alter PI&prime; to PI-Rh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Mop1-1 Increases Transcription of B&prime; and Amounts of PI&prime; Transcripts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> To test whether changes in pigment are the result of changes in transcript levels and transcription, as observed with b1 and pI1 paramutation (Patterson et al., 1993; Hollick et al., 2000), RNA levels and transcription rate were determined. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, analysis of RNA levels in husk tissue using RNase protection assays reveal a dramatic (46 fold) increase in b1 RNA in B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 relative to B&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 siblings. RNase protections also reveal a significant (5.6 fold) increase in pI1 RNA levels in PI&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 relative to PI&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 siblings (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). These increases in b1 transcript levels are consistent with (though higher than) the 10-20 fold differences in transcript levels between B-I and B&prime; (Patterson et al., 1993). Increases in pI1 transcript levels are also similar to (though less than) those differences seen between PI&prime; and PI-Rh (Hollick et al., 2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> To determine if the increased transcript levels of homozygous B&prime; Mop1-1 plants are associated with increased transcription, in vitro transcription assays were performed on nuclei isolated from sheath tissue. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, these assays reveal that the transcription rate of b1 is increased in sheaths of B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants relative to Mop1/Mop1-1 siblings. The results of three independent pairwise comparisons between sibling Mop1-1/Mop1-1 and Mop1/Mop1-1 individuals are shown graphically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. RNase protection assays were done using the same samples to determine the transcript levels in the same sheath tissues. The results of pairwise comparisons of RNA levels for the same six individuals are summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. The in vitro transcription assays reveal a 3-4.5 fold increase in transcription rate whereas RNase protection assays reveal a 7-13 fold increase in transcript levels in the same tissues. Similar differences in fold increase (5-8 versus 13-14) of RNA levels versus transcription rate are observed at c2, a gene regulated by b1 and pI1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A and data not shown). Overall, the dramatic pigmentation differences between B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 and B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 siblings can be explained by increased b1 transcript levels, which can be at least partially explained by an increase in b1 transcription rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> Mop1 Does Not Affect Neutral Alleles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> To determine whether Mop1-1 is a general modifier of the anthocyanin regulators, or is specific to those alleles that participate in paramutation, we tested the ability of Mop1-1 to enhance the pigment levels of b1 and pI1 alleles that do not participate in paramutation. The B-Peru allele has dark aleurone pigment, has extremely weak plant pigment that is readily distinguishable from B, and does not participate in paramutation (Patterson et al., 1995). As diagrammed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, B&prime;PIR-g Mop1-1 plants were crossed with a B-Peru PIR-g Mop1 stock, and four F1 individuals were self-pollinated. Only purple F2 kernels were planted to select for homozygous or heterozygous B-Peru. Among these progeny, three classes of plant color phenotypes were observed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). As intensification of B&prime; plant pigmentation would preclude any conclusions about Mop1-1 intensification of the lighter B-Peru plant pigmentation, it was essential to compare only homozygous B-Peru individuals, identified by the presence of 100% purple kernels on the ears produced by these individuals. All 24 individuals characterized as having typical B-Peru plant pigment had ears with 100% purple kernels, confirming their b1 genotype as B-Peru/B-Peru. These plants were testcrossed with B&prime;/B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants to determine their Mop1 genotype. If any of these individuals were also homozygous for Mop1-1, they would be expected to produce 100% dark progeny (plant phenotype) from the testcrosses with B&prime; Mop1-1. Four of the homozygous B-Peru individuals met this expectation, and thus had been homozygous for Mop1-1. The fact that their pigment phenotypes were indistinguishable from their B-Peru/B-Peru Mop1/Mop1-1 or B-Peru/B-Peru Mop1/Mop1 siblings demonstrates that Mop1-1 does not intensify B-Peru pigmentation. All plants that had the B&prime; Mop1-1 or B&prime; Mop1/&minus; phenotype (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) were confirmed to be heterozygous for B&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> In the process of introducing Mop1-1 into other genetic backgrounds, a stock was generated that contained B-bar and pI-W22, weakly pigmented neutral alleles of b1 and pI1, respectively. Three dark plants, subsequently shown to be B-bar/B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 pI-W22/pI-W22, were self-pollinated, producing &frac34; dark and &frac14; light progeny (76 dark vs. 25 light). PCR analyses confirmed that the light progeny were homozygous for B-bar and the darks all contained at least one B&prime; allele. The fact that these light progeny resembled B-bar Mop1/&minus; pI-W22 plants demonstrated that Mop1-1 did not intensify B-bar. As these plants were also homozygous for pI-W22, an allele of pI1 which does not participate in paramutation (Hollick et al., 1995), Mop1-1 effects on a neutral pI1 allele could also be examined. All plants had weak pI-W22 anther color. Together with the results described above with B-Peru, these results suggest that the Mop1-1 intensification of pigment is selective for paramutant alleles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Mop1-1 Inhibits the Establishment of b1 Paramutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> To determine whether Mop1 is involved in the establishment of b1 paramutation, we asked whether B-I could be paramutated when it encounters B&prime; in a homozygous Mop1-1 nucleus. To address this question, homozygous B&prime; Mop1-1 individuals were crossed, as diagrammed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, with plants heterozygous for B-I/b1-K55 and Mop1/Mop1-1. The b1-K55 allele is recessive, producing a green plant when homozygous. B&prime;/B-I and B&prime;/b1-K55 were differentiated by restriction fragment length polymorphisms between the B-1 and b1-K55 alleles, and each class was crossed with both B-I/B-Peru testers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) and with b1 testers (not diagrammed). A feature of the B-I/B-Peru cross is that the B-I allele is frequently more stable (less prone to spontaneous paramutation to B) when heterozygous with a neutral allele. Furthermore, the purple aleurone pigmentation of B-Peru kernels provides a useful marker for the allele, and the weak B-Peru plant pigmentation is recessive to and readily distinguished from B-1 or B&prime; pigmentation (Radicella et al., 1992; Patterson et al., 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Among offspring of B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants crossed to B-I/B-Peru (Mop1/Mop1), purple kernels (inheriting the B-Peru allele of the tester) gave rise to plants segregating 50% light (original B) and 50% dark (unaltered B-1) individuals, as shown in Table 2. A similar result was obtained among offspring of B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants crossed with b1 tester stocks (b1-K55/b1-K55 Mop1/Mop1 or b1-K55/b1-W23 Mop1/Mop1). Eighteen of 43 plants were dark or medium-dark and the remaining 25 individuals were light (Table 2). Medium-dark individuals could be explained by spontaneous paramutation of B-1 to B&prime;, or PI-Rh to PI&prime;, which is often observed for these alleles (Coe, 1966; Hollick et al., 1995). Some of these individuals were crossed with appropriate tester stocks, and the phenotypes of progeny were consistent with spontaneous paramutation of PI-Rh causing the reduction in pigment. Control crosses of B&prime;/B-1 Mop1/Mop1-1 plants to the same B-I/B-Peru and b1 tester stocks produced all light progeny. These results demonstrate that paramutation is not established in Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, colorless kernels from the same crosses to the B-I/B-Peru tester (inheriting the B-I allele of the tester) gave fewer than the expected 50% B-1 plants (Table 2). Many individuals were dark toward the base of the plant, but appeared to lighten progressively during development such that at anthesis, 46 plants were scored as medium or light and only three as dark (B-I). Possible reasons for the decreased frequency of B-I offspring in this experiment include spontaneous paramutation of the B-I allele from the tester, or subtle destabilization of the B-I allele transmitted from the B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants. These hypotheses are considered more thoroughly in the discussion. Nevertheless, Mop1-1 is clearly able to inhibit the establishment of paramutation in B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants, as dark offspring carrying B-I segregate from these individuals. This is in sharp contrast to stocks wildtype for Mop1 in which paramutation always occurs (Coe, 1966; Patterson et al., 1993; Patterson et al., 1995).

<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> We also examined whether Mop1-1 inhibits the establishment of pI1 paramutation, though this experiment is complicated by the fact that PI&prime; can occasionally be heritably altered to PI-Rh in homozygous Mop1-1 plants. To ensure that the allele entering the cross was the paramutagenic PI&prime;, light-anthered PI&prime;/PI&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1 plants (in which PI&prime; is stable and does not change to PI-Rh) were crossed with dark-anthered PI-Rh/PI-Rh Mop1/Mop1-1 plants. Each of these stocks also carried the B&prime; allele, which enabled an independent assay of the Mop1 genotype. Among the progeny, there was perfect cosegregation of dark plant and anther pigmentation (Mop1-1/Mop1-1). Three dark-anthered individuals (PI&prime;/PI-Rh) were crossed with a b1-K55 PI-Rh tester to determine whether paramutation occurred (all progeny should have light anthers) or whether the PI-Rh allele could be inherited unaltered (50% dark and 50% light anthered plants). The resulting progeny segregated 39 purple-anthered PI-Rh plants and 36 light-anthered PI&prime; plants. The simplest explanation for this result is that Mop1-1/Mop1-1 prevented the establishment of paramutation resulting in the segregation of the original PI-Rh and PI&prime; alleles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Mop1-1 Inhibits the Establishment of r1 Paramutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the phenomenology of r1 paramutation is very different from that of b1. We asked whether Mop1-1 is able to affect paramutation at r1. Our B&prime; Mop1-1 stocks contained the R-g allele of r1, which does not participate in paramutation (Kermicle et al., 1995). These Mop1-1 R-g stocks were crossed with stocks wildtype for mop1 (Mop1) and containing r1 haplotypes that participate in paramutation. The term haplotype is used for complexes composed of multiple r1 genes. The r1 haplotypes used included paramutagenic R-stippled (R-st) and two paramutable haplotypes, standard R-r and R-d:Catspaw (R-d). The F1&apos;s between R-st and Mop1-1 (R-st/R-g; Mop1/Mop1-1) were intercrossed with F1&apos;s of the paramutable haplotypes (R-d/R-g or R-r/R-g; Mop1/Mop1-1). Thus, the paramutagenic and paramutable haplotypes were combined in homozygous Mop1-1 mutant progeny, and in siblings wildtype for Mop1 (Mop1/&minus;). Fifty percent of intercross progeny inherited the paramutable haplotype (R-d or R-r), and among these, four genotypes of interest segregate as shown for R-d in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. The presence of B&prime; allows the Mop1 genotype to be easily monitored. Testcrosses of Mop1/&minus; (either Mop1/Mop1 or Mop1/Mop1-1) individuals in which R-d was heterozygous with neutral R-g provide a baseline for wild-type kernel pigmentation. Testcrosses of R-d/R-g plants homozygous for Mop1-1 did not differ detectably from wildtype (Mop1/&minus;), as shown in FIG. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B. Paramutation occurred as expected in the R-st/R-d Mop1/&minus; individuals, manifest as reduced pigment in the R-d progeny (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>). However, siblings homozygous for Mop1-1 showed no reduction of R-d expression (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>). Thus, in individuals homozygous for the Mop1-1 mutation, paramutable R-d exits the cross as if it had been heterozygous with a neutral allele rather than with paramutagenic R-st. Similar results were obtained with the paramutable standard R-r (not shown). This demonstrates that Mop1-1 is able to inhibit the establishment of r1 paramutation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> As shown in Table 3 and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11B, 11C</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>D, plants homozygous for B&prime; Mop1-1 can show direct or indirect developmental abnomalities. The range of effects seen include delayed flowering or reduced stature relative to wild-type siblings, spindly and sometimes barren stalks, and in some instances, aberrant development resulting in feminized tassels (such as that observed in tasselseed mutants&mdash;Irish et al., 1994). We reproducibly see differences in flowering time, whereas other abnormalities appear stochastically. There may be an environmental effect on the frequency with which these developmental abnormalities occur, as the frequency has been highest in our Hawaii nursery during the past two winters. Two alternative hypotheses could explain the correlation of these effects with Mop1-1. The effects could be caused either by other mutations that are linked to Mop1-1, or by the Mop1-1 mutation itself. Recently, a second allele of Mop1 was isolated from a similar screen looking for modification of PI&prime; instead of B&prime; and using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) as the mutagen (Example 3). This independent allele (Mop1-2EMS) provides independent data with which to judge the two alternative hypotheses. B&prime;/&minus; Mop1-2EMS/Mop1-2EMS and B&prime;/&minus; Mop1-1/Mop1-2EMS individuals show the same suite of pleiotropic phenotypes as homozygous Mop1-1 (Table 3). This strongly suggests that these negative pleiotropic effects are the result of the mutant Mop1 locus, rather than the result of linked mutations.

<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Mop1-1 Does Not Affect Global Methylation Levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Although no differences in DNA methylation are observed in comparisons of the paramutagenic and paramutable alleles of b1 and pI1 (within the coding and &tilde;15 kb of the respective flanking regions, Patterson et al., 1993; Hollick et al., 2000), paramutation of R-r correlates with DNA methylation in the transcribed region (Walker, 1998). In other systems, changes in DNA methylation often correlate with differences in transcription, thus one model is that Mop1 encodes a protein that influences global DNA methylation levels such as a DNA methyltransferase (Finnegan et al., 1996) or ddm1 (decrease in DNA methylation, Vongs et al., 1993). Under this model, one could hypothesize that methylation differences occur at b1 and pI1, but these changes occur outside of the regions examined. We tested whether global DNA methylation levels are affected by Mop1-1. DNA blots with methylation sensitive restriction enzymes were prepared to compare homozygous B&prime; Mop1-1 individuals, wild-type siblings (B&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1), and B&prime; stocks (Mop1/Mop1). These blots were hybridized with repeated sequences of the 45S ribosomal region (McMullen et al., 1986) as well as a repeated sequence found at centromeres (Jiang et al., 1996). As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>B, no differences in DNA methylation were detected among the Mop1 genotypes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Mop1 and Paramutuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> Our results demonstrate that Mop1 plays a central role in paramutation; the Mop1-1 mutation disrupts the maintenance and establishment of paramutation at multiple maize loci, but has no effect on alleles that do not participate in paramutation. The pleiotropic developmental phenotypes that stochastically occur in some families segregating Mop1 mutations suggest that Mop1 may have additional regulatory functions beyond paramutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Paramutation at b1, p1 and r1 Shares a Common Mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> There are unique aspects to the behavior of b1, pI1 and r1 alleles participating in paramutation (reviewed in Chandler et al., 2000). r1 paramutation involves structurally distinct haplotypes of a complex or repeated nature. In contrast, B&prime; and PI&prime; are spontaneous derivatives of B-I and PI-Rh, respectively. Furthermore, increased methylation is readily apparent in R-r&prime; relative to R-r (Walker, 1998), whereas such differences have not been observed for b1 and pI1 (Patterson et al., 1993). We have demonstrated that Mop1-1 disrupts the maintenance of B&prime; and PI&prime; expression, the heritability of PI&prime;, and the establishment of b1 and r1 paramutation. These results provide compelling evidence that, despite several phenomenological differences, all three loci use a common molecular factor for paramutation, strongly suggesting that a common mechanism underlies paramutation at these three loci. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> A Role for MOP1 in the Establishment and Maintenance of the Paramutant State. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Our results indicate MOP1 function is clearly involved in all three phases of gene silencing; establishment, maintenance, and heritability (reviewed in Loo and Rine, 1995). When paramutable and paramutagenic alleles of b1, pI1 or r1 are heterozygous, paramutation always occurs (reviewed in Kermicle, 1996; Chandler et al., 2000), yet in nuclei homozygous for Mop1-1, paramutation was not established at b1, r1 or pI1. When PI-Rh was introduced to PI&prime; in homozygous Mop1-1 plants, PI-Rh appeared to be transmitted unaltered as 50% dark-anthered (PI-Rh) and 50% light-anthered (PI) plants segregated. This interpretation is complicated by the fact that homozygous PI&prime; Mop1-1 plants can sometimes produce dark-anthered PI-Rh progeny. However, it seems unlikely that the 50% dark-anthered plants resulted from full establishment of paramutation and subsequent reversion of half the PI&prime; alleles to PI-Rh. The establishment experiment used PI&prime; alleles exposed to homozygous Mop1-1 for a single generation, a condition in which no PI-Rh progeny were observed in other experiments. Thus, the simplest explanation for the 50% segregation observed in this experiment is that Mop1-1 inhibits the establishment of pI1 paramutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> One possibility is that MOP1 mediates or facilitates the interaction between the paramutagenic and paramutable alleles, such that loss of function disrupts that interaction. MOP1 may be necessary for the paramutagenic properties of B&prime;, PI&prime; or R-st, such that loss of function makes these alleles more similar to neutral or paramutable alleles. Perhaps consistent with this, the B&prime; allele is modified by Mop1-1 such that, in homozygous Mop1-1, B&prime; resembles B-I with respect to phenotype, transcription, and the inability to paramutate another B-I allele. The appearance of phenotypically B&prime; sectors in B&prime; Mop1-1 plants further suggests that MOP1 can function throughout development to reduce the expression of B&prime; such that regaining MOP1 function in a somatic sector re-establishes the reduced expression state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> The effect of Mop1-1 on B&prime; provides a very clear demarcation between two of the phases of gene silencing, maintenance and inheritance, as described by Loo and Rine (1995). Though functional MOP1 is required to maintain the reduced transcription state of B&prime;, loss of MOP1 function is not sufficient to disrupt the inheritance of the B&prime; state as it is faithfully and completely restored upon recovering MOP1 function. In fact, we know of no condition in which B&prime; is heritably changed to B-I. We have speculated this is because B&prime; represents the default transcription state specified by the DNA sequence (Patterson et al., 1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> Allele Interactions May Influence the Stability of Epigenetic States. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> Allelic interactions may account for our observation that B-I segregates at different frequencies from B-I/B&prime; Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants depending on what it is crossed with. In crosses to the neutral alleles B-Peru and b1 (b1-K55 or b1-W23), B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants transmitted 50% dark individuals, completely consistent with the failure to establish paramutation in the B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants. Interestingly, fewer than the expected 50% B-I individuals were observed segregating from B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants in crosses to B-I. Observation of B-I progeny at the anticipated 50% frequency would require three conditions: inheritance of an unaltered B-I allele from the B-I/B-Peru tester parent, inheritance of an unaltered B-I allele from B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 individuals, and stability of both B-I alleles in the homozygous B-I progeny individuals. Homozygous B-I is generally less stable than B-I/B-Peru. The developmentally progressive reduction in pigment of many (presumed B-I/B-I) progeny plants appeared similar to, and thus could be explained by, the progression sometimes observed during spontaneous paramutation of B-I to B&prime;. This result could also be caused by a higher than usual rate of spontaneous paramutation of the B-I allele segregating from the B-I/B-Peru tester. Alternatively, the B-I allele segregating from B&prime;/B-I Mop1-1/Mop1-1 may be subtly destabilized. This subtle destabilization could be exacerbated in the next generation by homozygosity with a second B-I allele, whereas it could be overcome in the next generation by heterozygosity with a neutral allele such as B-Peru or b1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> A Model for MOP1 Function and Paramutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> Numerous facets of b1, r1 and pI1 paramutation are consistent with chromatin structural changes, rather than DNA sequence changes, underlying paramutation. The absence of detectable DNA sequence differences between B&prime; and B-I, the multiple levels of PI&prime; expression, and the instability of the paramutant R-r&prime; and PI&prime; states fit well with a chromatin model. We propose that MOP1 functions as a chromatin remodeling protein. As observed for some chromatin related proteins, individuals mutant for Mop1 can show developmental phenotypes (Grossniklaus et al., 1998; Eshed et al., 1999; Kakutani et al., 1999; Ogas et al., 1999). We hypothesize that MOP1 is involved in the assembly of a repressive chromatin structure at b1, pI1 and r1 upon paramutation. This repressive structure could be analogous to Polycomb group (PcG) complexes assembled at Polycomb Response Elements (PRE, Pirrotta, 1998; Hollick et al., 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> The distinct expression states of B-I vs. B&prime; and PI-Rh vs. PI&prime;, as well as the spontaneous and directed alteration of the paramutable alleles, could be explained by this model. The alleles that participate in paramutation are hypothesized to possess PRE-like elements. In the high expression state (B-I or PI-Rh), the elements are not efficiently recognized for PcG-like assembly. We postulate that the chromatin structure can spontaneously change allowing access of PcG-like proteins for assembly, resulting in the B&prime; and PI&prime; states. The fully assembled state of the B&prime; and PI&prime; alleles, when together in a nucleus with the unassembled state, would induce assembly on the paramutable allele (Patterson et al., 1993; Hollick et al., 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Variations on this model can explain differences in stability between the PI&prime; vs. the B&prime; states, and the different effect Mop1-1 has on the heritability of this state. Once assembled in B&prime;, the PcG-like complex would remain quite stable due to multiple, strong interactions between members of the complex and DNA binding sites. When MOP1 function is lacking in B&prime; Mop1-1 homozygotes, several remaining members of the complex stay associated with the PRE-like binding sites, such that restoration of MOP1 function quickly re-establishes the repressive structure, just as some residual proteins are thought to mark PREs for rapid reassembly in Drosophila (Pirrotta, 1998). Divergence or fewer binding sites at pI1 could result in a less stable complex relative to b1. Loss of MOP1 function in PI&prime; Mop1-1 homozygotes, combined with reduced or compromised binding sites, could destabilize the complex such that residual association of the complex with the PRE-like element is reduced in some nuclei resulting in the PI-Rh state. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> Active research into many trans-sensing phenomena involves identifying mutations that disrupt the interaction. As paramutation and other trans-sensing interactions share many features, these screens could identify Mop1 homologues. Our results suggest that Mop1 is unlikely to represent a DNA methyltransferase or ddm1-orthologue, because the Mop1-1 mutation does not alter methylation levels of repetitive centromeric sequences or the 45S ribosomal repeated sequences. The ddm1 locus was identified based upon its effect on methylation levels of repetitive sequences in Arabidopsis, such as the ribosomal genes and centromeric repeats (Vongs et al., 1993). The ddm1 locus has been cloned and it shares similarity with SNF2, a yeast protein involved in chromatin remodeling (Jeddeloh et al., 1999). Interestingly, a related protein in humans has also been shown to decrease global DNA methylation when mutated (Gibbons et al., 2000). Similarly, decreased activity of the DNA methyltransferase of Arabidopsis achieved by antisense expression of a MET1 transgene reduces the methylation levels of repeated sequences (Finnegan et al., 1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> Several mutations altering the transcriptional silencing of plant transgenes have been identified (Furner et al., 1998; Mittelsten Scheid et al., 1998; Amedeo et al., 2000). Some of these mutations turn out to be allelic to ddm1 (Mittelsten Scheid et al., 1998; Jeddeloh et al., 1999), whereas one encodes a novel protein (Amedeo et al., 2000). Several mutations have been identified that disrupt cosuppression or post-transcriptional gene silencing (Elmayan et al., 1998), In is not yet clear whether transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silenciing are mechanistically related (reviewed in Meyer and Saedler, 1996). A screen for mutations affecting transvection at the yellow locus of Drosophila identified exclusively cis-acting mutations at yellow (Morris et al., 1999). Numerous mutations in Drosophila have been isolated that affect position-effect variegation, identifying proteins associated with and involved in chromatin structure (Sass and Henikoff, 1998; Wakimoto, 1998; Wallrath, 1998; Cryderman et al., 1999). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Introduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Very little is known about the mechanism of paramutation. At r1, there is a correlation between the methylation state of some parts of the gene and its expression state (Walker 1998). Also at r1, there is a relationship between the degree of paramutagenicity of an allele and the number of repeats of the coding region and flanking DNA (Kermicle et al. 1995). As a transposon (doppia) is present in the regulatory region of several paramutable alleles of r1, it has been suggested that this transposable element is causally related to paramutation. However, this relationship remains correlative, and there are paramutagenic alleles of r1, such as R-marbled, that do not carry this transposon (Panavas et al. 1999). Further, despite the fact that the promoter region of the paramutable B-I allele is littered with transposable elements, no correlation between methylation of these elements and transcription level has been observed at b1 (Patterson et al. 1993), or pI1 (Hollick et al. 2000). Thus, there is no consistent correlation to date between paramutation and transposable element methylation within or nearby a gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Recently, a mutation, Mop1-1, has been isolated which prevents paramutation at b1, r1, and pI1 (Dorweiler et al. 2000). When this mutation is homozygous, the normally low expressing allele of b1, B&prime;, expresses at the level of the high expressing allele, B-I. This results in the dark purple plant color characteristic of the B-I allele as opposed to the lighter and sporadic purple color characteristic of the B&prime; allele. Further, when B&prime; is heterozygous with B-I in a Mop1-1 homozygous background paramutation is prevented, with both the B&prime; and B-I phenotypes transmitted upon out crossing. In the absence of the Mop1-1 mutation only the B&prime; phenotype is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Although in Mop1-1 homozygotes B&prime; expresses at the level of B-I and it cannot paramutate B-I, it is not heritably altered to B-I, because when out crossed to generate a heterozygote (Mop1/Mop1-1) B&prime; is observed. These results suggest that the Mop1 gene product is involved with the process of paramutation, but it does not alter the heritable state of B&prime;. The Mop1-1 mutation also prevents the establishment of paramutation at the pI1 and r1 loci, indicating that the Mop1 gene product is a general regulator of paramutation (Dorweiler et al. 2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> Herein we show that mutations in Mop1 can prevent and reverse Mu element methylation. Despite this reversal of methylation, we do not see reactivation of Mu element transposition in these genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the Mu inactive state is not reversible by Mop1 mutations. Because the Mop1 mutation affects multiple loci, each of which has very different promoter sequences, we hypothesize that this mutation is operating on chromatin configuration, rather than specific sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Materials and Methods: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Genetic Crosses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> In the crosses that follow, a single allele listing indicates homozygosity, whereas heterozygous individuals are indicated with alleles separated by a slash (/). Following maize genetic nomenclature, recessive alleles are indicated by lower case and dominant alleles are indicated by capitalization of the first letter. Unless indicated otherwise all stocks carry functional alleles of all the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. The alleles of the regulatory genes r1, b1, and pI1 that are in each stock are indicated for each cross. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Generation of a Mop1I Homozygote. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> The Mop1-1 homozygous plant used in crosses with MuKiller was generated as follows: B&prime; PIR-g (recessive allele of r1 with no pigment and no paramutation activity) Mop1-1 plants were crossed to B&prime; PIR-g Mop1, and the resulting F1 plants were back crossed to B&prime; PIR-g Mop1-1 plants. Homozygous Mop1-1 mutants are darkly pigmented in leaf sheaths, husks and tassel branches and glumes, while the Mop1/Mop1-1 heterozygotes are lightly pigmented in the same tissues (Dorweiler et al. 2000). As this stock was derived from an active Mutator stock, it carried multiple MuDR elements and hypomethylated MuDR and Mu1 elements as evidenced by DNA blotting (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Generation of a Plant Carrying MuKiller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> To detect MuDR activity we used a1-mum2. This mutation contains a Mu1 insertion in the 5&prime; promoter region of the al anthocyanin biosynthesis gene (O&apos;Reilly et al. 1985). In the presence of active MUDR elements excisions of Mu1 can be scored as somatic purple sectors in the kernels. MuKiller, a dominant factor present in some lines but not in our minimal Mutator line, is competent to silence a single MuDR element (Lisch and Freeling 1994). A plant carrying a single MuDR element on chromosome 2L (Chomet et al. 1991) with the genotype B&prime; pI-sr (allele of pI1 that confers sun-red anthers and husks) R-g (r1 allele that confers purple seed) al-mum2 MUDR/&minus; was crossed to a line carrying MuKiller (MuK) and no active MuDR elements (B&prime; pI-sr R-g a1-mum2 MuK/&plus;). The resulting plants were scored for the presence of newly silenced MuDR elements as indicated by the reduced excision frequency of the Mu1 element from a1-mum2 and methylation of Mu1 elements in the presence of MuDR. Of nine individuals examined in this family, three carried at least one full-length MuDR element and several methylated Mu1 elements, consistent with the epigenetic silencing of MuDR elements by the MuK activity segregating in this family. The first ear of one such plant was used in the cross with a Mop1-1/Mop1-1 homozygote as described below. The second ear was crossed to a plant lacking MuDR elements and homozygous for the a1-mum2 reporter (Chomet et al. 1991). None of the kernels resulting from this test cross showed evidence of excisions of Mu1 from a1-mum2, confirming the silencing of MuDR in this family. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> Crossing Mop1-1 to MuKiller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> A single B&prime; PIR-g A1 Mop1-1 plant was crossed to a plant carrying a silenced MuDR element (as described above). The resulting progeny were self-fertilized, yielding Mop1-1 homozygotes, Mop1-1/Mop1 heterozygotes and Mop1 homozygotes. To generate a second generation of Mop1-1 homozygous plants, B&prime; Mop1-1 homozygous plants resulting from the above cross were identified by their dark plant pigment and were crossed to Mop1-1/Mop1 siblings and the resulting plants were scored for the Mop1-1 phenotype. To test for reversals of Mu element methylation, Mop1/Mop1-1 progeny from that cross, which carried methylated Mu elements, were self fertilized to generate Mop1-1 homozygous mutants that had been heterozygous and methylated in the previous generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> Isolation of Mop1-1 Stocks Lacking MuDR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Plants carrying Mop1-1 in the absence of full length MUDR were isolated from the same genetic background as those carrying full length MuDR elements by screening for the loss of MuDR using DNA blots. The absence of MuDR was determined by digestion with SacI, XbaI, and EcoRI&plus;HindIII. Diagnostic fragments for full length MuDR elements were absent in these lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Isolation of Stocks Carrying Silenced MuDR Elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Plants carrying MuDR at the original position from which it was first cloned (Chomet et al. 1991) were crossed to plants carrying MuKiller. Progeny that carried both MuDR and methylation of HinfI sites in Mu1 elements, consistent with the activity of MuKiller, were self-fertilized to generate stocks that were homozygous for silenced MuDR. The progeny kernels, all of which lacked excisions of Mu1 from the reporter a1-mum2 allele, were screened by DNA gel blot for the presence of homozygous MuDR elements. These plants were again self-fertilized to generate stocks carrying homozygous silenced MuDR elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Generation of seeds carrying a single silenced MuDR element that were also homozygous for Mop1-2EMS. Plants carrying homozygous silenced MuDR elements (a1-mum2; MuDR, R-g) were crossed to plants that were A1, R-g, Mop1-2EMS (an EMS-induced allele of Mop1) and that lacked full-length MuDR elements. The progeny plants were self-fertilized, and the resulting families were screened for the presence of spotted kernels. If Mop1-2EMS reactivated silenced MuDR elements, then only the resulting kernels that were homozygous for a1-mum2 (&frac14;), carried R-g/R-g or R-g/R-g (and not r1 mottled) (&frac12;), homozygous for Mop1-2EMS (&frac14;) and carrying MuDR* ({fraction (34)}) would be expected to be spotted. Thus, the expected frequency of spotted kernels was 2.34% (&frac14;&times;&frac12;&times;&frac14;&times;&frac34;). In addition to self-fertilization, some plants were crossed to plants that were homozygous for Mop1-1, a1-mum2, and R-g. The expected frequency of spotted kernels in the families generated from these crosses was 6.5% (&frac12; a1-mum2/a1-mum2&times;&frac12; R-g/R-g or R-g/R-g&times;&frac12; MuDR&times;&frac12; Mop1/Mop1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> DNA Preparation and Genomic Blotting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> DNA preparation and genomic blotting were performed as previously described (Dorweiler et al. 2000). A plasmid of Mu1 was as previously described (Talbert et al. 1989). To generate an internal probe for Mu1, the plasmid was digested with AvaI and BstEII, and the internal fragment was gel isolated. An internal fragment of MuDR bounded by EcoRI and BamHI was as described (Chomet et al. 1991). The b1 upstream probe used to generate the data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 16</cross-reference> was previously described in (Patterson et al. 1993) and (Patterson et al. 1995). As a control for partial digestion of DNA, blots were reprobed with a KpnI fragment of the al gene spanning a region of the coding sequence adjacent to (but not including) the Mu1 insertion in this gene (O&apos;Reilly et al. 1985). As a control for the blot with the SacI digest in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the blot was probed with a single copy PstI fragment flanking but not including the MuDR insertion on chromosome 2L (not shown) (Lisch et al. 1995). That same probe was used to identify individuals containing that specific MuDR insertion in MuDR reactivation experiments. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> The Mop1-1 Mutation Prevents the Dominant Methylation of Mu Elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> The Mop1-1 mutation was originally isolated in a Mutator active line (Dorweiler et al. 2000) with multiple copies of both MuDR and Mu1, all of which were hypomethylated (data not shown). To examine the interaction between the Mop1-1 mutation and methylation of the Mutator system, it was necessary to inactivate the active MuDR elements in the Mop1-1 line. To accomplish this, a Mop1-1 homozygote was crossed to a plant from a family carrying MuKiller (MuK) a factor that dominantly inactivates the Mutator system (Lisch and Freeling 1994). Details of these crosses are provided in Materials and methods within this example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> Several plants resulting from the cross between the Mop1-1 mutant and the plant carrying MuK were self-fertilized, and progeny were visually scored for the Mop1-1 phenotype (dark purple plants). The methylation status of both the autonomous MuDR elements and the non-autonomous Mu1 and related Mu1.7 elements was determined using DNA blots. One such family is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. In this family, 21 progeny were examined (Table 4, family 1162-3&times;). Four of the 21 plants exhibited a strong Mop1-1/Mop1-1 phenotype (lanes 1-4). As the parent of this family was B&prime;, the dark purple color of these plants was diagnostic for the presence of the Mop1-1 mutation. In addition to their dark pigment these plants were significantly shorter than their wild-type siblings, and none of them produced ears, consistent with previous observations of pleiotropic effects of this mutation (Dorweiler et al. 2000). To determine the effect of Mop1-1 on methylation of Mu1 elements due to MuK, DNA from these plants was digested with HinfI and probed with an internal Mu1 fragment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>). As a digestion control, the blot of the HinfI digest was probed with a fragment of the a1 gene flanked by HinfI sites that are not normally methylated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference>). To assay for changes in methylation of MuDR termini, the same samples were digested with SacI and probed with an internal MuDR fragment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</cross-reference>). Because both of these enzymes are methylation sensitive, a reduction or elimination of the expected internal fragment is indicative of methylation of these sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> Of the Mop1-1/Mop1 or Mop1/Mop1 siblings (lanes 5-21), half (9/17) had methylated Mu1 elements (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>). The SacI digest revealed that although these particular plants did have the fragment diagnostic for at least one full length MuDR element, it was reduced in intensity and that reduction was accompanied by the appearance of additional, larger fragments (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</cross-reference>). This observation is consistent with the methylation of sites within both MuDR and Mu1 TIRs seen previously in plants undergoing epigenetic silencing (Chandler and Walbot 1986, Martienssen and Baron 1994, Lisch and Freeling 1994), and is presumably due to the activity of MuK in this family. In contrast, none of the four Mop1-1 homozygotes had methylated Mu1 or MuDR elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> Additional individuals from two other similarly derived families (Table 4, families 1181-1 &times; and 1162-2&times;) were examined. A total of 41 progeny from self fertilizations of Mop1-1/Mop1 heterozygotes from this first generation were examined by both phenotype and DNA gel blot, including 10 Mop1-1 homozygotes and 31 of their wild-type siblings. The frequency of methylation of Mop1/Mop1 and Mop1/Mop1-1 individuals depended on the methylation status of the parent. In the two families generated from the self-fertilization of plants that had hypomethylated Mu1 elements (1162-3&times; and 1181-1&times;), a total of 13 of the 24 plants with the wild-type phenotype (Mop1/Mop1 or Mop1-1/Mop1) had methylated Mu1 elements. In the family generated from a parent that already had methylated Mu1 elements (1162-2&times;), all seven of seven wild-type progeny had methylated Mu1 elements. In contrast, the Mu1 elements in all 10 of the Mop1-1/Mop1-1 homozygotes from the three families carried hypomethylated Mu1 elements. Given the frequency of methylated Mu elements in their wild-type siblings, we can expect with 99.9% confidence that at least one of the mutants would have had methylated Mu1 elements if Mop1-1 were not affecting methylation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> To test the heritability of this phenomenon, Mop1-1 homozygotes from the family shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> were crossed to three different Mu inactive hypermethylated wild-type siblings. One family produced no Mop1-1 plants, suggesting that the inactive parent lacked the Mop1-1 mutation. Two other families (1510 and 1511) segregated for the Mop1-1 phenotype in the expected ratio (14/29 and 5/17 dark progeny, respectively). An analysis of family 1511 is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Family 1511 was derived from a cross between the two siblings shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> (that in lane 4 by that in lane 15). In both of these families, all of the resulting Mop1-1/Mop1-1 plants carried hypomethylated Mu1 elements. In contrast, none of the wild-type Mop1/Mop1-1 plants carried hypomethylated Mu1 elements (Table 4).

<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> The Mop1-1 Mutation Reverses the Effects of Previous Methylation of the Mu Elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> To confirm that the Mop1-1 mutation could reverse previously established Mu1 element methylation, several plants that were heterozygous for Mop1-land that carried methylated Mu1 elements (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) were self-fertilized. The resulting families were scored for both the Mop1-1 phenotype (dark purple pigment) and methylation of Mu1 elements (families 1510-1&times;, 1510-9&times;, and 1511-6&times;, Table 4). In the figure, one individual from family 1511 (Panel A, lane 6) was self-fertilized to give rise to family 1511-6&times; (Panel D). Consistent with the segregation of a single recessive mutation, roughly one quarter (7/38) of all of these progeny had the Mop1-1 phenotype (Table 4). All 7 of the Mop1-1/Mop1-1 homozygotes examined had hypomethylated Mu1 elements relative to their wild-type siblings, all of which carried methylated Mu1 elements. Thus, the Mop1-1 mutation reverses previously established methylation of Mu1 elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> The Mop1-1 Mutation Reverses Mu1 Methylation in the Absence of Full-Length MuDR Elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> Normally, there is a very tight correlation between hypomethylation of Mu1 elements and the presence of intact, functional MuDR elements, suggesting that the MuDR transposase is required to prevent a default methylation pathway that targets Mu elements (Chandler and Hardeman 1992). The Mop1-1 homozygous plants provide the first exception to this rule. Although Mop1-1 was derived from a Mutator line, we have identified several lineages that lack intact, functional MuDR elements. That is, they lack diagnostic fragments when digested with SacI (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>), XbaI, or with an EcoRI, HindIII double-digest (data not shown). Based on this observation, we conclude that these lines do not carry intact, functional MuDR elements. Despite this, we find that the Mop1-1 plants in these lines still carry hypomethylated Mu1 elements. We examined two families in more detail, one of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. In these families, which were the products of the self-fertilization of plants heterozygous for Mop1-1, hypomethylation of Mu1 cosegregated with the Mop1-1 phenotype. Including the individuals shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> total of eight Mop1-1 mutant and eight wild-type siblings were examined. The Mu1 elements of all of the Mop1-1 plants were hypomethylated relative to the Mu1 elements of their wild type siblings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> A Second Allele of Mop1 Also Hypomethylates Mu1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> To eliminate the possibility that there was a factor modifying Mu1 methylation that was only coincidentally linked to Mop1-1, we also examined a family segregating a different allele of Mop1, Mop1-2EMS. This family was derived from a non-Mutator stock that had been EMS mutagenized (Hollick and Chandler 2001). DNA from six Mop1-2EMS mutants and six Mop1/Mop1-2EMS siblings were digested with HinfI and probed with Mu1. As with Mop1-1, the Mu1 elements in the mutant plants were significantly less methylated than their wild-type siblings (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> The Mop1-1 Mutation does not Reverse Methylation of Sites Immediately Upstream of the b1 Locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> Given that the Mop1-1 mutation reverses Mu1 methylation, we wanted to determine whether or not it affects methylation of sequences elsewhere in the genome. We were particularly interested in examining sequences around B&prime;, as mutations in Mop1 increase transcription of B&prime; (Dorweiler et al. 2000). There are a number of sites upstream of the B&prime; and B-I transcription unit (these alleles share identical restriction maps) that have been previously assayed for methylation status (Patterson et al. 1993, Patterson et al. 1995) (GenBank, accession no. X70790 S48060). No differences in methylation had been observed between B-I and B&prime; plants, suggesting that, unlike the situation at the r1 locus, methylation in the promoter proximal and 5&prime; untranslated region is not correlated with the 10-20 fold difference in transcription. The methylation status of various restriction sites upstream of B&prime; and B-I is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. We observed no difference between B&prime; Mop1-1, B&prime; Mop1/Mop1-1, and B-I Mop1 plants at the HinfI site 1.8 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, panel C) or between Mop1-1 homozygotes and heterozygotes at the ApaI, SalI, or PvuII sites (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). Each of the last three digests was performed in combination with BamHI. The complete absence of the expected 12 kb BamHI fragment in each of the double digests suggests that at least one of the sites recognized by the methyl-sensitive enzyme in each double digest was digested to completion. Thus, partial digestion of any specific site was due to methylation, rather than incomplete digestion. Interestingly, these sites are all within transposable elements, suggesting that methylation of transposons in the promoter proximal region of B&prime; is not affected by Mop1-1. These elements include a MITE element immediately upstream of the start of transcription and the Muse element (a distant relative of MuDR; V. Chandler, D. Selinger and M. Stam, personal observation). Together, these data suggest that Mop1-1 is not a global regulator of transposon methylation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> Progeny of Plants Homozygous for the mop1-1 Mutation for Multiple Generations can Show Mu Element Somatic Excision: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> To determine if reactivation could occur in subsequent generations, one family segregating for both the mop1-2EMS mutation and a single silenced MuDR element was planted, subjected to DNA gel blot analysis, and out-crossed. Nine plants from this family were examined. Four of the nine plants contained hypomethylated Mu1 elements, consistent with good penetrance of this aspect of the mop1-2EMS phenotype. Using a probe flanking the single MuDR element in this family, the presence of MuDR was confirmed in five of the nine plants. Two plants carried both hypomethylated Mu1 elements (mop1-2EMS homozygotes) and the silent MuDR element. One of these plants died. The other was self-fertilized and out crossed to a plant that was mop1-1/Mop1 and al-mum2. None of the 288 progeny kernels from the self-fertilization or the 241 kernels from the outcross showed excision of Mu1 from a1-mum2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> To explore this issue further, we used a more sensitive assay, reactivation of somatic excision of a reporter Mu1 element. Plants that lacked full-length MuDR elements and that were homozygous for Mop1-2EMS (the EMS-induced allele of Mop1) were crossed to plants homozygous for a single MuDR element that had been silenced using MuKiller (see Materials and Methods within this Example for details of the cross). The resulting plants were either self-fertilized, or crossed to plants homozygous for a1-mum2, and Mop1-2EMS. The resulting ears were screened for the appearance of spotted kernels. If Mop1-2EMS could activate the silenced MuDR elements, 2.34% of the progeny kernels from the self fertilizations, or 6.25% of the test cross progeny kernels would be expected to have excisions. Twenty-two families constisting of a total of 6,324 progeny kernels resulting from self-fertilization were examined. The expected number of spotted kernels in these families was 148 (see Materials and Methods within this Example for calculation). Three families with a total of 710 kernels generated from out crosses to a1-mum2 testers were also examined. If MuDR elements were reactivated by Mop1-2EMS, we would have expected to see 45 spotted kernels in these families. None were observed in any of these families, indicating no reactivation of the silenced MuDR element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> To determine if reactivation could occur in a subsequent generation, one family segregating for both the Mop1-2EMS mutation and a single silenced MuDR element was planted, subjected to DNA gel blot analysis, and out-crossed. Nine plants from this family were examined. Four of the nine plants contained hypomethylated Mu1 elements, consistent with good penetrance of this aspect of the Mop1-2EMS phenotype. Using a probe flanking the single MuDR element in this family, the presence of MuDR was confirmed in five of the nine plants (data not shown). Two plants carried both hypomethylated Mu1 elements (Mop1-2EMS homozygotes) and the previously silent MuDR element. One of these plants died. The other was self-fertilized and out crossed to a plant that was Mop1-1/Mop1 and al-mum2. None of the 288 progeny kernels from the self-fertilization or the 241 kernels from the outcross showed excision of Mu1 from a1-mum2. These results indicate that even two generations of exposure to Mop1 mutations is insufficient to reactivate the silenced, but hypomethylated MuDR element in this genetic background. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> To determine whether or not MuK, which may have been in this lineage, was contributing to the continued repression of Mu1 somatic excision, despite the presence of mop1-2EMS, an additional generation was examined. Even if MuK had been homozygous in the original plant, two generations of out crossing would result in half of the progeny lacking MuK. Therefore, fifty pale seeds of the 241 seeds from the first outcross described above were planted. DNA from the resulting 45 plants was isolated and subjected to DNA gel blot analysis, which confirmed that half of the plants (23) carried the MuDR element at position p1 MuDR(p1). Slightly less than one half (18) were homozygous for mop1-2EMS mutant. DNA blot analyses demonstrated that the Mu1 elements in all of the mop 1-2EMS homozygous plants were hypomethylated relative to their wild type siblings. None of the wild type plants carried any hypomethylated Mu1 elements. One fifth of the plants (8) were homozygous for both mop1-2EMS and had MuDR at the p1 position. These plants were outcrossed again to plants that were heterozygous for mop1-2EMS and homozygous for a1-mum2 and R-g. Importantly, some of the progeny kernels of the plants that had been homozygous mop1-2EMS homozygous and that carried MuDR(p1) showed Mu1 excision from the a1-mum2 allele. Of six ears from plants with this genotype, four ears had some spotted kernels (a total of 29 of 642 kernels were spotted). The excision frequency in these kernels was variable, ranging from only a few excisions per kernel to a frequency typical for a single active MuDR element. In contrast, in 13 ears generated from plants that were heterozygous for mop1-2EMS and that carried MuDR(p1) there were no spotted kernels out of a total of 3309 pale kernels. Similarly, in 9 ears generated from plants that were homozygous for mop1-2EMS but which lacked MuDR(p1) there were no spotted kernels out of 1900 pale kernels, and in five ears generated from plants that were heterozygous for mop1-2EMS and that lacked MuDR(p1), there were no spotted kernels out of 989 pale kernels. The presence of spotted kernels only in the plants homozygous for mop1-2EMS and carrying MuDR(p1), strongly suggests that contamination by pollen carrying active MuDR is an unlikely explanation for the spotted kernels. Based on these data, we conclude that in the absence of MuK, and after two generations of exposure of mop1-2EMS, this mutation can cause reactivation of silenced MuDR elements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> All stocks contain dominant, functional alleles for all genes required for the production of anthocyanin pigments in seedling and anther tissues unless otherwise noted. Pistillate parents used for the mutagenesis experiment had the following pI1 and r1 genotypes: PI&prime;; R-r or R-r/R-g. Staminate parents for the mutagenesis experiment were originally obtained from the Maize Cooperation Stock Center (Urbana, Ill.; accession no. 611A: PI-Rh sm1; R-r). The salmon silks 1 locus is 10 cM distal to pI1. The recessive sm1 allele confers salmon colored silks when homozygous and thus provides a linked morphological marker to PI-Rh. The PI&prime; testers used for initial crosses with putative mutants were obtained via spontaneous paramutation of PI-Rh (Hollick et al. 1995). A632 (pI-A632; R-r), A619 (pI-A619; R-g) and W22 (pI-W22; R-g) inbred material was obtained from the USDA North Central Plant Introduction Station, (Ames, Iowa). Additional W22 stocks (pI-W22; R-r:standard) were provided by Jerry Kermicle (Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison). Five PI-Rh/PI-Rh tester stocks of different genetic backgrounds were used in crosses to determine whether or not mutant plants carried paramutagenic PI&prime; alleles. Material for pI1 RNA measurements was produced by crossing plants homozygous for the given EMS-derived mutation by sibling plants heterozygous for the same mutations. Additional details of the specific genetic stocks used for these experiments are available upon request. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> Pollen pooled from multiple tassels was treated with EMS and applied to silks according to Neuffer and Coe (1978). Pistillate parents were derived from two related PI&prime;/PI&prime; families. Both families together yielded 345 ears with an average of 49 kernels per ear. Germination frequency was approximately 77% for the first 7500 M1 seed planted. A total of 9000 M1 seedlings were screened for dominant mutations affecting pigment production. Seedlings were grown in potting flats at an approximate density of 100 per sq ft. Approximately 1000 M1 plants were grown to maturity and self-pollinations of M1 plants generated 495 M2 families. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0349" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0349&rsqb;</number> Hand pollinations were used for all genetic crosses. Material for the sm1, rmr1 cosegregation test was derived by crossing a single plant heterozygous for ems136 and homozygous sm1 to a plant homozygous for ems235 but heterozygous for the recessive sm1 allele. The following syntheses and analyses were used to generate material to test the effects of the EMS-derived mutations on neutral pI1 alleles. Plants heterozygous for a given mutation (PI&prime; anthers) were crossed to both the A632 inbred line and a W22 line (obtained from J. Kermicle, Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison) containing the weakly expressed pI1 alleles pI-A632 and pI-W22 respectively. The pI-A632, pI-W22, and PI-Rh alleles are all distinct based on RFLP analyses (J. Hollick, unpublished). F1 plants were either self pollinated (A632 material) or backcrossed to plants homozygous for the given mutation (W22 material). F2 (A632 material) and BC1 (W22 material) progeny were grown to maturity. The p11 genotypes of all plants in the F2 and BC1 families were determined using RFLP gel blot analysis as previously described (Hollick et al. 1995). Anther phenotypes of all homozygous pI-A632 F2 plants were photographed for later comparison. All homozygous pI-A632 F2 plants were crossed to plants heterozygous for the given EMS-induced mutation to determine whether the F2 plants were also homozygous for the given EMS-induced mutation. Two F2 plants were identified that were homozygous pI-A632 by RFLP analysis and homozygous for rmr1-1 by testcross analysis and five F2 plants were identified that were homozygous pI-A632 by RFLP analysis and homozygous for rmr2-1 by testcross analysis. Examination of the anther photographs did not indicate any pigment differences between A632 inbred anthers or any F2 pI-A632 plants regardless of whether or not they carried the EMS-induced mutations. The BC1 plants that were PI&prime;/pI-W22 were self pollinated and also crossed to plants heterozygous for a given EMS-induced mutation to identify BC1 plants that were also homozygous for EMS-induced mutations. Anther pigmentation of pI-W22/pI-W22; rmr1-1/rmr1-1 and pI-W22/pI-W22; rmr2-1/rmr2-1 plants was weak and not obviously different from the anther pigmentation of heterozygous siblings or grandparental W22 plants. </paragraph>

A total of 495 M2 families were subsequently generated by self pollination of M1 plants to screen for recessive mutations. Small M2 families (30 seeds each) were grown for 14-18 days and then visually examined for germination frequencies and unusual morphological phenotypes. Table 5 outlines the frequency of mutant phenotypes identified. Observed mutation frequencies are similar with previous EMS-pollen mutageneses (Neuffer 1978) indicating that our chemical mutagenesis was highly efficient in producing new maize mutations. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> Because the primary leaf sheath of PI&prime;/PI-Rh seedlings is normally weakly pigmented (Hollick et al. 1995), dominant EMS-induced mutations that either release PI&prime; from a repressed expression state or prohibit the establishment of paramutation might be expected to confer fully colored M1 seedling phenotypes. Sixteen out of 9000 M1 seedlings examined were fully colored. However, no flowering plants from these 16 fully colored seedlings had fully colored, PI-Rh-like, anthers. This result indicates that our seedling screen for dominant mutations affecting anther pigmentation has an approximate 0.2% false-positive rate. In addition, none of the approximately 1000 M1 plants grown to maturity had a PI-Rh phenotype. Thus, no dominant mutations affecting either the establishment of pI1 paramutation or the maintenance of PI&prime; repression were identified out of 10,000 M1 plants tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> Genetic Screens Identified Recessive Mutations Affecting Seedling and Anther Pigmentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> Recessive mutations that release PI&prime; from a repressed expression state might also be expected to confer fully colored seedling phenotypes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>). Our M2 screen, identified five families (nos. 60, 96, 136, 235, 240) that segregated fully colored seedlings to weakly colored seedlings in the following ratios (60, 4:23; 96, 1:29; 136, 6:24; 235, 3:25; 240, 8:16). In four of five families, fully colored seedlings gave rise to mature plants with fully pigmented PI-Rh-like anthers (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</cross-reference>). Material from family 60 was dropped from further analyses because plants from fully colored seedlings in family 60 did not have fully pigmented anthers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> Genetic segregation tests indicated that the PI-Rh-like phenotypes seen in three of the M2 families (nos. 96, 136, and 235) were heritable as single locus recessive traits. Plants with fully colored anthers derived from the three M2 families were first crossed with PI&prime;/PI&prime; plants to complement the putative recessive mutations. All F1 plants from these crosses had a clear PI&prime; phenotype (family 96, 35/35; family 136, 36/36; family 235, 36/36) indicating that the putative mutations affecting seedling and anther color are recessive. F1 plants from families 96,136 and 235 were self pollinated to recover the fully colored seedling and anther trait. In all three cases, fully colored anther phenotypes were recovered at roughly a 1:3 ratio in F2 families (Table 6) consistent with the interpretation that PI-Rh-like phenotypes are due to single locus recessive mutations. As expected, subsequent crosses between mutant plants and heterozygous siblings gave rise to families in which the mutant and normal phenotypes approximated a 1:1 ratio (family 96, 231:272; family 136, 100:88; family 235, 111:125).

<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Genetic complementation was tested in pair-wise combinations among the four EMS-induced mutations and also with the recessive a3-Styles allele (Styles and Coe 1986) and the recessive Mop1-1 allele (Dorweiler et al. 2000). Specific EMS-induced mutations were designated according to the family in which they were identified: ems96, ems136, ems235 and ems240. For each mutation, plants heterozygous for a given mutation (PI&prime; anthers or lightly colored plant in the case of a3-Styles heterozygotes) were individually crossed by plants homozygous for a different allele (PI-Rh-like anthers or darkly colored plants in the case of a3-Styles homozygotes). Anther pigment phenotypes of progeny from these crosses were quantified (Table 7) on a 1-7 graded Anther Color Score (ACS) where ACS 7 corresponds to the fully colored PI-Rh phenotype (Hollick et al. 1995). Based on these results, mutations ems136 and ems235 fail to complement and thus define a single locus, ems240 is allelic to Mop1-1, and ems96 defines a third locus. Further description of the ems240 allele, designated Mop1-2EMS, is provided in Example 1.

<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> EMS-Derived Mutations Allow Increased Expression of pI1 RNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> We used RNase-protection experiments to compare pI1 RNA levels from anthers of PI&prime;/PI&prime; plants either homozyogus or heterozygous for the ems136, ems235, or ems96 alleles. Using actin RNA as a control, pI1 RNA levels were 26, 14, and nine fold greater in homozygous ems136, ems235 and ems96 mutants versus heterozygous siblings, respectively (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18B and 18C</cross-reference>). These increases in pI1 RNA due to the ems136 mutation occur in the absence of any changes in the transcription rate of the pI1 gene. In vitro transcription reactions using isolated husk nuclei (see example 1), demonstrate that both pI1 and b1 transcription rates remain unchanged while al transcription is increased 4-fold in homozygous ems136 plants (5 independent experiments) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>). However, the pI1 RNA increases due to the ems235 mutation occur with concomitant increases in p11 transcription rates. In vitro transcription reactions using isolated husk nuclei (see example 1), demonstrate that pI1 transcription rates are increased 2.5-fold in homozygous ems235 plants (5 independent experiments) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>). The b1 transcription rate remains unchanged and the al transcription rate is increased 5-fold. These results indicate that the normal functions of these genes identified by mutations are required to maintain repression of pI1 RNA accumulation. The transcription assays imply that there are both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in maintaining the repression of paramutant PI&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> Genes Affecting Repression of PI&prime; Encode Trans-Acting Factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> Both Mop1 and the locus defined by the ems96 allele genetically map to chromosome 2 whereas the pI1 locus is found on chromosome 6. Alleles that define the other locus (ems136 and ems235) failed to cosegregate with a genetic marker closely linked to the pI1 locus. The salmon silks 1 (sm1) locus, located 10 cM distal to pI1, normally conditions yellow maize silks but plants that are homozygous for the recessive sm1 allele (sm1) have salmon-colored silks. Genetic crosses were used to ask whether the fully-colored anther phenotype found in homozygous mutant plants cosegregated with the recessive sm1 allele. A total of 6/15 (40%) segregant plants with fully-colored anthers were sm1/sm1 and 9/21 (42%) plants with weakly-colored anthers were sm1/sm1. The lack of strong cosegregation between the fully-colored anther phenotype and recessive alleles of the sm1 locus indicates that the locus defined by the ems136 and ems235 alleles is distinct from the pI1 locus. Thus all three loci identified in our genetic screen define trans-acting genetic factors affecting pI1 RNA accumulation in PI&prime;/PI&prime; plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> All Three Loci Identified by Mutation Encode Factors Required to Maintain Heritable Repression of PI&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> The fully-colored phenotypes of seedlings and anthers together with the increases in pI1 RNA seen when the EMS-derived mutations are homozygous suggested that PI&prime; may have changed to a PI-Rh state. Plants homozygous for Mop1-1 sometimes show heritable changes of PI&prime; to PI-Rh. To test mutations at the other two loci, mutant plants with fully-colored anthers were crossed to a series of PJ-Rh/PI-Rh testers and the anther phenotypes of the progeny were quantified. If PI&prime; heritably changes to PI-Rh in plants homozygous for the ems136, ems235, or ems96 alleles then fully-colored PI-Rh phenotypes should be found in the resulting progeny. If PI&prime; does not heritably change to PI-Rh, then only PI&prime; phenotypes would be found in the progeny (Hollick et al. 1995). Results of these crosses (Table 8) indicate that while PI&prime; can be transmitted, PI&prime; often changes to a meiotically-heritable PI-Rh state in plants homozygous for the ems136, ems235 or ems96 alleles. We have designated these new loci &ldquo;rmr&rdquo; for required to maintain repression to reflect the necessity of rmr functions for maintaining PI&prime; in a mitotically- and meiotically-heritable repressed state. The ems136 and ems235 alleles together define the rmr1 locus and are designated rmr1-1 and rmr1-2 respectively. The ems96 allele defines the rmr2 locus and is designated rmr2-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> PI&prime; most frequently changed to a non-paramutagenic (PI-Rh) state in plants homozygous for either the rmr1-1 or rmr1-2 alleles (Table 8). Approx. 70% of crosses between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and plants homozygous for either the rmr1-1 or rmr1-2 allele produced at least one progeny plant having a PI-Rh anther phenotype compared to only 22% of similar testcrosses with plants homozygous for the rmr2-1 allele. This difference may partially relate to observations showing that different PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers themselves have different frequencies of spontaneous paramutation; PI-Rh can spontaneously change to PI&prime; in the absence of PI&prime; (Hollick et al. 1995). To control for such differences, PI-Rh/PI-Rh pollen collected from a single plant was used to pollinate rmr1-1 and rmr2-1 homozygous plants. Both sets of crosses produced at least one progeny plant with a PI-Rh phenotype indicating that both rmr1-1 and rmr2-1 mutations can allow meiotically-heritable derepression of PI&prime;. However, proportionally more PI-Rh-like progeny were derived from crosses made with homozygous rmr1-1 plants (Table 9). In addition, progeny plants had higher Anther Color Scores from the rmr1-1 crosses relative to the rmr2-1 crosses suggesting that PI&prime; alleles are, in general, less paramutagenic when transmitted through plants homozygous for rmr1-1 as compared to rmr2-1 (Tables 8 and 9). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> Given that PI&prime; could sometimes change to a meiotically-heritable PI-Rh state in either homozygous rmr1-1 and rmr2-1 plants, we asked whether such newly changed PI&prime; alleles, formally designated PI(&prime;), were distinguishable from a naive PI-Rh allele. It was possible that PI(&prime;) might retain residual paramutagenic activity relative to PI-Rh. A cosegregation test using linked sm1 markers was used to show that a PI(&prime;) allele transmitted from a either a rmr1-1 or rmr2-1 homozygote was indistinguishable from naive PI-Rh in terms of its paramutagenicity (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>). Thus, both RMR1 and RMR2 functions contribute to the meiotically heritable maintenance of the paramutagenic PI&prime; state. In the absence of RMR1 or RMR2 function, PI&prime; always has a somatic expression phenotype indistinguishable from PI-Rh but this does not ensure that PI&prime; always changes to a meiotically-heritable PI-Rh state.

<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> We addressed the possibility that rmr functions generally affect all pI1 alleles by combining neutral pI1 alleles with either the rmr1-1 or rmr2-1 alleles and examining the anther phenotypes. The neutral pI-A632 and pI-W22 alleles confer weak, sunlight-dependent, pigmentation to the anthers. Anthers of plants homozygous for the pI-A632 or pI-W22 alleles had visibly identical levels of pigmentation regardless of whether or not the plants were homozygous for a rmr mutation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>) implying that RMR1 and RMR2 functions specifically affect the expression of paramutant PI&prime; alleles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> Heritable Changes of PI&prime; to PI-Rh in rmr1 Mutants are Unaffected by Mode of Sexual Transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> Given that male and female gametes are often differentially imprinted in plants (Kermicle and Alleman 1980; Vielle-Calzada et al. 2000) and they arise at different times and locations during development, we wondered whether meiotically-heritable changes of PI&prime; to PI-Rh occurred with equal frequencies in the two separate somatic cell lineages or whether there were gametophyte-specific effects. This possibility was addressed using reciprocal crosses between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and plants homozygous for the rmr1-1 allele. Pollen from PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers was placed on receptive silks of PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr1-1/rmr1-1 plants and vice versa. Plants derived from seven reciprocal crosses were grown to maturity and the Anther Color Scores determined (Table 10). When all the data are combined, the same frequency of PI-Rh progeny was observed when PI&prime; was transmitted through either female or male gametes. When each reciprocal cross was examined, three sets of families had very similar frequencies. Frequencies for the remaining four sets of families varied 1.5 to two fold but there was no sex-specific trend. The frequencies of PI&prime; to PI-Rh changes observed between individual rmr1-1/rmr1-1 plants could vary as much as six fold but the frequencies observed within each pair of reciprocal crosses varied no more than two fold. Thus, the frequency of heritable PI&prime; to PI-Rh changes in rmr1-1 homozygotes appears to be intrinsic to each individual sporophyte and is not differentially affected by female versus male gametophyte development.

<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> rmr1 and rmr2 Mutants do not Appear to Affect Plant Development. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> Although mutations in Mop1 can lead to a wide range of developmentally abnormal phenotypes (Example 1) we have not observed grossly abnormal phenotypes in homozygous rmr1 and rmr2 mutant plants. We began this series of observations by first generating F1 individuals between A632 inbred plants and plants homozygous for either rmr1-1, rmr1-2 or rmr2-1 and then examining the F2 homozygous mutants derived from self pollination. This strategy was adopted to reduce the number of other unlinked EMS-induced mutations that might potentially affect plant morphology. Of the 200 rmr F2 plants segregating for each rmr mutation, all plants that had a fully-colored anther phenotype were otherwise similar in stature, morphology, and flowering time to sibling plants. F2 families generated using the rmr mutations and both the A619 and W22 inbred lines gave identical results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> Further generations of inbreeding did not produce abnormal plants. Several rmr F2 plants (A632 background) with fully-colored anthers that had a PI-Rh/PI-Rh RFLP genotype were self pollinated and also outcrossed to PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers. All F3 plants from the self pollinations had fully-colored anthers but were otherwise similar in all other respects to testcross progeny. F4 plants derived by self pollination of homozygous rmr1-1 F3 plants were also normal in appearance and similar in all respects to the previous F3 plants. A single F3 plant homozygous for rmr2-1 was crossed to a rmr2-1 heterozygote from a separate lineage to generate a family where rmr2-1 homozygotes and heterozygotes could be compared. Aside from differences in anther pigmentation, rmr2-1 homozygotes were indistinguishable from their heterozygous siblings. Although it remains possible that prolonged exposure of the genome to defects in RMR1 and RMR2 functions could have pleiotropic consequences, we currently have no indications that they are required for proper plant development, at least in the A632, A619, or W22 backgrounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> rmr1 and rmr2 Mutations Prevent Mu Element Methylation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> Given the observation that Mop1 affects both paramutation and Mu methylation (Example 2), we were curious to see if the rmr mutations did the same. Because the background in which the rmr mutations was isolated lacked full length MuDR elements (data not shown), it was possible to directly observe the effect of these mutations on endogenous Mu1 elements in the absence of the transposase. DNA from three families that were segregating 1:1 for homozygous mutant and heterozygous siblings was analyzed for the methylation status of Mu1 sequences (see Example 2 for details). Four of four rmr1-1/rmr1-1 plants had unmethylated Mu1 sequences while four of seven rmr1-1&plus; plants had clearly methylated Mu1 sequences (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</cross-reference>). The other three rmr1-1&plus; plants did not have methylated Mu1 sequences (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32A</cross-reference>). The correlation between Mu1 methylation and rmr2-1 genotypes was perfect; eight of eight rmr2-1/rmr2-1 plants had no detectable Mu1 methylation and 10/10 rmr2-11&plus; plants had heavily methylated Mu1 sequences (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32B</cross-reference>). These results strongly suggest that Mu element hypomethylation is a generic effect of mutations affecting paramutation rather than a specific effect of Mop1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> Summary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> Using a seedling-based genetic screen, we identified three maize loci (Mop1, rmr1 and rmr2) whose trans-acting functions are required to maintain gene silencing that occurs as the result of paramutation at the pI1 locus. In all plants homozygous for mutations in Mop1, rmr1, or rmr2, PI&prime; is expressed at a high level indistinguishable from PI-Rh (Example 1). While the reduced expression state (PI&prime;) is most frequently restored upon outcrossing to non-mutant plants, an increased expression state indistinguishable from PI-Rh can be meiotically heritable. Because pI1 paramutation is associated with changes in pI1 transcription, our working model is that RMR1, RMR2, and MOP1 functions are involved with the maintenance of specific chromatin structures that prohibit high levels of pI1 transcription. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> Additional rmr loci are clearly involved in PI&prime; repression. Our reported genetic screen represents only 10% theoretical saturation. This estimate is based on the apparent mutation rate of one detectable hit per gene per 1000 genomes screened and the roughly 95% probability that 5000 screened genomes would yield at least one detectable mutation in every given gene. These numbers suggest that six to ten such rmr-like loci exist in maize. Indeed, five additional rmr loci have already been identified in ongoing genetic screens (see Example 6, J. Hollick, unpublished). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> Paramutation silencing at the pI1 locus not only leads to repression of PI-Rh expression, it also affects the way in which the PI-Rh allele is regulated (Hollick et al. 2000). PI-Rh expression is light-insensitive while PI&prime; expression is light-dependent. As most pI1 alleles are regulated by light cues, the observations that rmr1 and rmr2 mutations have no effect on pI-A632 or pI-W22 suggests that RMR functions do not mediate light-induction. Rather, we hypothesize that RMR functions are used in maintaining a specific regulatory state unique to PI&prime;. The PI-Rh state then must actively prevent or avoid RMR action. Two general and non-exclusive modes of action are considered: 1) rmr RNA or proteins are components of a heritable chromatin structure that affects pI1 transcription, 2) RMR functions facilitate alterations or maintenance of a heritable chromatin structure. Previous work has shown that paramutant pI1 and r1 alleles require continued allelic interactions with another paramutant or paramutagenic partner (Styles and Brink 1968; Hollick and Chandler 1998). It is possible that RMR functions actually mediate these allelic interactions through homology searching or specifying intranuclear positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> It is not known whether the rmr mutations described represent complete loss-of-function alleles. In fact, the observation that pI1 RNA levels are significantly lower in homozygous rmr1-2 plants versus rmr1-1 plants hints that the two alleles have different levels of activity. Nonetheless, mutations at both the rmr1 and rmr2 loci are completely recessive suggesting that neither RMR1 or RMR2 functions are dosage sensitive as are many of the genes required to mediate examples of position effect variegation seen in Drosophila (reviewed in Weiler and Wakimoto 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> Despite similar effects on pI1 RNA levels, the frequency of meiotically-heritable PI&prime; to PI-Rh changes is clearly different in the rmr1 mutants versus rmr2-1 mutants. Even in rmr1-2 homozygotes where the relative level of pI1 RNA is lower than in rmr2-1 homozygotes, PI&prime; changes to a PI-Rh state more frequently in homozygous rmr1-2 plants. This set of results implies that derepression of PI&prime; in somatic tissues is, by itself, insufficient to allow a meiotically-heritable change of PI&prime; to PI-Rh. In addition to PI&prime; heritably changing to PI-Rh more frequently in rmr1 mutant plants, those alleles that remain PI&prime; upon transmission appear to be less paramutagenic than those transmitted from rmr2-1 mutant plants. One interpretation is that RMR1 and RMR2 functions are distinct in terms of their role(s) in maintaining meiotically-heritable repression of PI&prime;. This idea is supported by the finding that rmr1-1 leads to loss of a post-transcriptional regulatory step while rmr2-1 leads to loss of a transcriptional-based mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> Although PI&prime; heritably changes to PI-Rh at different frequencies between individual rmr1-1/rmr1-1 plants, similar frequencies were observed independent of female versus male transmission in several reciprocal crosses (Table 10). In these families, the frequency of meiotically heritable changes of PI&prime; to PI-Rh was established early in development prior to the point that cell lineages diverged to specify the lateral versus apical infloresence meristems. Frequencies of heritable PI&prime; to PI-Rh changes were distinct, however, between each set of reciprocal crosses. This observation implies that different frequencies can be established and maintained through most of sporophyte development with relatively high fidelity. It remains unclear as to whether PI&prime; actually changes to a meiotically-heritable PI-Rh state during early development or whether the probability of such changes later in development are preset early on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> RMR1 and RMR2 functions do not appear to be involved in general gene control mechanisms required for development. To date, plants homozygous for the rmr1-1, rmr1-2 or rmr2-1 alleles have been morphologically and developmentally indistinguishable from their heterozygous siblings. This absence of morphological defects, even after three generations of selfing, suggests that rmr1 and rmr2 are unlikely to be maize orthologues of the Arabidopsis ddm1 or met1 genes. Mutations of ddm1, a SWI2/SNF-2-like gene (Jeddeloh et al. 1999), and dominant-inhibitors of met1, a DNA methyl transferase enzyme, have broad and cumulative effects on Arabidopsis development (Kakutani et al. 1996; Ronemus et al. 1996; Finnegan et al. 1996). Because mutations in Mop1 also appear to have effects on plant development (Example 1), it appears that the rmr1 and rmr2 loci define a class of genetic functions distinct from MOP1. Alternatively, RMR1 and RMR2 may participate in developmental pathways similar to MOP1 but have redundant developmental functions. Double mutant combinations are currently being synthesized to test this possibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> Several other genes required to maintain transgene silencing in Arabidopsis have been recently described. Some of these genes like sgs1, sgs2, sgs3 (suppressor of gene silencing) and sde1, sde2, sde3, and sde4 (silencing defective) are required for post-transcriptional silencing (Elmayan et al. 1998; Mourrain et al. 2000; Dalmay et al. 2000) while others, hog1 (homology-dependent gene silencing 1), sil1, sil2 (silencing), and mom1 (Morpheus&apos; molecule 1) are required for transcriptional-based silencing (Furner et al. 1998; Amedeo et al. 2000). Given that paramutation at the b1 and pI1 loci affect heritable states of transcriptional control (Patterson et al 1993; Hollick et al. 2000), the rmr genes could potentially be related to this latter class of Arabidopsis genes. Paramutation has not been described in Arabidopsis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> All plant stocks contained dominant functional alleles for all the genes encoding the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes required in vegetative plant tissues. Because transcription of these genes in vegetative plant tissues is controlled by pI1 in combination with b1 or r1, the specific b1, pI1 and r1 alleles are indicated for relevant stocks. One exception is the distinction between PI&prime;-mahogany (PI) and PI-Rhoades (PI-Rh) (Hollick et al., 1995). Many stocks possess the R-g allele of r1 (no expression in the seed or plant), which precludes reliable scoring of PI&prime; versus PI-Rh. In these stocks, we have used P/to indicate the presence of either PI-Rh, or its spontaneous derivative PI&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> A gI2 b wt, PI, R-g (inbred K55 background) stock, as well as B-I PIR-g (inbred W23 background) and B&prime; PIR-g (inbred K55 background) stock were originally obtained from E. H. Coe, Jr. (University of Missouri, Columbia). These stocks were used by V. L. Chandler to generate gI2 B&prime; wt and gI2 B-I wt stocks. To test whether Mop2-1 affects pI1 paramutation, our Mop2-1 stocks were crossed with stocks containing the R-r allele to facilitate reliable scoring of the pI1 genotype. These included a gI2 b wt, PI-Rh, R-r stock generated by V. L. Chandler, and a y1 PI&prime; sm, PRR stock originally obtained from the Maize Cooperation Stock center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> Genetic Screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> A screening population was generated by treating B&prime;, PI-Rh, R-g (inbred K55 background) pollen with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS; 0.063% as described by Neuffer and Coe, 1978), and using treated pollen to pollinate gI2 B-I wt, PI-Rh, R-g (stock generated by V. L. Chandler&mdash;mix of W23/K55 inbred stocks) ears, producing M1 seed. The gI2 and wt loci flank the b1 gene. In wild-type stocks, B&prime; will paramutate B-I, and all progeny will be light, whereas rare plants having B-q pigmentation levels may indicate the presence of a mutation preventing the establishment of paramutation. The M1 seed was planted to screen mature plants for rare individuals having B-I pigmentation levels. Presence of the recessive gI2 and wt markers in the B-I ear parent enable rapid identification of any self-pollination contaminant offspring. This is important because self-contaminants would yield the desired rare phenotype of B-I pigment levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> Over 7300 M1 seed was planted in the summer of 1993. One exceptional darkly-pigmented individual was identified (KK1238-1). This individual was self-pollinated, and outcrossed to several tester stocks (gI2 B-I wt, gI2 B&prime; wt, and gI2 b wt). The results of these and subsequent crosses (detailed below) demonstrated that KK1238-1 carried a heritable dominant mutation capable of inhibiting B-I paramutation. This dominant mutation has been designated Mop2-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> Many of the M1 plants (other than KK1238-1) that showed a B&prime; phenotype were self-pollinated, and M2 families were screened in sand benches for the presence of rare darkly-pigmented seedlings resembling B-I-like plants among siblings that were essentially green. One family (KKI 191-1X) segregated &frac14; darkly-pigmented plants suggesting the presence of a recessive mutation. Dark and light individuals along with appropriate testers were transplanted. Another &tilde;100 families were screened, but no other mutations were found. Crosses were performed with the new putative mutant to test for heritability, bulk up seed and begin complementation tests with other mutants such as those described in Example 1 and Example 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> Molecular Markers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> Map position of the Mop2-1 mutation was confirmed using simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers. A large number of these PCR-based markers are available for maize (http://www.agron.missouri.edu/ssr.html). The SSR markers that are tightly linked to Mop2-1 and were used to follow Mop2-1 segregation are bnlg1017, bnlg1338 and umc1823. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> 2. Identification and Characterization of a Dominant Mutation, Mop2-1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> The facts that B&prime; is extremely stable and that paramutation always occurs when B&prime; and B-I are brought together in a heterozygous individual enable a simple genetic screen to identify mutations involved in paramutation. B&prime; pollen was treated with the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and used to pollinate gI2 B-I wt ears. The gI2 wt recessive marker loci, which flank the b1 gene, enable the identification and elimination of any gI2 B-I wt pollen self-contaminants, and can also be used to follow chromosome 2 segregation in subsequent generations. Over 7300 M1 seed were grown to maturity and screened for dark plants that may carry a dominant mutation that disrupts the establishment of paramutation. One exceptional dark plant was recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> A series of crosses were done to confirm the presence of a heritable mutation and further characterize its behavior. This exceptional dark plant was crossed to a gI2 B&prime; wt tester plant, and all 15 B&prime; progeny were subsequently crossed to gI2 B-I wt to determine which individuals carried the dominant mutation capable of inhibiting paramutation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>). To determine whether this dominant mutation identifies an independent locus involved in paramutation, or a mutation in the B&prime; allele which abolishes its paramutagenic properties, we tested for co-segregation of the mutation with the B&prime; allele. The B&prime; allele originating from the EMS treated pollen was flanked by wild-type alleles of the gI2 and wt loci (GI2 and Wt), whereas the B-I allele carried the recessive gI2 wt markers. These markers were used to separate progeny of the above cross with gI2 B&prime; wt into those inheriting the GI/2 B&prime; Wt chromosome, and those inheriting the gI2 B-I wt chromosome (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>). One individual was recombinant in the gI2 wt interval and was therefore not informative with respect to which b1 allele had been inherited, though the presence of dark progeny in a testcross with gI2 B-I wt demonstrates that it inherited the mutation. Of six individuals inheriting the GI2 B&prime; Wt chromosome, all six gave rise to dark progeny when crossed to gI2 B-I wt consistent with each of them carrying the dominant mutation. If the mutation were unlinked to b1, we would expect that only half of these individuals would inherit the dominant mutation and give dark progeny in the next generation. The likelihood that all six individuals would inherit an unlinked mutation by chance is small (p&equals;0.016), therefore it is most likely that the mutation is linked to b1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> To further determine whether this linked mutation is disrupted in the B&prime; allele or in a linked but independent locus, the progeny of these six individuals were further examined. Given the fact that a double recombination event separating the B&prime; allele from its flanking GI2 and Wt markers would be quite rare, if the mutation is at B&prime; we would expect that all GI2 Wt progeny would be dark and all gI2 wt progeny should be light. This expectation was not met. Eleven percent of the gI2 wt progeny were dark, and 12.5% of the GI2 Wt progeny were light. These results are most consistent with the mutation residing outside the gI2 wt interval and thus independent of the b1 locus. The fact that GI2 wt recombinant progeny inherited the mutation (dark plants) and gI2 Wt recombinant progeny did not (light plants) demonstrates that the mutation lies distal to the gI2 locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> As additional confirmation of this conclusion, nine progeny of the same original cross to gI2 B&prime; wt (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>) inherited the gI2 B-I wt chromosome, though as described above, all nine were light (B&prime; phenotype) confirming that the B-I allele was still paramutable. These nine individuals were testcrossed to additional gI2 B-I wt tester stocks to determine whether they carried the dominant mutation. Consistent with the mutation residing on the homologous chromosome, seven of these individuals did not carry the mutation and gave all light progeny, whereas two individuals gave dark progeny indicating they had inherited the linked mutation, but that it must reside outside the gI2 wt interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> Thus, this mutation identifies a locus, distinct from b1, which appears to play a role in paramutation. Based upon subsequent analyses described below which reveal similarities with the recessive mediator of paramutation 1 mutations, we have designated this locus mediator of paramutation 2, and the mutation Mop2-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> 3. Penetrance of Mop2-1 vs. Spontaneous Paramutation of B-I. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> Though segregation of the mutation could be followed by the presence of dark progeny, the frequency of dark progeny in some of the above crosses was less than predicted. In crosses of BVB&prime; Mop2-1/mop2&times;B-I/B-I mop2/mop2, 50% of progeny should be dark because they inherit the Mop2-1 mutation, yet in some families the frequency of dark progeny was much lower (30-35%). One possible interpretation is that Mop2-1 is not fully penetrant in preventing paramutation. Another possibility is that the B-I allele of the tester plants is spontaneously paramutating to B&prime; on a stochastic basis. Spontaneous changes of B-I to B&prime; occur regularly in both standard and Mop2-1 stocks, and could easily account for the discrepancy (35% observed vs. 50% expected) observed in some families. Plants in which this occurs would be light even though they carry Mop2-1. Consistent with this interpretation is the fact that spontaneous paramutation of B-I to B&prime; occurs in wild-type stocks, and often occurs more frequently in some families than others. The distribution of color scores among the progeny of 9 individuals that carried the Mop2-1 mutation are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. Color scores were used as many individuals did not fall into clear categories of light or dark, but rather had intermediate phenotypes. Color scores of 1-3 are typical of a B&prime; individual, and 6-7 are typical of a B-I individual. Both sheaths and tassels were scored. Some families gave a clearly bimodal distribution of color scores with approximately 1:1 B-I to B&prime; progeny (e.g. Families 4, 5, 7). Other families gave considerably more intermediate individuals (color scores of 4-5, e.g. Families 2, 6, 8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> The fact that B&prime; Mop2-1/mop2&times;B-I individuals inheriting Mop2-1 can be light is also apparent in the fact that two light progeny of the original dark plant inherited recombinant gI2 B-I wt chromosomes carrying Mop2-1. These progeny were light upon outcross to gI2 B&prime; wt, consistent with either incomplete penetrance of the mutation or spontaneous paramutation of the B-I allele, but the presence of Mop2-1 was established upon outcrossing each individual to gI2 B-I wt and observing dark progeny. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> Mop2-1 also Prevents the Establishment of p11 Paramutation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> To determine whether mop2 can affect additional paramutable loci in trans or is restricted to the linked b1 locus, we tested whether it could inhibit the establishment of pI1 paramutation. We crossed an individual heterozygous for the Mop2-1 mutation with a stock homozygous for the PI-Rh and R-r alleles. All progeny from this cross had fully-pigmented anthers (PI-Rh) which enabled us to confirm that the PI-Rh allele in the Mop2-1 plant had not spontaneously changed to PI&prime;. Progeny of this cross, half of which should carry the Mop2-1 mutation, were crossed with a paramutagenic PI&prime; stock. Two of these individuals gave progeny segregating 1:1 for dark (PI-Rh) and light (PI) anthered plants suggesting they carried the Mop2-1 mutation, whereas a third individual gave all PI&prime; progeny consistent with the parent individual lacking the Mop2-1 mutation. The presence of dark-anthered progeny demonstrates that the Mop2-1 mutation is able to inhibit the establishment of pI1 paramutation. The 1:1 segregation ratio (total for both families 17:18) observed among the progeny further suggests that the Mop2-1 mutation is fully penetrant with respect to the inhibition of pI1 paramutation. This observation, together with the fact that some crosses with B-I yield 1:1 segregation ratios, suggests that the Mop2-1 mutation is fully penetrant and that instances in which less than 50% darks are observed are more easily explained by spontaneous paramutation of B-I to B&prime;. These results are also consistent with observations that B-I is less stable than PI-Rh, i.e. more likely to undergo spontaneous paramutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> Phenotype of Homozygous Mop2-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> To determine whether this mutation represents a true dominant or a semi-dominant allele, we have generated homozygous mutant individuals. Though the original exceptional dark individual in the M1 screening population had been self-pollinated in an effort to generate individuals homozygous for the mutation, nearly all progeny of this self-pollination were unhealthy or failed to thrive such that testcrosses for the identification of homozygous individuals were difficult to obtain. This is presumably due to the presence of additional mutations resulting from the EMS mutagenesis that become homozygous in the M2 progeny. Instead, we took advantage of the fact that Mop2-1 heterozygous individuals resulting from the pI1 experiments described above were considerably more vigorous than previously identified Mop2-1 stocks, presumably due to hybrid vigor from multiple outcrosses to distinct genetic stocks. Several of the heterozygous Mop2-1 individuals identified by the presence of dark red anthers were self-pollinated. Progeny (B&prime;) were self-pollinated and testcrossed to B-I to determine their mop2 genotype. All 13 testcross progeny of one individual possessed the B-I phenotype, indicating that the parent had been homozygous for the Mop2-1 mutation. Progeny from the self-pollination of this individual were grown in our winter nursery in Hawaii. Progeny from the self-pollinations of two sibling individuals shown to be heterozygous for the Mop2-1 mutation were also grown as a control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> Plants of these self-pollinations were initially scored about 2 weeks prior to anthesis. No obvious phenotypic differences were noted at that time, though the progeny of the homozygous individual were somewhat less vigorous than most progeny of the heterozygous individuals. As the progeny of the homozygous Mop2-1 individual approached anthesis, they darkened. Progeny from the self-pollinations of two heterozygous Mop2-1 individuals showed two phenotypic classes: several individuals were lightly pigmented and quite vigorous, some of which were already flowering; whereas a few individuals were spindly, much later flowering, and somewhat darker than their sibs. Furthermore, some additional individuals were less than half the height of their sibs, quite spindly, and showed no hope of producing an ear. Among the slightly darker progeny of the heterozygous individuals, and the progeny of the homozygous individual, were some individuals showing a tassel-seed phenotype. Over the next week or two, some of these individuals continued to darken such that some approached a B-I-like phenotype (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>). Analysis of a linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) locus, and testcrosses for a majority of individuals in these families confirmed that the darker individuals were homozygous for the Mop2-1 mutation whereas the lighter sibs were heterozygous or homozygous for the wild-type allele. This difference in pigmentation correlates with increased b1 transcript levels in the homozygous Mop2-1 individuals relative to their heterozygous siblings (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0416&rsqb;</number> To determine whether the darker phenotype of the homozygous Mop2-1 individuals would result in a heritable alteration of the B&prime; allele, some of the darker homozygous individuals were also crossed to a B-Peru tester. B-Peru gives purple kernel color but extremely weak plant color such that B&prime; or B-I plant pigment is readily apparent. All progeny of this cross had typical B&prime; pigment levels, suggesting that the effect of homozygous Mop2-1 had not produced a heritable alteration of B&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0417&rsqb;</number> Mop2-1 Summary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> Mop2-1 represents a novel dominant mutation able to inhibit the establishment of paramutation at b1 and pI1. In this sense, Mop2-1 is distinct from Mop1, mop3, rmr1 and rmr2. Plants homozygous for this mutation also show recessive phenotypes such as increased pigment and b1 transcript levels, and developmental abnormalities. These recessive pigment phenotypes are similar to those observed for mutations in Mop1, mop3, rmr1 and rmr2, and the developmental abnormalities similar to mutations in Mop1, mop3 and CC2343. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> 4. Isolation and Characterization of Recessive Mutations, mop3-1 and CC2343 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0420" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0420&rsqb;</number> Two new recessive mutants were isolated in seedling and mature plant screens using B&prime;. Examples of the phenotypes are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. Both of these mutations appear to represent unique genes, which increase the RNA levels of B&prime; and mop3-1 decreases the methylation of Mu1 elements. These results indicate that the two genes identified by these mutations are required for maintenance of paramutation at B&prime; and mop3-1 and for maintenance of the hypermethylation of Mu1 elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> Isolation of mop3-1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> All but one of the M1 plants from the screen described for the isolation of Mop2-1 had a wild-type B&prime; phenotype, yet they could carry new recessive mutations. These M1 plants (other than the plant carrying the Mop2-1 mutation) were self-pollinated to generate M2 families. M2 families were screened in sand benches for the presence of rare darkly-pigmented seedlings resembling B-I-like plants among siblings that were essentially green. One family (KK1191-1X) segregated &frac14; darkly pigmented plants (example of phenotype in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</cross-reference>) suggesting the presence of a recessive mutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> The KK1191-1 family showed good penetrance of the mutant phenotype, and additional genetic tests of this mutation were performed. To bulk up the family, a plant homozygous for this mutant and homozygous for B&prime; was crossed to a plant that was homozygous for B-1. Ninety of the resulting seed were planted. Approximately 75 plants germinated; all of them had the B&prime; phenotype, consistent with the new mutation being recessive and that the B&prime; state was not heritably changed to B-I in the homozygous mutant. Several of these plants were crossed to siblings to test for heritability. In one family of 15 plants, four showed the mutant phenotype, consistent with the segregation of a single recessive mutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0424" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0424&rsqb;</number> Isolation of CC2343. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> The CC2343 mutation was isolated using a different screen as compared to that which led to the identification of the other mutations. Pollen from B&prime; plants was treated with EMS and used to pollinate B&prime; ears. A total of 1464 M1 seed were planted and screened for dark plants, which could represent a dominant mutation that relieved the silencing associated with the paramutant B&prime; state. One dark plant was observed and designated CC2343. The mutant plant made no fertile ear, so it could only be crossed as male onto testers. The only cross that produced seed was to DS1630 (b R-g PI). Thirty-four seed were obtained and planted in the spring of 2000, only 22 germinated. One of the 22 plants was dark at its base with a B&prime; phenotype in its tassel (N182-16), while the rest of the plants had the B&prime; phenotype. If the original dark plant had carried a dominant mutation that increased the expression of B, the expectation is that &frac12; the plants should have been dark. This expectation was clearly not met. Three possibilities were considered: first, the original plant did not represent a new mutation; second there was a low penetrance due to background or environmental effects; third, the original dark plant contained two unlinked mutations and both needed to be present as heterozygotes for the phenotype to be observed. A prediction of the third hypothesis is that &frac14; of the plants should have been dark because they received both unlinked mutations. This was not observed. However, approximately one-third of the seeds did not germinate (12/34), which could skew the segregation ratios. Further experiments described below demonstrate that at least one new recessive mutation is segregating in these plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> To determine if recessive mutations were present in the plants, each plant was self-pollinated and progeny planted and scored for light versus dark phenotypes. Six self-pollinated plants yielded seed, which were planted in Fall 2000. If half of the original N182 plants had carried a recessive mutation, then the expectation is that half of these six families (N268, N271, N273, N275, N276, 0136) would segregate dark plants in the next generation. One family (N268) segregated only green and light (B&prime;) plants. Five of the six familes (N271, N273, N275, N276, 0136) each produced dark (9), medium dark (9) and lightly pigmented (16) plants, as well as green plants (17; b/b genotype). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27C,D</cross-reference> illustrates these phenotypes. The medium dark plants were healthy, but the very dark plants were most often short and sickly. Only one made an ear, and most had small tassels that shed poorly. The frequency of N182 plants that gave rise to mutant progeny is more consistent with the hypothesis that two independent mutations were segregating (expected frequency 0.75), rather than the hypothesis of a single mutation present in the original isolate (0.5). However, the fact that only 6/22 plants could be tested precludes a definitive conclusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0427" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0427&rsqb;</number> Subsequent crosses have confirmed the presence of at least one mutation that increases B&prime; pigment, but the poor germination and health of these plants has made it impossible to definitively conclude whether one or two mutations are segregating in these lines based simply on segregation ratios. The medium dark plants were self-pollinated, and the medium dark and dark plants were crossed to their B&prime; siblings and outcrossed to B&prime; testers. If the dark and medium dark plants were homozygous for a recessive mutation, then the outcrosses to B&prime; testers should produce progeny uniformly CC2343/&plus;B&prime;/&minus;. Four families that resulted from dark plants crossed to B&prime; were planted and scored; all forty-two had the B&prime; phenotype, consistent with a recessive mutation, not a semi-dominant mutation, in the dark plants. In the next season both the medium dark (dark sheaths and husks, but lighter, more B&prime;-like tassel pigment; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27D</cross-reference>) and dark plants (dark pigment in sheaths, husks and tassel; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</cross-reference>) were crossed with B&prime; CC2343/&plus;. When possible they were also self-pollinated. In Fall 2001, the number of dark, medium dark and light plants were scored. Unfortunately, germination was very poor, such that statistically significant numbers of plants were not available for scoring in most families. Some families resulting from self-pollination of medium dark and dark plants produced all medium dark or dark plants, consistent with both phenotypic classes being homozygous for a mutation. However, some families resulting from dark or medium dark crosses with CC2343/&plus; produced only light plants. This could mean that there are indeed two different recessive mutations segregating in these lines, and additional experiments are underway to further explore this idea. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0428" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0428&rsqb;</number> Complementation Tests for mop3-1 and CC2343. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0429" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0429&rsqb;</number> Complementation tests are in progress between mop3-1 and CC2343 and all of the other mutants isolated to date (Examples 1, 3, 6). The data from the initial set of experiments is summarized in Table 11. All of these crosses were between homozygous mop3-1 B&prime; plants and heterozyotes for each of the other mutations. Thus, if mop3-1 is a mutation in the same gene as the mutation being tested, the expectation is 50% dark plants and 50% light plants when scoring for effects on B&prime;, and 50% ACS scores 1-4 and 50% ACS scores 5-7 when scoring for effects on PI&prime;. The mop3-1 mutation clearly defines a distinct gene from Mop1, rmr2, rmr8 and rmr9 as all the progeny are B&prime; with low ACS. Crosses of mop3-1 with rmr11-1 mutants showed dark plants; at least 1 dark plant was observed in &frac34; of the families, but the numbers were significantly lower than that expected for noncomplementation. We hypothesize that mop3-1 can interact with rmr11-1, as has been observed with other mutants (see Example 6). Crosses between rmr1-1 and mop3-1 produced a few dark anthered plants, but no increase in B&prime; pigment. The low number of these individuals is not consistent with noncomplementation.

<paragraph id="P-0430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0430&rsqb;</number> *Not all plants could be scored for anther color because in almost all families some of the tassels were destroyed prior to scoring. Therefore, more plants were scored for plant body phenotype than for ACS score. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> Families noted as Y in the anther color score 1 column were R-g (yellow) and therefore it was not possible to score anther color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> The complementation tests with the CC2343 mutation suggest that CC2343 is in a gene distinct from rmr2. The experiments with the other mutations are less clear as the segregation ratios do not fit either the complementation or noncomplementation hypotheses. The simplest explanation is that CC2343 may interact with Mop1-1, rmr1-1 and rmr11-1, but futher experiments will be necessary to test this hypothesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> Mu1 Methylation Tests with mop3-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> Sibling plants segregating mop3-1 were analyzed for the methylation status of Mu1 elements, as described in detail for mop1-1 in Example 2. DNA was extracted from light (heterozygous or homozygous wild type) and dark (homozygous for the mutation) plants, digested with HinfI and probed with Mu1. As in the case with mop1-1 (Example 2), Mu1 elements in the mutant plants were hypomethylated relative to Mu1 elements in their wild type siblings (equivalent data was obtained as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> for mop1-1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> The mop3-1 and CC2343 mutations share several features with Mop1-1. Similar to Mop1-1, the dark pigment phenotype of homozygous mop3-1 and CC2343 individuals is the result of increased b1 transcript levels (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</cross-reference>). Also similar to Mop1-1, mop3-1 and CC2343 occasionally show developmental effects when homozygous. Families generated from the self-fertilization of mop3-1 or CC2343 homozygotes were screened for the appearance of new phenotypes. Many of the plants showed severe developmental aberrations, including small or missing ears, runty tassels and often strongly feminized tassel structures (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27E,F</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> The plants were also very small. With mop3-1, these phenotypes occurred in essentially every plant that has been homozygous for multiple generations, but were less frequent in plants heterozygous for the mutation in the previous generation. Although fewer generations have been examined with mop3-1 and CC2343 relative to Mop1-1, the developmental defects in mop3-1 and CC2343 appear more frequently and are more severe. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> The complementation tests completed to date suggest that the mop3-1 and CC2343 mutations represent unique genes. Both mop3-1 and CC2343 are required to maintain the reduced expression state associated with B&prime; paramutation. Similar to mop1 mutations, mop3-1 and CC2343 do not heritably alter the reduced expression state as B&prime; segregates in subsequent generations in the absence of the mutation. Also similar to mop1-1, homozygous mop3-1 and CC2343 individuals show increased b1 transcript levels and developmental abnormalities. The mop3-1 mutation is also required to retain the extensive methylation associated with silenced Mutator elements. Experiments to examine the effects of CC2343 on Mu1 methylation are in progress. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> Overview. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> Genetic studies in the 1950&apos;s revealed several examples of gene regulation that are variable, unstable, but heritable. These phenomena included paramutation and the cycling of transposable element activity in maize. Numerous models were discussed, with a common theme that global chromosomal levels of control were operating (reviewed in Chandler and Vaucheret 2001). During the past twelve years extensive studies on transgene expression in plants has revealed a wide range of gene silencing phenomena (reviewed in Fagard and Vaucheret 2000). Transgene silencing can occur either at the transcriptional (TGS) or post-transcriptional level (PTGS). It can happen in cis, affecting single transgene copies or in trans, affecting unlinked sequences (including transgenes, endogenous genes or viruses) that share high sequence similarity. TGS is often associated with sequence homology and DNA methylation in the promoter regions. PTGS correlates with homology in the transcribed regions and DNA methylation in the transcribed region and the accumulation of small RNAs (21-25 nt). It is not yet clear whether these correlations are causes or consequences of gene silencing. Paramutation at b1 is more similar to TGS rather than PTGS, because the transcription rate of paramutated alleles is decreased (Patterson et al. 1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> Given that paramutation shares some features with transgene silencing (reviewed in Chandler et al. 2000), we tested whether mutants defective in paramutation might have effects on transgene silencing. Previous work done in the Chandler lab had generated several transgenic lines, all of which contained various B transgenes that had been produced to study anthocyanin gene regulation. The B gene encodes a transcription factor that activates the biosynthetic pathway. Expression of the B gene in a particular tissue will give rise to purple pigment in that tissue. All the transgenic lines were generated by particle bombardment of immature maize embryos (C. Carey, D. Selinger and V. Chandler, unpublished data; see Selinger et al. 1999 for detailed methods). Transgenic lines that contained two different B constructs were used. In both cases the transgene was silent in vegetative and reproductive plant tissues yet it remained active in the aleurone layer of the seed. Each independent transgene segregated as a single genetic locus, but DNA blot analyses revealed multiple copies of the construct had inserted into the genome. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> diagrams the constructs that were used to generate each of the transgenic lines. Transgenic line VLC44-27A carries a 35S promoter driving a B-I genomic construct. Expression of this transgene had never been phenotypically detectable in the plant. The BBBS transgene (VLC40-64A) carries the promoter from B-Bolivia fused to the B-I genomic region (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>; Selinger and Chandler, 2001). The original transgenic line was expressed in both the plant (leaf blade primarily) and in the aleurone layer of the seed. However, the plant pigmentation was lost in subsequent generations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> Four Mutants with Defects in Paramutation Relieve Transgene Silencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> For these experiments we combined each of four different mutations (Mop1-1, Mop2-1, rmr1-1 and rmr2-1) with lines containing the silent transgenes. The resulting F1 plants containing the transgene (hemizygous) were identified via PCR and DNA blots. All of these individuals were also heterozygous for a particular mutation. No activation of the transgenes was observed in this generation. These were backcrossed to plants homozygous for the particular mutation. This protocol yielded families that were segregating for the transgene and heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation being tested. For the experiments with Mop1-1, rmr-1 and Mop2-1, seeds carrying the transgene could be identified by the transgene&apos;s expression in the aleurone layer, which resulted in medium purple kernels. &lsqb;It is not known why both transgenic lines were completely silent in vegetative and floral tissues, but expression was observed in the differentiated aleurone layer.&rsqb; The medium purple kernels were planted and the plant and anther pigment phenotype was determined. If each of the mutations activated the transgene when homozygous, we expected ratios of 1:1 for active:inactive (presumably homozygous and heterozygous for the mutation, respectively). This expectation was met for both Mop1-1 and rmr1-1 with the two different transgenes (Table 12). Examples of the phenotype of each of the mutants and heterozygous siblings with the transgene, 35SB-/gen (VLC44-27A), are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A-D. Examples of activation of the BBBS transgene by rmr2-1 are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29E</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> Forty-four of these individuals had ACS scores between 1-4, consistent with a genotype of Rmr1/rmr1-1. Eight individuals had ACS scores of 6-7. This could be due to reversion of PI&prime; to PI-Rh, with these individuals being Rmr1/rmr1-1 and not activating the transgene. Alternatively, the plants with ACS6-7 could have been rmr1-1 homozygotes, but the transgene was not activated. Unfortunately testcrosses of these individuals were not obtained so the rmr1 genotype could not be assessed. However, the observed segregation ratios of plants with active and inactive transgenes (in the two families where this was observed) are most consistent with the first hypothesis. **P is &lt;0.05, significant deviation from 1:1 hypothesis; N.D.&equals;not determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> When active, neither of the transgenes used were ever expressed in the anthers. This enabled us to use anther color to follow the presence of heterozygous and homozygous mutants when the plants carried a-r allele and PI&prime;. This was the case for the rmr1-1 families and for approximately &frac14; of the Mop1-1 families. Crosses with Mop1-1 testers confirmed that plants that failed to activate the transgene were heterozygous for the mutation. For the experiments with rmr2-1 a dominant r1 allele was segregating, which also conferred purple aleurone pigment. Thus, planting purple kernels did not ensure that all plants would have inherited the transgene. As r1 segregated independently of the transgene and rmr2, &frac14; of the plants would be expected to receive the transgene and be homozygous for rmr2-1. The numbers of plants with an active transgene were consistent with this hypothesis (Table 12). Independent of whether we could use anther color scores to assess whether the mutation was heterozygous or homozygous, every plant was crossed with appropriate mutant testers to determine or confirm the mutant genotype. Not all crosses were successful, but in all confirmed cases with Mop1-1 and rmr1-1, when the mutation was homozygous, the transgene was activated as evidenced by increased pigment in homozygous mutant plants relative to heterozygous siblings. One possible exception is indicated by the significant deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio in the Mop2-1 experiment. We have considered two possible explanations for this deviation from the expected ratios. First, it is possible that homozygous Mop2-1 individuals are not always capable of activating the transgene. It is also possible that the penetrance of the Mop2-1 phenotype in these families was low. Testcrosses are in progress to determine the genotype of plants in each class. The Mop2-1 mutation was also crossed with an independent 35SB-Igenomic transgenic line (VLC44-20). This transgene was expressed in both the plant and seed for several generations, but silenced in the generation immediately prior to crossing with Mop2-1. When this transgene was present with heterozygous Mop2-1 it was not activated, but when the F1 was crossed with a homozygous Mop2-1 plant, {fraction (4/9)} of the progeny activated the transgene (same phenotype as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> Transgene Activation Involves Increases in the Transgene RNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> Based on the effect of the mutants on B&prime; and PI&prime; RNA levels, we hypothesized that the increased pigment levels seen in the transgenic lines containing the homozygous mutations was due to increased levels of RNA from the transgene. To investigate this we took samples from families carrying the VLC44-27A transgene and segregating individuals heterozygous or homozygous for several mutations. RNA was prepared using the same procedure as described in Example 1, and RNA blots prepared. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, each of the darkly pigmented plants (homozygous for either Mop1-1, rmr1-1 or rmr2-1) had dramatic increases in transgene-encoded b1 RNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> The Transgene is Activated at the Transcriptional Level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> To investigate whether the increased b1 RNA levels are caused by increases in transcription or increases in RNA stability we have begun to perform nuclear run-on assays (methods as described in Example 1). One set of experiments have been completed for Mop1-1 and rmr2-1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>). These initial results reveal that the VLC44-27A transgene (35SB-Igen) is transcribed at a low level in plants heterozygous for either Mop1-1 or rmr2-1 (light plants), and this is dramatically increased in plants homozygous for Mop1-1 or rmr2-1 (dark plants). This result was observed for both the b1 transcript and for the vector backbone (&plus;SK) used in the original construct. The latter result indicates that the vector backbone is being transcribed. The VCL44-27A transgene contains multiple rearranged copies (Y. Lin and V. Chandler, unpublished data), which is clearly enabling transcription of the vector sequences to occur, presumably due to juxtaposition near a promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> The Transgene can Remain Active when Mop1-1 and rmr2-1 are Segregated Away. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> We next tested whether the transgene could remain active in progeny plants that were again heterozygous for the mutations. For this experiment multiple individual plants that contained the active 35SB-Igen transgene and were homozygous for Mop1-1, rmr1-1 or rmr2-1 were outcrossed to b R-g P/stocks, which contained dominant functional alleles for all three genes (Mop1, rmr1 and rmr2). Purple seed, which contained the transgene were planted and the resulting plants scored for transgene pigmentation. With rmr1-1, all of the resulting plants were green, indicating that the transgene was efficiently resilenced in the presence of a functional Rmr1 allele. For Mop1-1 and rmr2-1, the transgene was resilenced in most of the progeny, but there were exceptions, indicating that in rare individuals the transgene could remain active, even in the presence of functional Mop1 or Rmr2 alleles. The number of plants that produced progeny with an active transgene and the total number tested are summarized for each mutation in Table 13.

<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> We then tested whether the transgene that remained active in Mop1/Mop1-1 or Rmr2/rmr2-1 plants would remain active into the next generation by crossing these again to b R-g P/testers. One-half of the progeny would be expected to be heterozygous for Mop1-1 or rmr2-1 and the other half homozygous wild type. Seeds containing the transgene were identified by their seed pigmentation, planted and scored for transgene expression in the plant. A total of 6 and 12 plants from the Mop1 and rmr2 experiments were tested, respectively (Table 14). Six of the six Mop1/Mop1-1 heterozygotes and 11/12 of the Rmr2/rmr2-1 heterozygotes transmitted active transgenes to most if not all of their progeny (Table 14). Interestingly, in this last generation there was a much larger number of progeny plants that carried an active transgene, as compared to the first generation of crosses (compare Table 13 and Table 14), indicating that the transgene was heritably activated and it remains active in subsequent generations in the absence of the mutations that induced the original activation. Thus, it may be possible to use these mutations to activate other silent transgenes and then segregate the mutations from the active transgene. Additional crosses are in progress to determine the stability of the active transgenes in the absence of the mutations.

<paragraph id="P-0455" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0455&rsqb;</number> Our results demonstrate that four different genes that are required for paramutation (Mop1, mop2, rmr1 and rmr2) are also required to maintain the silent state of several transgene loci. Our initial results with mutations in two genes (Mop1-1 and rmr2-1) suggest that the activation is occurring at the transcriptional level. Our experiments further demonstrate that the Mop1-1 and rmr2-1 mutations can heritably activate the transgene, such that it remains active even when the mutations are segregated away. Additional experiments need to be done to determine the stability of the transcriptional activation and to determine if the other two mutations, Mop2-1 and rmr1-1 also activate the transgene at the transcriptional level. While all of the transgenes tested contain part of the b1 gene, none of the transgenes contain the sequences required for b1 paramutation (M. Stam and V. Chandler, unpublished data). Thus, we hypothesize that the activation of the b1 transgenes by these mutations will be a general effect that will occur with other transgenes as well. This is currently being tested using several transgenes that contain no b1 sequences. Additional experiments will also be required to determine if these mutations can activate transgenes that are post-transcriptionally silenced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0458" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0458&rsqb;</number> Additional maize mutations that reduce the maintenance of the PI&prime; paramutant state were identified from seedling screens similar to those described in Example 3 and mature plant screens using EMS-derived materials described in Example 3. Genetic complementation tests suggest that these mutations define five novel rmr loci (rmr6, rmr7, rmr8, rmr9, rmr11) and two new alleles of Mop1. RMR6 is required for transcriptional repression of PI&prime;. RMR6, RMR9 and RMR11 functions are required to heritably maintain the PI&prime; paramutant state. Phenotypic analysis indicates that RMR6, RMR8, and RMR11 functions are important for proper plant growth and development. Mutant corn plants that are homozygous for mutations in either the rmr7 and rmr9 genes have a normal developmental phenotype. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0463" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0463&rsqb;</number> Seedling screening similar to that described in Example 3 was used to identify an M2 family (96406) that segregated darkly pigmented seedlings. The genetic factor responsible for this darkly pigmented seedling phenotype is inherited as a single locus recessive factor that is not closely linked to the pI1 locus (see below). Genetic complementation test results (see below) demonstrate that this recessive factor defines a novel locus designated required to maintain repression 6 (rmr6) whose function is needed to maintain transcriptional repression of PI&prime; and sexual transmission of the PI&prime; paramutant state at a 100% frequency. The recessive rmr6 mutation identified by the seedling screen is designated rmr6-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> rmr6-1 is Inherited as a Single Locus Recessive Mutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0465" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0465&rsqb;</number> Homozygous rmr6-11rmr6-1 plants having a PI-Rh-like phenotype were outcrossed to PlI/PI&apos;testers. All F1 progeny plants (32 individuals from 5 independent outcrosses) had a PI&prime; anther phenotype (7 ACS 1; 17 ACS 2; 8 ACS 3) indicating that the rmr6-1 allele is recessive and further that PI&prime; alleles transmitted from homozygous rmr6-1/rmr6-1 plants are not recalcitrant to subsequent paramutation. The PI-Rh-like phenotype was recovered in 21/123 (17%) F2 plants derived from three independent self-pollinations of F1 plants (44 ACS 1; 46 ACS 2; 12 ACS 3; 21 ACS 7). The observed frequency of mutant phenotypes (17%) is not significantly different from the 25% expected from the segregation of a single locus recessive mutation (&square;2&equals;0.32; P&gt;0.05). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0466" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0466&rsqb;</number> rmr6-1 Defines a Trans-Acting Function Acting Upon PI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0467" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0467&rsqb;</number> The mutant phenotype (PI-Rh-like anthers) did not cosegregate with alleles of salmon silks1 (sm1), a genetic locus 10 cM distal to the pI1 locus. The PI-Rh allele subjected to EMS mutagenesis is genetically linked to the recessive sm1 allele sm1-EMS, therefore any mutations that occur close to the pI1 locus should also be genetically linked to sm1-EMS. One of the F2 families described above had individuals that were either wild type or mutant with regards to the salmon silks trait. Two of 43 (5%) of the wild type plants (Sm1/Sm1 or Sm1/sm1-EMS) had a PI-Rh-like phenotype and 3 of 11 (27%) of the mutant (sm1-EMS/sm1-EMS) plants had a PI-Rh-like phenotype. The absence of strong cosegregation between the PI-Rh-like phenotypes and mutant sm1 phenotypes indicates that rmr6-1 is not tightly linked to sm1 and therefore not tightly linked to pI1. This result strongly suggests that the rmr6 locus is distinct from pI1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> rmr6-1 defines a novel rmr locus. Complementation crosses were made between homozygous mutant plants (PI-Rh anthers) and plants heterozygous for each different mutation (PI&prime; anthers). All tests completed to date are summarized in Table 15. The rmr6-1 mutation clearly complemented all the mutations, except rmr11-1. If rmr6-1 and rmr11-1 were alleles of the same gene, we would expect that &frac12; of the complementation test progeny (&tilde;26 individuals) would have PI-Rh-like anthers. Our observed frequency of PI-Rh-like phenotypes (15/52) is significantly different from this expectation (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;5; P &lt;0.05). Given that the rmr11-1 mutation also shows non-complementation with the rmr1-1 mutation, the most likely interpretation of these results is that rmr6-1 defines a locus distinct from rmr11. However, the observed partial non-complementation suggests that RMR6 and RMR11 functions may cooperate to achieve efficient repression of PI&prime;.

<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> Complementation tests identify four unique loci. For each allele listed in bold, the underlying series of alleles were tested for complementation. The number of ears sampled for each test are indicated along with the total numbers of mature plants with a given Anther Color Score derived from the seeds off those ears. Complementation should result in all plants with an ACS between 1-5. This result is consistent with the mutations being in different genes. Failure to complement would produce 50% darkly pigmented individuals (ACS 6-7). The simplest interpretation of this result is that the two mutations are in the same gene. However, it is also possible that when two genes are acting on the same pathway, double heterozygotes can show failure to complement. This is well documented and referred to as extragenic noncomplementation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> Crosses were made to four different homozygous PI-Rh tester stocks to determine if all the pI1 alleles sexually transmitted from PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr6-1/rmr6-1 plants remained paramutagenic. Normally, crosses between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime; plants give rise exclusively to progeny with a PI&prime;/PI&prime; phenotype and genotype (Hollick et al. 1995). Twenty-five out of 36 crosses made between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr6-1/rmr6-1 plants gave rise to plants with P1-Rh-like anthers. In total, 167/688 (24%) of the testcross progeny had ACS7 anthers (73 ACS 1; 232 ACS 2; 117 ACS 3; 50 ACS 4; 32 ACS 5; 17 ACS 6; 167 ACS 7). Thus PI&prime; alleles can change back to a meiotically-heritable, non-paramutagenic, PI-Rh state in plants homozygous for rmr6-1. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> The PI-Rh-like phenotype seen in homozygous rmr6-1 plants cosegregates with uniform alterations of normal plant development. First, homozygous rmr6-1 plants flower 5-7 days later, on average, than their heterozygous siblings. Second, homozygous rmr6-1 plants are 25% shorter, on average, than their heterozygous siblings. Third, homozygous rmr6-1 plants resemble tiller shoots in that there is frequent feminization of the apical inflorescence (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>), retardation of internode elongation for the apical leaves, and poor ear shoot development including the occurrence of disorganized rows of grains on the mature ears. Pollen grains from homozygous rmr6-1 plants appear visibly normal although no fertility tests have been conducted. These morphological phenotypes have been seen in all rmr6-1 families tested to date including introgression material using the maize elite inbred A632. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> RNase protection experiments like those described in Examples 1 and 3 indicate that pI1 RNA levels are 26-fold higher in anther tissues of homozygous rmr6-1 plants relative to their heterozygous siblings (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</cross-reference>). Five independent in vitro transcription assays (see Example 1 for methods) using isolated husk nuclei demonstrate that pI1 transcription is 4-fold higher in homozygous rmr6-1 plants relative to their heterozygous siblings (FIGS. <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B-C). Thus RMR6 function is required to maintain transcriptional repression of the PI&prime; allele. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0477" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0477&rsqb;</number> Genomic DNA samples from a family of individuals segregating 1:1 for rmr6-1/rmr6-1 and rmr6-1/&plus; types was analyzed for the cytosine methylation status of Mu1 sequences as described in Example 2 above. All five of the rmr6-1/&plus; plants had hypermethylated Mu1 terminal inverted repeats, whereas six of the seven rmr6-1/rmr6-1 plants had hypomethylated Mu1 terminal inverted repeats (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</cross-reference>). Thus RMR6 function appears to be involved in maintaining the hypermethylated state of Mu1 terminal inverted repeat sequences. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0480" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0480&rsqb;</number> Seedling screens similar to that described in Example 3 were used to identify two M2 families (9650 and 98939) that segregated darkly pigmented seedlings. The genetic factors responsible for these darkly pigmented seedling phenotypes are inherited as single locus recessive factors that are not genetically linked to the pI1 locus (see below). Genetic complementation test results (Table 15) demonstrate that these two recessive factors define a novel locus designated required to maintain repression 7 (rmr7). The recessive rmr7 mutations identified by the seedling screens are designated rmr7-1 (formerly 9650) and rmr7-2 (formerly 98939). </paragraph>

All the F1 progeny plants (22 individuals from 2 independent outcrosses) had a PI&prime; anther phenotype indicating that the rmr7-1 allele is recessive and further that PI&prime; alleles transmitted from homozygous rmr7-1/rmr7-1 plants are still capable of causing paramutation. The PI-Rh-like phenotype was recovered in 34/154 (22%) F2 plants derived from seven independent self-pollinations of F1 plants (120 ACS 1-ACS 4; 34 ACS 7). The observed frequency of mutant phenotypes (22%) is not significantly different from the 25% expected from a single locus recessive mutation (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.53; P &gt;0.05). </paragraph>

All F1 progeny plants (23 individuals from 2 independent outcrosses) had a clear PI&prime; anther phenotype indicating that the rmr7-2 allele is recessive and further that PI&prime; alleles transmitted from homozygous rmr7-2/rmr7-2 plants are not recalcitrant to subsequent paramutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0485" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0485&rsqb;</number> rmr7-1 Defines a Trans-Acting Function Acting Upon PI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0486" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0486&rsqb;</number> The PI-Rh-like anther phenotype conferred in rmr7-1/rmr7-1 plants did not co-segregate with the pI1 locus in a F2 mapping population. The F2 mapping population was derived by first crossing a PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr7-1/rmr7-1 plant to the elite inbred A632 (pI-A632/pI-A632; Rmr7-A632/Rmr7-A632) and then self-pollinating one of the resultant F1 plants. Fifty-six of 189 (30%) F2 plants were PI/P/based on linked simple satellite repeat (SSR) polymorphisms yet only ten of these 56 PI/P/plants (18%) had a PI-Rh-like anther phenotype (10 ACS 7). If the rmr7-1 mutation was tightly linked to the PI&prime; allele then the expectation was that greater than 50% of the PI/P/F2 plants would also have a dark-anther phenotype. The absence of co-segregation between the PI/P/genotype and the PI-Rh-like phenotype indicates that the rmr7 locus is unlinked to the pI1 locus. All 46 pI-A632/pI-A632 plants had visibly similar levels of anther pigment suggesting that RMR7 function specifically affects expression of the PI&prime; allele and is not a general modifier of other pI1 alleles or of anthocyanin production in general. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0487" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0487&rsqb;</number> rmr7-1 and rmr7-2 Define a Novel rmr Locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0488" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0488&rsqb;</number> Complementation crosses were made between homozygous mutant (PI-Rh anthers) plants and plants heterozygous for a different mutation (PI&prime; anthers). Results of these complementation crosses are shown in Table 15. The rmr7-1 and rmr7-2 mutations fail to complement each other indicating that these two mutations define alleles of the same gene. Other test results demonstrate that the rmr7-1 mutation complements mutations at rmr1, rmr2, Mop1, rmr6, rmr8, and rmr9. Thus the rmr7-1 and rmr7-2 mutations identify a novel rmr locus, required to maintain repression 7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0489" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0489&rsqb;</number> PI&prime; Does not Change Back to a Meiotically-Heritable PI-Rh State in Homozygous rmr7-1 or rmr7-2 Plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0490" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0490&rsqb;</number> In wild type backgrounds, crosses between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime; plants give rise exclusively to progeny with a PI&prime;/PI&prime; phenotype and genotype (Hollick et al. 1995). However, PI&prime; can change back to PI-Rh at particular frequencies when carried with several of the other homozygous mutants (Mop1-1, Dorweiler et al, 2000; rmr1-1, rmr1-2, rmr2-1, Hollick and Chandler 2001; and rmr6-1, rmr9-1, rmr11-1, this document). To determine if all the pI1 alleles sexually transmitted from PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr7-1/rmr7-1 plants remained paramutagenic, crosses were made to seven different homozygous P1-Rh tester stocks. None of the 12 crosses made between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr7-1/rmr7-1 plants gave rise to progeny plants with PI-Rh-like anthers. The distribution of anther color scores among the progeny was (119/235 ACS 1; 100/235 ACS 2; 12/235 ACS 3; 41235 ACS 4). Similarly, crosses were made to four different homozygous PI-Rh tester stocks to determine if all the pI1 alleles sexually transmitted from PI&prime;/PI&prime;, rmr7-2/rmr7-2 plants remained paramutagenic. None of the 4 crosses made between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr7-2/rmr7-2 plants gave rise to progeny plants with PI-Rh-like anthers. The distribution of anther color scores among the progeny was (25/69 ACS 1; 39/69 ACS 2; 5/69 ACS 4). These anther color scores are very similar to that seen in the progenies of crosses between PI&prime;/PI&prime; (wild type for all paramutation defect loci) and PI-Rh/PI-Rh plants (Hollick et al. 1995). Thus, there is no evidence that lack of RMR7 function allows PI&prime; to change back to a meiotically-heritable PI-Rh state. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0492" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0492&rsqb;</number> The PI-Rh-like phenotype seen in homozygous rmr7-1 and homozygous rmr7-2 plants is not associated with any obvious developmental abnormalities. Field observations of F2 families segregating either the rmr7-1 or rmr7-2 mutations as well as comparison of rmr7-1/rmr7-1 and rmr7-1/&plus; individuals derived from intercrossing rmr7-1/rmr7-1 and rmr7-1/&plus; F2 siblings show relative uniformity of plant morphology. There are currently no observations to indicate that RMR7 functions are required for normal growth and development. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0494" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0494&rsqb;</number> Description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0495" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0495&rsqb;</number> This locus was identified from screening mature plant phenotypes of M2 families derived from the original chemical mutagenesis described in Example 3. Mature plants with full-colored anthers were found segregating in this particular M2 family (9583). This mutation does not affect the seedling pigment phenotype of PI&prime; plants; its effects are only manifest in the main body of the plant and in the anthers. Homozygous rmr8-1/rmr8-1, PI&prime;/PI&prime; seedlings have weak coloration indistinguishable from that of PI&prime;/PI&prime; seedlings but the anthers of rmr8-1/rmr8-1, PI&prime;/PI&prime; plants are indistinguishable from those of PI-Rh/PI-Rh plants. The genetic factor responsible for this darkly pigmented anther phenotype is inherited as a single locus recessive factor that is genetically unlinked to the pI1 locus (see below). Genetic complementation test results (Table 15) demonstrate that this recessive factor defines a novel locus designated required to maintain repression 8 (rmr8). The recessive rmr8 mutation identified by the mature plant screen is designated rmr8-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0496" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0496&rsqb;</number> rmr8-1 is Inherited as a Single Locus Recessive Mutation. Homozygous rmr8-1/rmr8-1 plants having a PI-Rh-like phenotype were outcrossed to PI&prime;/PI&prime; testers. All F1 progeny plants (29 individuals from 2 independent outcrosses) had a clear PI&prime; anther phenotype indicating that the rmr8-1 allele is recessive and further that PI&prime; alleles transmitted from homozygous rmr8-1/rmr8-1 plants are still capable of paramutation. The dark-anther phenotype (ACS 5, 6, and 7 classes) was recovered in 7154(13%) F2 plants derived from three independent self-pollinations of F1 plants (3 ACS 1; 18 ACS 2; 21 ACS 3; 5 ACS 4; 2 ACS 5; 2 ACS 6; 3 ACS 7). The observed frequency of non-PI&prime; phenotypes (13%) is significantly different from the 25% expected from a single locus recessive mutation (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;3.13; P &lt;0.05) and is also significantly different from the 6.25% expected if the dark-anther trait is due to the presence of two unlinked recessive mutations (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;3.89; P &lt;0.05). It is possible that the low frequency of dark-anthered plants in these F2 families was due to lethal effects of an EMS-induced mutation found closely linked to rmr8. In support of this hypothesis, segregation ratios more closely approximated 25% in subsequent F2 families derived from advanced generations of rmr8-1/rmr8-1 material. Four of 17 (24%) and 33/119 (28%) F2 plants from two independent families had dark-anther phenotypes (combination of ACS 5, 6 and 7) consistent with the hypothesis that the dark-anther phenotype is due to a single locus recessive mutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0497" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0497&rsqb;</number> rmr8-1 Defines a Trans-Acting Function Affecting Anther Pigmentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0498" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0498&rsqb;</number> The dark-anther phenotype conferred in rmr8-1/rmr8-1 plants did not co-segregate with the pI1 locus in a F2 mapping population. The F2 mapping population was derived by first crossing a PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr8-1/rmr8-1 plant to the elite inbred A632 (pI-A632/pI-A632; Rmr8-A632/Rmr8-A632) and then self-pollinating one of the resultant F1 plants. Forty-one of 169 (24%) F2 plants were PI/P/based on linked simple satellite repeat (SSR) polymorphisms yet only six of these 41 PI/P/plants (15%) had a dark-anther phenotype (1 ACS 5; 1 ACS 6; 4 ACS 7). If the rmr8-1 mutation was linked to the PI&prime; allele then the expectation was that greater than 50% of the PI/P/F2 plants would also have a dark-anther phenotype. The absence of co-segregation between the PI/P/genotype and the dark-anther phenotype indicates that the rmr8 locus is unlinked to the pI1 locus. Eleven of 46 pI-A632/pI-A632 plants (24%) had visibly more anther pigment than the remaining pI-A632/pI-A632 siblings. This is the frequency of individuals expected to carried be homozygous for rmr8-1 allele, suggesting that RMR8 function might increase pigment on other pI1 alleles in addition to the PI&prime; allele (see below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0499" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0499&rsqb;</number> rmr8-1 Defines a Novel rmr Locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0500" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0500&rsqb;</number> Complementation crosses were made between homozygous mutant (PI-Rh anthers) plants and plants heterozygous for a different mutation (PI&prime; anthers). Results shown in Table 15 indicate that the rmr8-1 mutation complements the rmr1-1, rmr2-1, rmr6-1, rmr7-1, and Mop1-5 mutations, suggesting it is at a distinct locus. However, rmr8-1 showed partial complementation with the rmr9-1, Mop1-2EMS, and Mop1-4 mutations. if the rmr8-1 mutation is an allele of Mop1 the expectation is that all alleles of Mop1 should behave similarly. This was not observed. No dark anthered individuals were observed in progeny from the Mop1-5 experiments, and much fewer than the predicted 50% were observed in progeny from the Mop1-4 experiment (Table 15). Only 1/22 progeny from this cross had a PI-Rh-like anther phenotype (2 ACS 1; 7 ACS 2; 5 ACS 3; 5 ACS 4; 1 ACS 5; 1 ACS 6; 1 ACS 7) and only 3/22 progeny had a dark-anther phenotype (ACS 5, 6 or 7). Finally, the observed frequency of PI-Rh-like types (ACS 7) in the Mop1-2EMS progeny is significantly different from the frequency expected for this hypothesis (&square;2&equals;12.25; P &lt;0.01), but the observed frequency of dark-anther phenotypes (ACS 5, 6 or 7) is not significantly different from 50% (&square;2&equals;2.25). The most likely interpretation of these results is that rmr8-1 and several Mop1 alleles show partial non-complementation and rmr8-1 defines a locus distinct from Mop1. The observed partial non-complementation suggests that RMR8 and Mop1 functions may cooperate to achieve efficient repression of PI&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0501" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0501&rsqb;</number> If the rmr8-1 mutation is an allele of rmr9, then &frac12; of all progeny (35 individuals) from these two crosses should have a PI-Rh-like anther phenotype. The observed frequency of PI-Rh-like types is significantly different from the expected frequency for this hypothesis (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;24; P &lt;0.01). However, the observed frequency of dark-anther phenotypes (ACS 5, 6 or 7) is not significantly different from 50% (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.71; P &gt;0.05). Given that the rmr9-1 mutation shows full complementation with the Mop1-2EMS and Mop1-4 mutations (Table 15), while the rmr8-1 mutation partially complements these mutations, the most likely interpretation of these results is that rmr8-1 defines a locus distinct from rmr9. The observed partial non-complementation between rmr8-1 and rmr9-1 suggests that RMR8 and RMR9 functions may cooperate to achieve efficient repression of PI&prime;. It is interesting that rmr8-1 interacts with both rmr9-1 and several Mop1 mutations, but there is no observed interaction in the complementation tests between rmr9-1 and the Mop1 mutations. </paragraph>

None of the 4 crosses made between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr8-1/rmr8-1 plants gave rise to progeny plants with PI-Rh-like anthers. The distribution of anther color scores among the progeny (9/86 ACS 1; 51/86 ACS 2; 13/86 ACS 3; 3/86 ACS 4) is very similar to that seen in the progenies of crosses between PI&prime;/PI&prime; in wild type stocks and PI-Rh/PI-Rh plants (Hollick et al. 1995).

<paragraph id="P-0504" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0504&rsqb;</number> The rmr8-1 Mutation Affects Plant Development. The PI-Rh-like phenotype seen in homozygous rmr8-1 plants co-segregates with uniform developmental abnormalities. Homozygous rmr8-1 plants have a smaller tassel with reduced numbers of tassel branches, failure of anther extrusion from the glumes, and a limited development of female reproductive structures in the tassel. The severity of this suite of traits is fairly consistent and all the plants with darkly pigmented anthers clearly have the same suite of developmental abnormalities. The severity of these abnormal phenotypes remains constant in advanced generations (3 generations of self-pollination) of a homozygous rmr8-1 background. </paragraph>

Mature plants with full-colored anthers were found segregating in this particular M2 family (95270). This mutation does not affect the seedling pigment phenotype of PI&prime; plants; its effects are only manifest in the main body of the plant and in the anthers. Homozygous rmr9-1/rmr9-1, PI&prime;/PI&prime; seedlings have weak coloration indistinguishable from that of PI&prime;/PI&prime; seedlings, while the anthers of rmr9-1/rmr9-1, PI&prime;/PI&prime; plants are indistinguishable from those of PI-Rh/PI-Rh plants. The genetic factor responsible for this darkly pigmented anther phenotype is inherited as a single locus recessive factor that is genetically unlinked to the pI1 locus (see below). Genetic complementation test results (Table 15) suggest that this recessive factor defines a novel locus designated required to maintain repression 9 (rmr9) whose function is required to maintain sexual transmission of the PI&prime; paramutant state at 100% frequency. The recessive rmr9 mutation identified by the mature plant screen is designated rmr9-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0510" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0510&rsqb;</number> rmr9-1 is Inherited as a Single Locus Recessive Mutation. Homozygous rmr9-1/rmr9-1 plants having a P1-Rh-like phenotype were outcrossed to PI&prime;/PI&prime; testers. All F1 progeny plants (23 individuals from a single outcross) had a PI&prime; anther phenotype indicating that the rmr9-1 allele is recessive and further that PI&prime; alleles transmitted from homozygous rmr9-1/rmr9-1 plants are not recalcitrant to subsequent paramutation. The PI-Rh-like anther phenotype (ACS 7) was recovered in only 2/29 (7%) F2 plants derived from three independent self-pollinations of F1 plants (3 ACS 1; 12 ACS 2; 6 ACS 3; 6 ACS 4; 2 ACS 7). The observed frequency of PI-Rh-like phenotypes (7%) is significantly different from the 25% expected from a single locus recessive mutation (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;3.8; P &lt;0.05), but is not significantly different from the 6.25% expected if the dark-anther trait is due to the presence of two unlinked recessive mutations (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.02; P &gt;0.05). It is also possible that the low frequency of dark-anther plants in these F2 families was due to lethal effects of an EMS-induced mutation found closely linked to rmr9. In support of this latter hypothesis, segregation ratios more closely approximated 25% in subsequent F2 families derived from advanced generation rmr9-1/rmr9-1 material. Three of 16 (19%) and 5/22 (23%) F2 plants from two independent families had PI-Rh-like anther phenotypes. These latter segregation ratios are more consistent with the single locus recessive hypothesis (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.25 and &khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.045, respectively) rather than a model in which the dark-anther trait is due to the presence of two unlinked recessive mutations (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;4; P &lt;0.05 and &khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;9.6; P &lt;0.01, respectively). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0512" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0512&rsqb;</number> The dark-anther phenotype conferred in rmr9-1/rmr9-1 plants did not co-segregate with specific pI1 alleles in a F2 segregating family. To generate this particular F2 family, a PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr9-1/rmr9-1 individual was first crossed to a PI&prime;/PI&prime; tester stock in which the PI&prime; alleles are linked (&lt;1cM) to a translocation breakpoint between the long arm of chromosome 6 and the short arm of chromosome 9. This translocation breakpoint is also tightly linked to a recessive kernel mutation at the waxy1 locus (wx1) found on chromosome 9. Thus the PI&prime; alleles in these PI&prime;/PI&prime; testers are approximately 5cM from mutant wx1 alleles. Resulting F1 progeny had a clear PI&prime; phenotype and also displayed 25% pollen abortion, which is expected in a translocation heterozygote. Upon self-pollination, the ears of these F1 plants segregated &frac14; waxy kernels as expected. Mutant wx1/wx1 kernels were selected and sowed. Three of the 16 plants grown from the wx1/wx1 kernels had a PI-Rh (ACS 7) phenotype. If the rmr9-1 mutation resides at the pI1 locus, then none of the wx1/wx1 kernels should have also been homozygous for the rmr9-1 mutation. Thus, preliminary data suggest that the rmr9 locus is distinct from pI1. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0514" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0514&rsqb;</number> Complementation crosses were made between homozygous mutant (PI-Rh anthers) plants and plants heterozygous for a different mutation (PI&prime; anthers). Results (Table 15) indicate that the rmr9-1 mutation complements mutations at rmr1, rmr2, Mop1, rmr6, rmr7 and rmr11. Thus the rmr9-1 mutation identifies a new rmr locus, rmr9. The interactions with rmr8-1 are discussed above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0516" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0516&rsqb;</number> Crosses were made to five different homozygous PI-Rh tester stocks to determine if all the pI1 alleles sexually transmitted from PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr9-1/rmr9-1 plants remained paramutagenic as observed in wild type stocks (Hollick et al. 1995). One of the 5 crosses made between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime;; rmr9-1/rmr9-1 plants gave rise to one progeny plant with PI-Rh-like anthers. In addition, the distribution of Anther Color Scores among all the progeny of these 5 crosses (6/100 ACS 1; 42/100 ACS 2; 231100 ACS 3; 18/100 ACS 4; 10/100 ACS 5; 1/100 ACS 7) is skewed towards higher Anther Color Scores than seen in the progenies of crosses between PI&prime;/PI&prime; and PI-Rh/PI-Rh plants wild type for RMR9 (Hollick et al. 1995). Thus, preliminary data suggest that PI&prime; alleles can sometimes change back to a meiotically-heritable, non-paramutagenic or weakly-paramutagenic state in plants homozygous for rmr9-1. </paragraph>

There are currently no observations to indicate that RMR9 functions are required for normal growth and development. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0521" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0521&rsqb;</number> Seedling screens similar to that described in Example 3 was used to identify an M2 family (98287) that segregated darkly pigmented seedlings. The genetic factor responsible for this darkly pigmented seedling phenotype is inherited as a single locus recessive factor that is not genetically linked to the p1 locus (see below). Genetic complementation test results (see below) suggest that this recessive factor defines a novel locus designated required to maintain repression 11 (rmr11), although this mutation appears to interact with mutations at several other loci. Further genetic tests indicate that RMR11 function is required to maintain the PI&prime; paramutant state at 100% frequency through sexual transmission. The recessive rmr11 mutation identified by the seedling screen is designated rmr11-1. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0523" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0523&rsqb;</number> Homozygous rmr11-1/rmr11-1 plants having a P1-Rh-like phenotype were outcrossed to PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers. Almost &frac12; of all the F1 progeny plants (8 of 25 individuals from two independent outcrosses) had a PI-Rh anther phenotype (2 ACS 1; 12 ACS 2; 2 ACS 4; 1 ACS 5; 8 ACS 7) suggesting that the rmr11-1 allele might represent a dominant mutation. However, the PI-Rh-like phenotype was recovered in 12/40 (30%) F2 plants derived from two independent self-pollinations of ACS 3 F1 plants (3 ACS 1; 19 ACS 2; 5 ACS 3; 1 ACS 4; 12 ACS 7). The observed frequency of F2 mutant phenotypes (30%) is not significantly different from the 25% expected from a single locus recessive mutation (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.4) and is consistent with the hypothesis that the dark-anther phenotype, is due to a single locus recessive mutation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0525" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0525&rsqb;</number> The mutant phenotype (PI-Rh-like anthers) did not co-segregate with alleles of salmon silks1 (sm1), a genetic locus 10 cM distal to the pI1 locus. The PI-Rh allele that was subjected to EMS mutagenesis is genetically linked to the recessive sm1 allele, sm1-EMS. Therefore any mutations that occur close to the pI1 locus should also be genetically linked to sm1-EMS. One of the F2 families mentioned above was segregating the salmon silks trait. Three of 17 F2 progeny had the recessive sm1-EMS/sm1-EMS phenotype yet none of these three plants had dark-colored anthers. Thus, the rmr11-1 mutation appears to be genetically unlinked to the sm1 locus indicating that rmr11-1 defines a genetic locus distinct from pI1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0526" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0526&rsqb;</number> rmr11-1 Defines a Novel rmr Locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0527" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0527&rsqb;</number> Complementation crosses were made between homozygous mutant (PI-Rh anthers) plants and plants heterozygous for a different mutation (PI&prime; anthers). Results (Table 15) indicate that the rmr11-1 mutation complements mutations at rmr2, rmr9 and Mop1. However, the rmr11-1 mutation shows only partial complementation with the rmr6-1 mutation and absence of complementation with the rmr1-1 mutation. If the rmr11-1 mutation was an allele of rmr1, then &frac12; of all progeny (37 individuals) from the three complementation crosses should have a PI-Rh-like anther phenotype. The observed frequency of PI-Rh-like types (37183) is not significantly different from the expected frequency for this hypothesis (36.5/83), suggesting that the rmr 1-1 and rmr1-1 mutations define the same locus. However, the rmr11-1 mutation also shows partial non-complementation with the rmr6-1 mutation, which is clearly a distinct locus from that defined by rmr1-1. Fifteen of the 53 progeny from the rmr6-1 complementation crosses had a PI-Rh-like anther phenotype (1 ACS 1; 13 ACS 2; 17 ACS 3; 6 ACS 4; 1 ACS 5; 15 ACS 7) demonstrating some non-complementation between the rmr6-1 and rmr11-1 mutations. If rmr6-1 and rmr11-1 were alleles of the same gene, we would expect that &frac12; of the progeny (26-27 individuals) would have PI-Rh-like anthers. Our observed frequency of PI-Rh-like phenotypes is significantly different from this expectation (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;5; P &lt;0.05) indicating only partial genetic non-complementation. Given that the rmr11-1 mutation fails to complement mutations previously shown to be non-allelic, the most likely interpretation of these results is that rmr11-1 defines a locus distinct from either rmr1 or rmr6. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0529" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0529&rsqb;</number> Crosses were made to five different homozygous PI-Rh tester stocks to determine if all the p1l alleles sexually transmitted from PI&prime;/PI&prime;, rmr11-1/rmr11-1 plants remained paramutagenic as observed in wild type stocks (Hollick et al. 1995). Nine of the 15 crosses made between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime; rmr11-1/rmr11-1 plants gave rise to at least one progeny plant with PI-Rh-like anthers (43/252 ACS 1; 105/252 ACS 2; 20/252 ACS 3; 211252 ACS 4; 81252 ACS 5; 3/252 ACS 6; 52/252 ACS 7). Thus, PI&prime; alleles can sometimes change back to a meiotically-heritable, non-paramutagenic or weakly-paramutagenic state in plants homozygous for rmr11-1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0530" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0530&rsqb;</number> The rmr11-1 mutation affects plant development. The PI-Rh-like phenotype seen in homozygous rmr11-1 plants co-segregates with alterations of normal plant development.

The genetic factors responsible for these darkly pigmented seedling phenotypes are inherited as single locus recessive factors (see below). Genetic complementation test results (Table 15) suggest that these two recessive factors define additional alleles of Mop1. Further genetic tests indicate that these mutations can reduce the ability to maintain the PI&prime; paramutant state at a 100% frequency through sexual transmission. The recessive mutations identified by these seedling screens are currently designated Mop1-4 and Mop1-5. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0535" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0535&rsqb;</number> Homozygous Mop1-4/Mop1-4 plants having a PI-Rh-like phenotype were outcrossed to PI&prime;/PI&prime; testers. All F1 progeny plants (39 individuals from 3 independent outcrosses) had a PI&prime; anther phenotype (5 ACS 1; 22 ACS 2; 12 ACS 3) indicating that the Mop1-4 allele is recessive and further that PI&prime; alleles transmitted from homozygous Mop1-4/Mop1-4 plants are capable of paramutation. The PI-Rh-like anther phenotype (ACS 7) was recovered in 10/64 F2 plants derived from three independent self-pollinations of F1 plants (30 ACS 1; 15 ACS 2; 2 ACS 3; 10 ACS 7). The observed frequency of PI-Rh-like phenotypes (16%) is not significantly different from the 25% expected from a single locus recessive mutation (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;1.95; P &gt;0.05) but is significantly different from the 6.25% expected if the dark-anther trait is due to the presence of two unlinked recessive mutations (&khgr;<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;9.7; P &lt;0.01). All F2 progeny with ACS 7 anthers were 213 the height of their PI&prime;-like siblings. Five of the 62 F2 progeny produced barren (no flowers) tassels so it was not possible to assign these to a given Anther Color Score class. However, these five anther-less progeny were short in stature and had very strong plant color similar to all other F2 plants that had ACS 7 anthers. If we include these five anther-less progeny among the &ldquo;ACS 7&rdquo; mutant class, then 15/62 (24%) of the F2 progeny have the mutant phenotype. These F2 segregation ratios are consistent with the hypothesis that the dark-anther phenotype, and the dark-plant phenotype, is due to a single locus recessive mutation. </paragraph>

Results (Table 15) indicate that the Mop1-4 and Mop1-5 mutations complement mutations at rmr1, rmr2, rmr6, rmr9 and rmr11. However, the two mutations fail to complement each other and the Mop1-1 mutation. If the Mop1-4 mutation is an allele of Mop1, then &frac12; of all progeny (15 individuals) from the two complementation crosses with Mop1-1 should have a PI-Rh-like anther phenotype. The observed frequency of PI-Rh-like types is not significantly different from the expected frequency for this hypothesis (&square;2&equals;3.3; P &gt;0.05) suggesting that Mop1-4 defines an allele of Mop1. If the Mop1-5 mutation defines an allele of Mop1, then 50% of the complementation cross progeny made with Mop1-1 (9-10 individuals) should have a PI-Rh-like anther phenotype. The observed frequency is not significantly different from this hypothesis (&square;2&equals;0.66; P &gt;0.05) suggesting that Mop1-5 is an allele of Mop1. </paragraph>

Four of the 16 crosses made between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime;; Mop1-4/Mop1-4 plants gave rise to at least one progeny plant with PI-Rh-like anthers (83/278 ACS 1; 117/278 ACS 2; 61/278 ACS 3; 7/278 ACS 4; 4/278 ACS 5; 6/278 ACS 7). Crosses were made to six different homozygous PI-Rh tester stocks to determine if all the pI1 alleles sexually transmitted from PI&prime;/PI&prime;; Mop1-5/Mop1-5 plants remained paramutagenic. One of the 6 crosses made between PI-Rh/PI-Rh testers and PI&prime;/PI&prime;; Mop1-5/Mop1-5 plants gave rise to at least one progeny plant with PI-Rh-like anthers (291100 ACS 1; 55/100 ACS 2; 1/100 ACS 3; 7/100 ACS 4; 2/100 ACS 5; 0/100 ACS 6; 6/100 ACS 7). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0542" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0542&rsqb;</number> Thus, preliminary data indicate that PI&prime; alleles can sometimes change back to a meiotically-heritable, non-paramutagenic or weakly-paramutagenic state in plants homozygous for Mop1-4 and Mop1F-5. </paragraph>

The PI-Rh-like phenotype seen in homozygous Mop1-4 plants co-segregates with obvious developmental abnormalities. Homozygous Mop1-4 plants are &frac13; shorter, on average than their heterozygous siblings. Measurements taken from three independent families in our 2000-2001 winter nursery in Molokai, Hi., show an average height of 69 inches for Mop1-4 heterozygotes and 45 inches for homozygous siblings. In general, the Mop1-4 homozygotes also have a slightly bushier tassel with extra branches and shorter internode distances between the branches. However, dimorphic tassel phenotypes of homozygous Mop1-4 plants have been noted; tassels are smallish, thin, and sparsely adorned with florets in our Hawaii nurseries but relatively normal in our Albany, Calif. nursery. This phenotype is very similar to what has been reported for the Mop1-1 and Mop1-2EMS alleles (Dorweiler et al., 2000). In all other obvious respects, Mop1-4 homozygous plants appear to be normal. </paragraph>

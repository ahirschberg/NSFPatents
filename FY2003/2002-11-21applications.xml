<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Silicon is often used as a semiconductor material for many purposes. The surface of silicon is very chemically active; and easily combines with many materials, including oxygen. The &ldquo;oxide&rdquo; formed on the surface can impede the characteristics of the silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Semiconductors having band gaps between 0.9 and 1.7 eV are often used in photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion devices. Silicon has a band gap of 1.12 eV, and is an especially attractive material for this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A typical way of forming a silicon semiconductor, e.g., a photodiode obtains a hydrogen-terminated Si surface using wet chemical etching with HF (eq). This surface is electrically suitable when initially formed. However, this surface readily oxidizes in air or in water-containing ambients. An oxide on the surface introduces electrical defect states. This also forms an insulating, passivating overlayer. That overlayer can impede the semiconductor characteristics. For example, this can impede photocurrent flow through an electrochemical cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is often important to stabilize Si electrodes in aqueous media. Previous art has suggested coating the surface of Si electrodes with islands or films of metal. This process creates buried Si/metal junctions on protected regions of the electrode. This can be undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Introduction of functional groups onto the Si surface through silanization chemistry can enhance the stability of Si electrodes at low light levels in water with certain redox species. However, the electrical quality of the surface can be compromised by a thin native oxide layer on the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Crystalline Si surfaces have been recently functionalized by chlorination/alkylation or radical-based olefin addition methods. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present specification describes silicon surfaces derivatized with covalently-attached alkyl chains used to protect the surface. A preferred mode uses a halogenation/alkylation procedure in which the surface is treated with a halogen, e.g., chlorine, and then an alkyl-containing material. These materials are preferably electrochemical properties in contact with an aqueous FE(CN)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>3&minus;/4&minus;</superscript></highlight> electrolyte to obtain its electrochemical properties. These surfaces are treated with the alkyl groups, or &ldquo;derivatized.&rdquo; This forms covalent Si&mdash;C linkages and these covalent Si&mdash;C linkages protect the surface against oxidation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A preferred mode uses CH3 as the alkyl group.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The preferred devices are formed using (<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>)-oriented n-type Si single crystals. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows initial steps of first HF-etching and then chlorinating these crystals for 40-50 min at 90-100&deg; C. in a 0.6-0.7 M solution of PCl<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>in chlorobenzene, with benzoyl peroxide added as a radical initiator. This leaves a chlorinated Si surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> While the above describes the halogen treatment being done with chlorine, it should be understood that other halogens could be used, e.g. bromine or iodine or others. Flourine is not preferred as a halogen material since the C&mdash;F bond is strong and may be difficult to displace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows exposure of the chlorinated Si surfaces to an alkyl-containing reagent. For example, the alkyl-containing reagent can be alkyl Li, R&mdash;Li, for example, R&boxH;C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>or alkyl Grignard RM<highlight><subscript>g</subscript></highlight>BR. For example, R&boxH;CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>reagents for 4-12 hours at 65-80&deg; C. More generally, the alkyl-containing reagent can be any C<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2n</subscript></highlight>. This exposure produces an alkylated Si surface with the &ldquo;R&rdquo; group from the alkyl-containing reagent attached to the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> This procedure has been shown by a variety of methods, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared spectroscopy, and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), to produce surficial Si&mdash;C bonds. These bonds protect the surface, and improve its long term stability and semiconductor characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The results are explained with reference to the following. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2a</cross-reference> depicts a high-resolution XP spectrum that was observed for this structure. A H-terminated n-type Si(<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) electrode is placed in contact with 0.35 M K<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>Fe(CN)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>-0.05 </bold></highlight>M K<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Fe(CN)<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(aq) for 10 min at room temperature. The Si 2p XPS peak ratios indicate that approximately three monolayers of oxide were produced on the Si surface during this immersion step, even though negligible light-induced current had passed through the interface. As many as 10 monolayers may exist on this surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows the J-E curves were collected at a scan rate of 50 mV<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>and potentials were recorded in a three-electrode potentiostatic configuration vs a Pt wire reference electrode that was poised at the Nernstian potential of the redox couple, E(A/A<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>). The Si electrode was illuminated with the white light output of an ELH-type tungsten-halogen bulb. As displayed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the first electrochemical current density (J) vs potential (E) scan of this surface, at a light intensity sufficient to produce a short-circuit photocurrent density of 1.0 mA cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>, showed a sigmoidally-shaped curve with a low open-circuit voltage (V<highlight><subscript>oc</subscript></highlight>) and a low fill factor for conversion of incident light into electrical energy. Thus, the electron-hole pairs produced by illumination of the Si resulted in an anodic photocurrent that oxidized the Si surface. Subsequent scans displayed further deterioration in the performance of the electrode with time. Even though this electrolyte solution contained &gt;0.3 M of the hole scavenger Fe(CN)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>4&minus;</superscript></highlight>, oxidation of Si competed effectively with hole scavenging by the redox couple. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A Si electrode tested has been modified by treatment with PCl<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>and then with CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>MgBr. This is immersed in the FE(CN)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>3&minus;/4&minus;</superscript></highlight> solution for 10 min at room temperature. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>depicts a high-resolution XP spectrum for this material. The spectrum suggests that this surface shows less than one monolayer of oxide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). In contrast to the H-terminated Si surface, the initial J-E curve of this electrode showed negligible hysteresis and good rectification with a high fill factor (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). For comparison, n-Si/Au Schottky contacts only produce V<highlight><subscript>oc</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.23 V at these light intensities, and n-SI photoanodes coated with a thin native oxide and then modified with chlorosilylferrocene reagents only produce V<highlight><subscript>oc</subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>-0.30 </bold></highlight>V in contact with the Fe(CN)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>3&minus;/4&minus;</superscript></highlight> electrolyte. Negligible Mg could be detected on the functionalized Si surfaces by XPS, and the photovoltage of the functionalized Si/liquid contact is higher than that for any known direct n-Si/metal contact (owing to the presence of Fermi level pinning at Si/metal contacts). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Thus, the electrochemical properties of this system probably are not based on interaction of a semiconductor/metal Schottky barrier from residual metal deposits on the Si owing to the reaction process. The J-E characteristics of the alkylated surface were also much more stable than those of the H-terminated surface, and the electrochemical properties of such electrodes decayed only very slowly during the passage of anodic photocurrent at this photocurrent density (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The characteristics of the material also depend on the chain length of the alkyl-containing reagent. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>depicts the dependence of the J-E characteristics on that. All of the alkylated Si electrodes show high open-circuit voltages. This indicates that the functionalization step, for any chain length herein investigated has not introduced high levels of electrical recombination sites onto the Si surface. Table 1 shows this relationship. In fact, the observed photovoltages were very close to the optimal values expected from a junction limited only by minority carrier recombination in the bulk of the semiconductor, as opposed to a device dominated by surface recombination or by capture of majority carriers by the redox ions in the electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also indicates that electrodes that had been alkylated with longer chain length reagents showed lower fill factors relative to the fill factor displayed by the methyl-(CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)-terminated Si surface. Functionalization with &mdash;C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>9</subscript></highlight>, for example, produced a unit area series resistance of &tilde;280 cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, as compared to a value of &tilde;17 cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>for a methyl-terminated surface. The larger resistance values degraded the electrochemical performance of the photoelectrode despite a high photovoltage of the system. The increased electrical series resistance displayed by these electrodes is consistent with expectations for an increased charge transfer resistance through thicker alkyl overlayers that has been observed for self-assembled monolayers of thiols on Au surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>displays the J-E characteristics of these functionalized electrodes after they had been maintained at a light-limited current density of 1.0 mA cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>for 60 min. The V<highlight><subscript>oc </subscript></highlight>fill factor of the &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash; and &mdash;C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>&mdash; terminated Si surfaces even at 0.6 V reverse bias after 60 min of illumination in contact with this electrolyte. This shows that two competing factors contribute to the initial stability and the subsequent decay of the J-E characteristics of alkyl-terminated Si surfaces in contact with the Fe(CN)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>3&minus;/4&minus;</superscript></highlight> (aq) solution. The formation of a strong Si&mdash;C bond stabilizes the surface and reduces its propensity toward oxidation. In addition, on the branching ratio between the faradaic current that leads to hole transfer to Fe(CN)<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>4&minus;</superscript></highlight> and that which leads to Si oxidation is sensitive to the packing density, the series resistance, and other structural features of the overlayer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Shorter alkyl groups, therefore, have certain electrochemical advantages. Alkyl groups where n is 1 or 2, and most preferably CH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>therefore, are preferred for electrochemical applications because such overlayers have the least series resistance to interfacial charge transfer. However, longer chains can be more suitable for improving the stability of Si in contact with air, where no faradaic current need flow through the circuit. The behavior displayed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>also indicates the advantages, in certain applications, that are provided by the two-step chlorinational/alkylation procedure. This latter technique provides a facile synthetic route to methylated Si surfaces as well as to surfaces functionalized with longer alkyl chains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, the results described herein demonstrate that the formation of a stable, covalent bond between alkyl chains and silicon surfaces can be used to impart stability to Si surfaces, e.g., photoanodes, against oxidation in contact with an aqueous environment. The improved resistance towards oxidation has been achieved without significant compromises to the electrochemical quality of the silicon surface in contact with these electrolytes. The functionalization strategy can be applied in both aqueous and water-containing gaseous ambients and seems to offer a promising approach to modifying, at the molecular level, the chemical properties of Si surfaces for various possible uses in electrochemical and electronic devices.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to coherent x-ray sources and, more particularly, to the production of energetic, coherent x-rays by interacting select gases with long wavelength light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Coherent x-ray sources are very important for semiconductor, medical and biological industries. Coherent x-ray sources also have wide applications in material studies. Currently, synchrotron radiation is the dominate coherent x-ray source for these applications. Unfortunately, there are only a few synchrotrons in the United States. Furthermore, since it is extremely expensive to build and operate a synchrotron, all of the synchrotrons in the United States are in national laboratories. This severely limits the application of synchrotrons as coherent x-ray sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Recently, another source of coherent x-rays has gained attention. This source uses high order harmonic laser generation to produce coherent x-rays. As compared to synchrotrons, x-ray sources based on high order harmonic generation are much cheaper, much more compact and much easier to operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> X-ray production by high harmonic generation can be understood by a three-step model. First, the bound electrons of atoms tunnel through the Coulomb barrier suppressed by a light field and then the freed electrons move in the light field. Second, when the light field reverses direction, some of the electrons move back towards their parent ions and are accelerated by the light field. Third, when the electrons meet the parent ions, a portion of the electrons recombine with the ions and emit photons. The photon energy equals the kinetic energy that the electrons acquired from the light field plus the ionization potential of the electrons in the atom. For strong light/atom interaction, the recombination emission falls in the x-ray wavelength range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The main cost of an x-ray source based on high harmonic generation is the cost of the high intensity laser. Since the cost of the laser is strongly dependent upon its output power, it is desirable to produce x-rays with the lowest possible laser power. However, it is also desirable to extend the photon energy towards the hard x-ray range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Prior to the present invention, the most effective high harmonic generation method employed lasers with short pulse durations. The shortest harmonics generated so far have a photon energy of about 0.5 keV, which can be used in many applications such as ultrafast fluorescent spectroscopy, biological microscopy and x-ray nonlinear optics. However, great effort is currently being invested to extend high harmonic generation into the keV x-ray regime, where further ground breaking applications would become possible. For example, the short pulse duration and high coherence of keV harmonic sources enable time resolved x-ray spectroscopy experiments on an unprecedented time scale, thereby allowing the observation of fundamental dynamical processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Although short laser pulses such as 5 fs have been used to produce x-rays, reducing the pulse duration increases the lasers intensity. As such, to produce an x-ray, high intensity light pulses with &gt;100 &mgr;J pulse energy are required. Unfortunately, the high laser intensity associated with extremely short pulses and the limitation of the photon energy to the soft x-ray range limits the effectiveness of this technique. Another problem associated with conventional high harmonic generation methods is that these methods only produce radiation in the odd multiples of the fundamental light photon energy. Accordingly, the radiation does not cover all the spectra range between the neighboring orders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In as much as a 5 fs laser pulse is on the order of one optical cycle, this is almost the shortest pulse producible. As such, it is unlikely that high harmonic generation studies will be furthered by continuing efforts in this smaller laser pulse direction. One alternative direction previously considered involves reducing the size of the laser spot. However, this method has also been deemed unacceptable since it causes phase-matching problems. Another alternative direction involves high harmonic generation from ions or from core electrons. However, these techniques are yet to be confirmed by experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, a novel technique is described that dramatically extends the cut-off photon energy of given atoms and is capable of producing keV x-rays. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It has been discovered that x-rays can be produced by generating high harmonic radiation with long wavelength light. In order to produce the most energetic x-ray, the electrons should gain as much energy as possible from the light field during one optical cycle. For a given potential field, the kinetic energy that an object acquires is proportional to the square of the time that the object travels in the field. Since one optical period is the longest time that the electrons can be accelerated in the light field, light having a long optical cycle should be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Since wavelength is proportional to optical period, the use of long wavelength light increases the acceleration time of the electron in the field. Keeping the atomic species and light intensity unchanged, x-ray photon energy increases by a factor of two to four when the fundamental wavelength increases by a factor of two. As such, a given photon energy x-ray can be produced at half or a quarter laser intensity by using long wavelength light as compared to conventional short wavelength light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed towards a novel method of producing coherent x-rays. The method involves interacting gases with long wavelength light pulses from an optical parametric amplifier to produce a given wavelength x-ray. Advantageously, the wavelength of the x-ray produced by this method can be tuned to match the x-ray optics in the desired final application by changing the wavelength of the light from the optical parametric amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition to the foregoing, the present method also has the potential to produce hard x-rays which cannot be produced with short wavelength light. Also, by using long wavelength light, the pulse energy requirement of the light reduces by a factor of 2 to 4 as compared with using conventional short wavelength light pulses. This greatly reduces the cost of the x-ray source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As will be described in detail below, x-ray photon energy can be increased by interacting atoms with long wavelength light. In one experiment, 1.5 &mgr;m wavelength light was produced by an optical parametric amplifier. This wavelength is nearly twice the 0.8 &mgr;m wavelength light of high intensity lasers commonly used for high harmonic generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Using xenon as the interaction gas, high harmonics were produced with a photon energy up to &tilde;80 eV using the 1.5 &mgr;m light. This is much higher than the highest photon energy (45 eV) ever produced with 0.8 &mgr;m laser. Further, the intensity of the 1.5 &mgr;m light is only 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. To produce such x-rays with a 0.8 &mgr;m laser, the intensity would be twice as high. With argon gas, the highest photon energy is 160 eV with the 1.5 &mgr;m pump as compared to 64 eV with the 0.8 &mgr;m laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the light from the optical parametric amplifier is tunable. As such, the wavelength of x-ray can be tuned to cover the spectra between neighboring harmonics. This is crucial for x-ray lithography in the semiconductor industry. The bandwidth of the mirrors used for lithography is narrow and there is no guarantee that the x-ray produced by a fixed wavelength laser will fall at the peak of the reflection. With the optical parametric amplifier, the x-ray can be tuned to use the x-ray mirror most effectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an apparatus for generating an x-ray with a long wavelength source is illustrated. The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a long wavelength light source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an optical member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as a lens or mirror. An area <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is filled with gas <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> such as argon, xenon or helium. Although other wavelengths may be suitable, it is presently preferred to provide long wavelength source which produces wavelengths between about 0.8 and about 1.6 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The long wavelength light source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produces high power light pulses in the form of a beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The light beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is focused by the optical member <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (lens or mirror) to the area <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> filled with gas <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The light intensity is such that it is high enough to ionize the gas <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. X-ray pulses <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are produced as a result of the light/gas interaction. For a given gas and light intensity, the long wavelength light <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> produces high photon energy in the x-ray <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> schematic analogy of electron acceleration in a light field is illustrated. The movement of an electron in a field of light is similar to a ball <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> falling along a slope <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. When the wavelength of the light is doubled, it is equivalent to doubling the time for the ball <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to fall. This quadruples the kinetic energy of the ball <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the same way, the electron gains four times the energy in the field of light with wavelength &lgr;/2 than in the field of light with wavelength &lgr;. The more energy the electron receives, the higher the photon energy of the x-ray emitted when recombined with the parent ion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> comparison of calculated spectra from xenon gas interacting with 0.8 &mgr;m and 1.6 &mgr;m light is illustrated. The simulation is based on the Lewenstein model, which is the quantum mechanics treatment of the above mentioned three-step model of high harmonic generation. The Lewenstein model is valid for the calculation of harmonics with photon energy much higher than the ionization potential, which is suitable for the present case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the results clearly show the advantage of producing x-rays with long wavelength light. The photon energy produced by the 1.6 &mgr;m light is twice as large as the photon energy produced by the 0.8 &mgr;m light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, another apparatus for generating x-rays with long wavelength light is shown. The apparatus <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes an optical parametric amplifier <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for producing a beam <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The beam is focused by a lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (or mirror) toward a gas stream produced by a gas jet <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. An x-ray spectrometer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is positioned to receive and analyze the resultant x-ray <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In an experimental run, an optical parametric amplifier <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (OPA800, Spectraphysics) capable of generating both signal and idler beams was employed. The amplifier <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> was set so as to yield a signal beam <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> tunable from 1 to 1.6 &mgr;m. The pulse energy of the signal beam <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from the amplifier <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> was 30 &mgr;J. The signal beam <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> was focused toward the gas by a 100 mm lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The focal spot size was &tilde;20 &mgr;m FWHM. The intensity of the beam <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at the focus was &tilde;1&times;10<highlight><superscript>14 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The gas density from the pulsed gas jet <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> was &tilde;1&times;10<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. The interaction length was &tilde;200 &mgr;m. A transmission grating spectrometer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> was used to measure the resultant x-ray <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The spectrometer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can measure x-rays from 15 to 1000 eV. The dispersed x-ray <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> was detected by an MCP image intensifier and a 16 bit CCD camera (neither shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows experimental results with argon gas. The optical parametric amplifier pulse energy for this experiment was measured to be 100 &mgr;J before the interaction chamber. In the measurement, 0.2 &mgr;m Al or B filters were used to suppress the noise by the high order grating diffraction of the low order harmonics. Results with an Al filter (thin line) and a B filter (thick line) are both illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). As can be seen, the cut-off is at &tilde;160 eV with the B filter. The harmonic peaks above 70 eV are not resolved due to the resolution of the x-ray spectrometer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This portion of radiation can be blocked by the Al filter as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For comparison, the high harmonic generation by 0.8 &mgr;m laser was measured under the same conditions. The focal spot size is also kept at 20 &mgr;m and pulse energy &tilde;100 &mgr;J. The result is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), in which the cut-off is located at &tilde;64 eV, much lower than that produced by the 1.51 &mgr;m laser. The spacing between adjacent harmonic peaks by the 1.51 &mgr;m driving field is about half of that by the 0.8 &mgr;m pump laser. This makes full tunability easier for the long wavelength driving field. By applying the same method as described above to helium gas, coherent x-rays above 1 keV should be producible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Although the x-ray source of the present invention will find usefulness in a myriad of applications, it may be particularly well suited for x-ray lithography in semiconductor chip manufacturing, x-ray microscopy imaging in medical and biology studies, as well as potential use in material studies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The following presents an experimental demonstration for extending the high order harmonic cut-off photon energy by more than a factor of two when the driving field wavelength is changed from 0.8 &mgr;m to 1.51 &mgr;m with an optical parametric amplifier. With argon gas, the cut-off has been extended from 64 eV to &tilde;160 eV. Coherent keV x-rays should be generated by exciting helium gas with such long wavelength driving pulses. Experiments on xenon gas with several pump wavelengths also showed the dramatic cut-off extension, as well as full tunability of the generated x-ray (xuv) wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The following experimental conditions fall into the tunneling regime, in which the dependence of cut-off photon energy on a laser pulse parameter and an atomic parameter is described by equation 1:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> I and m are the orbital and magnetic quantum number. n* is the effective principle quantum number, I*&equals;I&minus;n*. p&equals;98% is the ionization probability at the peak of the pulse. a&equals;0.5 is a correction of the analytical approximation. The results calculated with this formula agree well with the experimental results obtained by 0.8 &mgr;m laser interacting with various atomic species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As described above, previous extension of the cut-off photon energy has been successfully achieved by interacting atoms with ultrashort driving pulses, as indicated by Eq. (1). Pulses as short as 5-7 fs have been employed and successfully generated 0.5 keV x-ray emission. However, since such pulses are already approaching one optical cycle, it is very hard to push the cut-off significantly by further reducing the laser pulse. According to Eq. (1), the cut-off photon energy strongly depends on the ionization potential. In fact, the record cut-off was achieved with helium which has the largest ionization potential among all atoms. Ions can give even larger ionization potential, which offers another possibility to significantly extend the cut-off as shown by several simulations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Another significant parameter in Eq. (1) is the wavelength of the driving pulse. That is, the cut-off photon energy for a given atomic state is almost proportional to the square of the wavelength. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the calculation results of the relationship between single atom cut-off with the driving field wavelength. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows that by changing the driving field wavelength from 0.8 &mgr;m to 1.6 &mgr;m, the cut-off of helium is extended from &tilde;0.5 keV to &tilde;2 keV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The measured cut-off with the 0.8 and 1.51 &mgr;m pumps illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are both lower than the single atom calculation results in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. This can be accounted for by the macroscopic effect of the harmonic generation process. It is well know that the measured harmonic signal is strongly affected by the phase matching. In the ionized medium, the phase match length is determined by the focusing, dispersion and intensity-dependent phase. The Rayleigh range of the focused pump beam is less than ten times the gas medium length. Therefore, the effect of Guoy phase shift and intensity-dependent phase should be significant. At the tested gas pressure and laser intensity, the dispersion and defocusing of plasma affect the harmonic yield. In general, these effects are stronger for higher orders, which limited the observed cutoff order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the tunneling ionization process, the ionization rate is independent of the laser wavelength. Therefore the saturation intensity is the same for pulses with the same duration but different wavelengths. As a result, electrons experience the same field strength at saturation intensities for pulses with different wavelengths. The kinetic energy of an electron acquired in a given potential field is proportional to the square of the travel time in the field. Therefore, the electrons can gain more energy in a longer optical period field, i.e., a longer wavelength field, to generate higher harmonics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> long wavelength driven experiment was performed with a tabletop Ti:Sapphire laser system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> used with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The generated high harmonic generation signal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is measured by a transmission grating based x-ray spectrometer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The OPA <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> pumped by 25 fs, 1.2 mJ sub-kHz laser pulses centered at 0.8 &mgr;m, generates tunable 1.1 to 1.6 &mgr;m IR laser pulses with pulse energy ranging from 30 to 100 &mgr;J. The duration of the OPA <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is also 25 fs as measured by an autocorrelator. The output <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of OPA <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is focused by an 88.3 mm lens <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> onto the pulsed gas jet <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed by a gas nozzle <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> synchronized with the laser signal. The focal spot size is &tilde;20 &mgr;m FWHM. The gas density from the pulsed jet is &tilde;1&times;10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>in a 200 &mgr;m interaction region. The harmonics from the gas are imaged by a focusing mirror <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> at grazing incidence onto a chevron MCP imaging detector <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which has a good sensitivity to wavelengths below 140 nm. A 2000 l/mm transmission grating <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is employed to disperse the spectrum. Finally, The x-ray spectrum on the phosphor screen is recorded by a 16 bit cooled CCD camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, to evaluate the macroscopic effects on the harmonic generation with long wavelength light, the harmonic spectra were simulated using parameters that mimic the experimental conditions. First, the single atom response is calculated using the method developed by Becker et al in Physical Review A, 41, 4112 (1990). The result is then put into the wave equation to calculate the harmonic signal from the gas. The simulation was done for argon gas with 2 &mgr;m and 200 &mgr;m medium lengths by the 1.51 &mgr;m pump. The result is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As is shown, the cut-off reaches as high as 225 eV under the short medium length (2 &mgr;m) case, where the phase mismatch is not a big problem. When the medium length increases to 200 &mgr;m, the cut-off was &tilde;180 eV, which is lower than the 2 &mgr;m case. This implies that phase matching plays an important role under the above-described experimental conditions. This can be improved by loose focusing the pump beam and operating the system at low pressures or by using a hollow-core fiber technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Experiments have also been done with xenon gas. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the results with xenon gas at several wavelengths. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is the result produced by a fundamental 0.8 &mgr;m laser. FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) are the results produced by the output from an optical parametric amplifier tuned at 1.51 &mgr;m, 1.37 &mgr;m and 1.22 &mgr;m, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> clearly illustrates the cut-off dependence on the driving field wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> At a given harmonic order, the intensity of the harmonic signal decreases with an increase of pump wavelength. The intensities of the 37th high harmonic generation peaks in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) were estimated. The relative intensity ratio of the spectral line for 1.22, 1.37 and 1.51 &mgr;m pumps are roughly 1:0.69:0.25. This can be accounted for by the effect of the quantum diffusion of the wave packet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As described by the above semiclassic three-step model, the harmonics are generated by the recombination of the previously ionized electrons. The high harmonic generation intensity is proportional to the probability of the recombination, which is strongly affected by the overlap of the returning wave packet and the Coulomb potential well. A longer wavelength driving field causes a longer propagation time which leads to a bigger wave packet because of quantum diffusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The wave packet spreads with its propagation time &tgr; as &tgr;<highlight><superscript>{fraction (3/2)}</superscript></highlight>, and harmonic intensity decreases by the square of this factor. Calculations based on this relationship show that the intensity ratio is 1:0.71:0.53 for the same order high harmonic generation peaks produced by 1.22, 1.37 and 1.51 &mgr;m pumps. The first ratio 1:0.71 for 1.22 and 1.37 &mgr;m pumps is close to the measured value (1:0.69). However, the calculated relative intensity for 1.51 &mgr;m pump is almost twice the measured value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The discrepancy between the measured and calculated results is likely caused by both the precision of the experiments and the calculation since the analytical calculation neglects the real Coulomb potential of atoms. Compared to the measurements of harmonic efficiency and nonsequential ionization with elliptically polarized light, the method demonstrated here provides a powerful way to study quantum diffusion of the wave packet in the strong field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of using an optical parametric amplifier is tunability, which consequently gives the tunability of the generated high harmonic generation emission. It is well know that conventional high harmonic generation produces only odd harmonics except when the pump pulses are close to single cycle. For spectroscopic applications, it is highly desirable to tune the harmonic peak positions to hit the resonance of the matter to be studied. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the photon energy range covered by the 37<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>harmonic of 1.22 &mgr;m and the same harmonic order of the 1.51 &mgr;m is much larger than the gap between two adjacent odd harmonic orders of either driving field. That means one can tune the harmonic to any position in the gap. In fact, full tunability can be realized at much lower harmonic orders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Assume the optical parametric amplifier output can be tuned between &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. If the qth harmonic of &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>can be tuned to the adjacent harmonic of &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, i.e. &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/q&equals;&lgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/(q&plus;2), the high harmonic generation spectrum above &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>/q will be fully tunable. Since the experimental optical parametric amplifier can be tuned between 1.1 to 1.6 &mgr;m, the above equation gives q&equals;5. Therefore, the high harmonic generation source pumped by this optical parametric amplifier is completely tunable between 1.1/5&equals;0.22 &mgr;m up to the cut-off. This is the first demonstration of full tunability in the soft x-ray range with an optical parametric amplifier. Compared to the previously proposed tuning scheme with wave mixing that requires precise temporal and spatial overlap of the strong fixed wavelength pulses and the tunable weak optical parametric amplifier pulses, the method demonstrated here is much simpler. It should also be noticed that the wave mixing experiments so far only show partial tuning, e.g. &lt;70% of the gap between adjacent orders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, high harmonic generation is performed in the 1.2 to 1.5 &mgr;m pump wavelength range using an ultrafast high intensity optical parametric amplifier. This type of optical parametric amplifier can also be used to study other nonperturbative responses of matter to the long wavelength field. The results show that using a long wavelength pump is a very effective way to extend the cutoff of harmonic radiation. Ultrafast coherent keV x-rays should be able to be generated by further increasing the intensity of the optical parametric amplifier and interacting the light with atoms with larger ionization potential. Even longer wavelength driving fields will also lead to further extension of the harmonic cutoff, which can be done with the idler signal of the optical parametric amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that a compromise must be made between harmonic intensity and wavelength range. The experiments show that the harmonic signal is weaker for a longer wavelength driving field which is consistent with the semiclassic three-step theory. The intensity difference of the same order harmonics produced by several wavelength pumps is attributed to the effect of quantum diffusion. The harmonic radiation generated by an optical parametric amplifier is fully tunable from VUV to x-ray. Just like optical parametric amplifiers are currently significant to spectroscopy studied in the UV to IR range, the tunable x-ray source will have a large impact on applications of ultrafast coherent x-ray. </paragraph>

Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a method for generating high-energy particles using high-intensity short laser pulses and, more particularly, to a method for inducing nuclear reactions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are a number of radioisotopes that are currently being utilized as markers and for other purposes in various medical, scientific, industrial and other applications. However, radioisotopes frequently have a relatively short half-life, from a few hours to a few minutes. Therefore it is generally desirable that such radioisotopes be either produced at the site where they are going to be utilized, or at a site relatively close thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The short-lived radioisotopes are administered by intravenous injection or by having the subject inhale a gas containing small quantities of the radioisotope. Isotopes which are often incorporated into such gases or injection are carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxygen, and fluorine-18. In Positron Emission Tomography (PET) facilities, these radioisotopes are derived from boron, carbon, nitrogen, and neon targets, respectively, by bombarding the targets with high-energy (approximately 6-30 MeV) protons or deuterons obtained from a particle accelerator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The particle accelerator that is conventionally used to produce the isotope-generating particles is a cyclotron accelerator. Unfortunately, cyclotron accelerators suitable for use in the medical environment are very expensive (on the order of 1-2 million dollars), large and heavy (15-20 tons) and require a trained staff to operate and maintain the apparatus. Thus, the accelerator must be physically located in a medical center located within a short distance from the PET scanning apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the high-energy particles produced by the cyclotron accelerator are generally used to bombard gas targets to obtain the isotopes. Gas targets must be separated from the high vacuum of the accelerator by a metallic foil window. Unfortunately, if the particles are accelerated with very high energies, the window is rapidly destroyed, thus increasing the cost of maintenance and requiring highly trained operators who must disassemble the device to replace the window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is desireable to provide a method and apparatus for generating high-energy particles to induce nuclear reactions, thereby instantly producing radioisotopes. Moreover, it is desireable to provide such a method and apparatus that can be practically used for real-world medical applications and in low cost. For example, a method for generating high-energy ions would be beneficial for cancer hadron therapy because of the possible decrease in absorbed radiation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system for generating high-energy particles and for inducing nuclear reactions. The system includes a laser for emitting a laser beam, an irradiation target for receiving the laser beam and producing high-energy particles, and a secondary target for receiving the high-energy particles, thereby inducing a nuclear reaction. A filter and a monitor may be installed to estimate the energy of the high-energy particles, however these elements are not necessary to induce nuclear reactions and can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a method for generating high-energy particles and for inducing nuclear reactions. The steps of the method include producing a laser beam of high-intensity with an ultra-short pulse duration, irradiating the laser beam onto an irradiation target in order to ionize the irradiation target and produce a collimated beam of high-energy particles, and colliding the collimated beam of high-energy particles onto a secondary target containing a nuclei,thereby inducing a nuclear reaction in the secondary target. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed towards a method for generating high-energy particles which are then used to produce nuclear reactions. The method can supply X-ray, electron beam, ion beam and radioisotopes used in radiation therapy, medical radioisotope production, and material diagnostics. The present invention also makes nuclear devices available for applications such as medical diagnosis like positron emission tomography, material inspection, nuclear transformation, and nuclear reaction simulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a laser and laser irradiation equipment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> emitting a laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is disposed downstream from the laser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and in radiation receiving relation to the beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is comprised of a thin film <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as a Mylar film having a thickness of about 10 micrometers, coated with a plastic layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, such as a deuterated plastic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Upon bombardment with the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> produces a collimated beam of high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are accelerated toward a secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> disposed downstream of the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contains nuclei and is enriched with, for example, boron-10 up to 90% in concentration, thereby inducing a nuclear reaction. This nuclear reaction allows for the production of radioisotopes and alpha particles. The secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may also take the form of a patient in the case of radiation therapy such as cancer hadron treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably located axially offset from the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and on the opposite side as the laser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes an activation region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> where the nuclear reaction is localized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Although not required, the activation region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is preferably a planar member oriented normal to a central axis of the cone of high energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Although the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a thin film solid, gas jets can be used as the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. For example, super sonic gas jets can be irradiated by the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> enriched with boron-10 can be a solid, liquid jet, or a droplet jet target of some other element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the operation of the present invention will be described. At step S<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, the laser and laser irradiation equipment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is turned on. In step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is irradiated with the ultra-short high-intensity laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This results in the generation of high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> collide with the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing nuclei in the activation region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This induces a nuclear reaction in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. At step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the method ends or can be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the method will be described in greater detail. The laser and irradiation laser equipment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> focuses a laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on a small focusing area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by focusing optics. The laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably has an intensity greater than 10<highlight><superscript>18 </superscript></highlight>W/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and a pulse duration shorter than 10 picoseconds. This allows for an instant production of particles with high energies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The concentrated energy of the focused laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> ionizes the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which raises the temperature of the target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and then produces plasmas that consists of free electrons and ions. The electrons are then expelled and accelerated from the small focusing area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to high energies by very strong electro-magnetic fields or light pressure from the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The expelling may also be due to a plurality of traveling plasma waves induced by the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or stimulated scattering produced by the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> hitting the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The small region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> where plasmas are produced is preferably less than about 1 mm, thereby making it possible to obtain a radiation shielding area smaller than the radiation shielding areas required in conventional accelerators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Once the electrons are expelled from the target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the ions are left due to their large inertia. This produces a charge separation, which in turn produces an electric field. The ions having a pulse duration shorter than 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>are accelerated by the electric field to high energy levels, for example greater than 100 keV, due to the high intensity of the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that produces the large electric field. This results in the generation of high-energetic particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The charge separation is sustained until electrons coming from the areas surrounding region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> neutralize the charge separation. The direction of the high-energy ion emission is preferably limited within some angle, for example 40 degrees, around the normal direction of the surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This simplifies the use of the high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Under the above circumstances, the electric field exceeds 10 GeV/cm. As such, the acceleration length is 5 to 6 orders of magnitude shorter than conventional accelerators. The number of ions accelerated exceeds 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>particles, proving a peak current of a few kilo-amperes, which is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than what conventional accelerators produce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As described above, the high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> emitted toward the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> placed behind the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> induce nuclear reactions. That is, the bombardment of the particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> produces positron active isotopes. However, it should be noted that nuclear reactions are also capable of being induced within the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in which case the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably has a pulse duration less than 10 pico-seconds. When the pulse duration is longer than 10 pico-seconds, the diffusion of ions produced by the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> starts before the end of the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the charge separation region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is not able to grow large enough to accelerate the ions up to a high energy level, which is desired. On the other hand, a pulse duration less than 10 pico-seconds makes for a larger charge separation, thus making a higher electric field, which is required for the production of high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a graph illustrating the relationship between the laser beam intensity (laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and the maximum energy of the generated ions (particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). As can be seen, by irradiating the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, positive ions can be generated as high energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and accelerated up to high energy levels such as 10 MeV. These levels are not attainable with conventional cyclotrons. Nonetheless, it is not always necessary to accelerate the high-energy particles 20 to 10 MeV. For example, 100 keV would be enough energy to accelerate certain particles to induce a nuclear reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> One type of laser and irradiation equipment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> used is the hybrid Ti:Al2O3/Nd:phosphate glass CPA laser with a power of 10 TW. This type of laser is able to emit a laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with 0.4 picosecond pulse duration and about 3 Joules of energy. To accomplish this, the laser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> first stretches laser pulses emitted from an oscillator by a pulse stretcher, then amplifies these stretched pulses by amplifiers, and finally increases the peak intensity by compressing the pulse duration by a pulse compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, this ultra-short pulse with a high peak intensity is focused by focusing optics, and is irradiated onto the deuterated plastic layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be irradiated onto the deuterated plastic layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a focusing diameter of 10 micrometers. Of course other types of lasers and irradiation equipment may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Although not shown in the figures, shields can be placed around the activation region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in order to contain the radiation. Since the ultra-short pulse laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used to generate the high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for inducing the nuclear reactions, the size of the entire above-described apparatus is relatively small. As such, any shield employed can be simple compared with the method of inducing nuclear reactions using nuclear reactors and accelerators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The control of nuclear reactions is made easy by the present invention because nuclear reactions are induced by irradiation of the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the laser and laser equipment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The laser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably has an on/off feature that can start and stop the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is used for the production of the nuclear reactions. Also, by adjusting the focusing intensity and the energy of the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the energy of the generated high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be controlled, and therefore nuclear reactions can be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> One way to detect the energy of the high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is by installing a filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> made of, for example, Polyethylene Terephthalate and a monitor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Preferably, these elements are disposed downstream of the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on an opposite side as the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the monitor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are used to estimate the energy of the high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> irradiated onto the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> More particularly, only particles with certain energy levels will penetrate the entire thickness of the filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. If the monitor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> detects particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> behind filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, then the particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> achieved a given energy or more. For example, energy of about 1 MeV is necessary for protons to penetrate the filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with a 10 micron thickness. Therefore, when the monitor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> detects protons, the proton energies are greater than 1 MeV. Of course, the filter <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the monitor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are not necessary to generate high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or induce nuclear reactions and therefore do not have to be installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The production of radioisotopes by a nuclear fusion reaction with the present invention will now be discussed in greater detail. In this example, the plastic layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made of deuterated plastic. Further, the secondary target is made of boron-10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Ion particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which are streams of positive ions, are emitted from target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with an angle of about 40 degrees. More particularly, the ion particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> irradiate from the deuterated plastic layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and thus produce high energy ion particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of deuteron. The high-energy deuteron particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then collide with the boron-10 secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Thus, a nuclear reaction 10B(d,n)11C inside the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is induced. Because of this, carbon11 (11C), which is a radioisotope, and neutrons(n) are produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Usually, nuclear reactions are induced in the region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located between the surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a depth of about 1 mm. Therefore, the produced carbon-11 absolutely remains inside the target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In another example, the deuterated plastic layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be omitted from the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and normal boron instead of boron-10, can be used as the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this case, protons are mainly generated as high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> irradiates the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The nuclear reaction in this case, 11B(p,n)11C, can be induced when the high energy proton particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> collide with the boron enriched secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Once again, carbon-11, which is a radioisotope, and neutrons are produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The produced carbon-11 is a pure positron emitter with a half-life of20 minutes and can be used for diagnostics in medicine and defect diagnostics for materials. Carbon-11 is more manageable as a nuclear material than natrium-22 because the radioactivity of carbon-11 decays so much, even in one night due to its short half-life of 20 minutes. Carbon-11 of 2 nano-curie can be produced by one pulse with the aforementioned energy of the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Carbon-11 of 10 micro-curie can also be produced when the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is irradiated with a 10-Hz pulse repetition rate for 1 hour. This radioactivity is the same level as that from a commercial natrium-22 as a calibration source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Although the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has been described as generating high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, high energy X-rays can also be generated. The high intensity laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> passes through the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the generated X-rays are emitted in a direction normal to the surface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> irradiated by the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and opposite the laser and laser irradiation equipment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When the X-rays have energies higher than 1.02 MeV, an electron and a positron can be produced. This is done through the interaction of the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and other materials. Therefore, electrons, X-rays and positrons can be generated as high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be positive ions that can induce nuclear fusion or nuclear fission with other materials inside the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Nuclear reactions such as (gamma, n) can be induced by the gamma-rays generated from the above-mentioned nuclear reactions. This nuclear reaction can also produce isotopes and neutrons, which are used in medicine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that by changing the combinations of the materials of the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, many reactions other than the ones mentioned above, (10B(b,n)11C and 11B(p,n)11C), can be produced. As one example, by using a material containing hydrogen for the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, protons (p) can be generated as the high energy positive ion particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. By colliding these high energy proton particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing nitrogen-14, the nuclear fusion 14N(p,alpha)11C can be induced, and carbon-11, which is a radioisotope with a short half-life, and alpha particles can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Other combinations include colliding protons as the high energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing oxygen-16. This can induce the nuclear fusion 160(p,alpha)13N, and nitrogen-13, which is a radioisotope with a short half-life, and alpha particles can be produced. By colliding protons as the high energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing oxygen-18, the nuclear fusion 18(p,n)18F can be induced, and fluorine-18, which is a radioisotope with a short half-life, and neutrons can be produced. By colliding protons as the high energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing boron, the nuclear fusion 10B(p,alpha)7 Be can be induced, and Beryllium-7, which is a radioisotope with a short half-life, and alpha particles can be produced. By colliding protons as high energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing nitrogen-15, the nuclear fusion 15N(p,n)15O can be induced, and oxygen-15, which is a radioisotope with a short half-life, and neutrons can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> By using an irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> containing deuterium, deuterons are mainly generated as the high-energy positive ion paticles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Therefore, by colliding these high energy deuterons with a secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing carbon-12, the nuclear 12C(d,n) 13N can be induced, and nitrogen-13, which is a radioisotope with a short half-life, and neutrons can be produced. By colliding deuterons as the high energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing nitrogen-14, the nuclear fusion 14N(d,n)15<highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> O can be induced, and oxygen-15, which is a radioisotope with a short half-life, and neutrons can be produced. By colliding deuterons as the high energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with a target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> containing neon-20, the nuclear fusion 20Ne(d,alpha)18F can be induced, and fluorine-18, which is a radioisotope with a short half-life, and alpha particles can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The energy of the particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generated by the irradiation of the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (such as X-rays and positive ions) can be more than the threshold energy for nuclear fissions, so the nuclear reaction can be easily induced. For example, by using materials containing hydrogen as the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the materials containing uranium as the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and by colliding the high energy proton particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with 10 MeV onto the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, nuclear fission of uranium can be induced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Additionally, by colliding the high-energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generated from the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> onto the nuclei inside the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the nuclei can be excited, thus producing a nuclear isomer. The nuclear isomer can change from an exited nuclear isomer state to a stable state, thus obtaining a gamma ray source with a line spectral profile, which can be developed into a gamma-ray laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Although the aforementioned examples are among the most used examples, there are many applications for using this invention. For example, although the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are different and separated in the examples above, the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the secondary target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be merged, and a nuclear reaction can be induced with nuclei inside the common target irradiated by the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, the region where nuclear reaction is induced can be limited to the small region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> close to the laser focusing area <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> irradiated by the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Moreover, although the high energy particles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are mainly protons and deuterons in the above mentioned examples, triton can be used, and a mixture of these particles can also be used. Further, the laser beam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be irradiated onto the irradiation target <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> repetitively with a pulse interval shorter than the half-life of the products by nuclear reactions. Therefore, the amount of isotopes with a short half-life can be increased by accumulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">One-dimensional nanostructures having uniform diameters of less than approximately 200 nm. These inventive nanostructures, which we refer to as &ldquo;nanowires&rdquo;, include single-crystalline homostructures as well as heterostructures of at least two single-crystalline materials having different chemical compositions. Because single-crystalline materials are used to form the heterostructure, the resultant heterostructure will be single-crystalline as well. The nanowire heterostructures are generally based on a semiconducting wire wherein the doping and composition are controlled in either the longitudinal or radial directions, or in both directions, to yield a wire that comprises different materials. Examples of resulting nanowire heterostructures include a longitudinal heterostructure nanowire (LOHN) and a coaxial heterostructure nanowire (COHN). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains generally to nanostructures, and more particularly to a substantially crystalline nanowire structure having a diameter along the wire axis which varies by less than approximately 10% over a section exhibiting the maximum change in diameter, and which has a diameter of less than approximately 200 nm. The nanowire structure can be formed as a homostructure, as a heterostructure, and as combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The ability to efficiently convert energy between different forms (e.g., thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> creates the infrastructure of any modern economy and is one of the most recognizable symbols of advances in science and engineering. Optoelectronics, for example, deals with the conversion between optical and electronic forms, which has laid the foundation for many aspects of modern information technology. Conversion between thermal energy and electrical power is the hallmark of the energy economy, where even marginal improvements in efficiency and conversion methods can have enormous impact on both monetary savings, energy reserves, and the environment. Similarly, electromechanical energy conversion lies at the heart of many modern machines and sensors, which have found widespread use in technology. Given its importance, it is natural to ask whether nanoscale science and engineering can play any role in energy conversion. Clearly, in view of the continuing quest for miniaturization and increased efficiency of devices, nanoscale devices can play a role in energy conversion. Accordingly, there is a need for a broad spectrum of high performance energy conversion devices based on one-dimensional inorganic nanostructures or nanowires. The present invention satisfies that need, as well as others, and overcomes deficiencies inherent in conventional devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains generally to nanostructures which are substantially crystalline, and more particularly to one-dimensional nanostructures having a diameter along the longitudinal axis which does not vary by more than approximately 10% over the section exhibiting the maximum change in diameter, and having a diameter of less than approximately 200 nm at the point of maximum diameter. These inventive nanostructures, which we refer to as &ldquo;nanowires&rdquo;, preferably comprise substantially monocrystalline homostructures, as well as heterostructures of at least one substantially crystalline material and one other material where an interface or junction is formed therebetween. Heterostructures according to the present invention can also include combinations of homostructures and heterostructures. In the event that substantially crystalline materials are used to form the heterostructure, the resultant heterostructure will be substantially crystalline as well. Additionally, nanowires according to the invention can have various cross-sectional shapes, including, but not limited, to circular, square, rectangular and hexagonal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Heterostructures can be formed with any number of segments, both longitudinally and coaxially, where adjacent segments are substantially crystalline or where a substantially crystalline segment is adjacent to a material which is not substantially crystalline. Many of the nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention are generally based on a semiconducting wire wherein the doping and composition are controlled in either the longitudinal or radial directions, or in both directions, to yield a wire that comprises different materials. Segments of heterostructures can be various materials, including, for example, semiconductor materials which are doped or intrinsic and arranged to form a variety of semiconductor devices with junctions such as pn, pnp, npn, pin, pip and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> By way of further example, according to an aspect of the invention, the nanowire could comprise different materials when viewed longitudinally, such as would be the case with alternating or periodic segments of different materials or multi-segmented nanowires where at least two of the segments comprise different materials. We refer to this configuration as a longitudinal heterostructure nanowire (LOHN). An example would be a LOHN where adjacent segments have different chemical compositions such as Si and SiGe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, the nanowire would be a coaxial-type structure, comprising a core of a first material surrounded by a jacket of a second material. We refer to this configuration as a coaxial heterostructure nanowire (COHN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The junctions between the compositionally substantially crystalline materials defining nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention typically exhibit a high degree of sharpness. For example, in accordance with the present invention, the interface between these materials can be made as sharp as approximately one atomic layer to approximately 20 nm. However, since heterostructures according to the present invention can comprise multiple segments either longitudinally, coaxially, or both, it is also possible to form heterostructures where some junctions exhibit a high degree of sharpness and others do not depending upon the particular application and need. Furthermore, not only can the composition of the materials forming adjacent segments be sharp or gradual, but by controlling the doping of materials forming segments of the heterostructure, it is possible to have sharp or gradual dopant transition between segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments of the present invention, the nanostructures of this invention expressly exclude structures comprising carbon nanotubes and/or structures comprising what are commonly referred to as &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; or &ldquo;nano-whiskers&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that various configurations can be achieved using the foregoing inventive structures, some of which have been previously described. By way of further example, and not of limitation, these configurations can include single and multiple junction LOHNs, single and multiple junction COHNs, combinations of LOHN and COHN structures, two-terminal configurations, N&gt;2 terminal configurations, combinations of heterostructures and homostructures, homostructures with one or more electrodes (which would also be an overall heterostructure), heterostructures with one or more electrodes, homostructures with insulators, heterostructures with insulators, and the like. It will also be appreciated that the interface between a nanowire and a terminal constitutes a heterojunction. A variety of devices can be fabricated using these structures and configurations, including, but not limited to, phonon bandgap devices, quantum dots that confine electrons in specific areas, thermoelectric devices (e.g., solid state refrigerators and engines), photonic devices (e.g., nanolasers), nanoelectromechanical (MEM) devices (electromechanical actuators and sensors), energy conversion devices of various forms including for example, light to mechanical energy or thermal energy to light, and other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a process for fabricating nanowires has been developed. In particular, this aspect of the invention includes a process for making a population of nanowire heterostructures with a substantially monodisperse distribution of diameters if the distribution of diameters within the population is less than or equal to approximately 50% rms, more preferably less than or equal to 20% rms, and most preferably less than 10% rms. A further aspect of the invention comprises a process for forming populations of nanowires with a substantially monodisperse distribution of lengths. A population of nanowires is considered to have a monodisperse distribution of lengths in the distribution of lengths within the population is less than or equal to 20% rms, more preferably less than or equal to 10% rms, more preferably less than or equal to 5% rms, and most preferably less than 1%. A further aspect of the invention comprises a design for nanowires that permits batch fabrication in large quantities. Another aspect of the invention includes a laser device that can be formed from either a heterostructure or a homogeneous structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further objects and advantages of the invention will be brought out in the following portions of the specification, wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing preferred embodiments of the invention without placing limitations thereon.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> 1. Introduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a family of nanostructures which we refer to as &ldquo;nanowires&rdquo;. Nanowires in accordance with the present invention generally comprise heterostructures of at least one substantially crystalline material and one other compositionally different material where an interface or junction is formed therebetween. However, nanowire heterostructures according to the invention can also include heterostructures where the materials are the same but have different crystalline orientations. Furthermore, the surface of a nanowire according to the present invention (whether a homostructure or a heterostructure) could be functionalized to capture specific chemical or biological species. In the event that substantially crystalline materials are used to form the heterostructure, it will be appreciated that the resultant heterostructure will be substantially crystalline as well. Preferably at least one of the materials in the heterostructure is substantially monocrystalline. In this regard, we refer to a material as being substantially crystalline if the material exhibits long range ordering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A nanowire according to the present invention preferably has a diameter of less than approximately 200 nm at its maximum point, and the diameter along the longitudinal axis preferably varies by less than approximately 10% over the section exhibiting the maximum change in diameter. Additionally, nanowires according to the invention can have various cross-sectional shapes, including, but not limited, to circular, square, rectangular and hexagonal. For example, ZnO nanowires have a hexagonal cross-section, SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>nanowires have a rectangular cross-section, PbSe nanowires have a square cross-section, and Si or Ge nanowires have a circular cross-section. In each case, the term &ldquo;diameter&rdquo; is intended to refer to the effective diameter, as defined by the average of the major and minor axis of the cross-section of the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the nanowire materials of the present invention are fundamentally different from those commonly referred to as semiconductor &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; formed by using basic VLS growth techniques. It is well understood that the mechanism responsible for the growth of these &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; is limited to the creation of semiconductor wires of a diameter greater than approximately 1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The methods of the present invention describe a method of modifying VLS growth in which the catalyst size is arrested to form nanowires with diameters from approximately 1 nm to approximately 200 nm. Due to the quantum confinement effects, these structures are fundamentally different than whiskers, which are larger than the Bohr exciton radius of the bulk semiconductors from which they are formed, and therefore represent a unique composition of matter. The physical, optical, and electronic properties of these materials are fundamentally different than would be achieved if the characteristics of whiskers were simply extrapolated toward far smaller sizes. In the nanowire size range these materials represent a new form of matter, different than bulk material in ways which are unique and non-obvious. The importance of the distinction between nanowires and traditional &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; should be appreciated. Whiskers operate as small &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; semiconductor wires and thereby provide the same functionality as wires formed by standard photolithographic semiconductor processing techniques. The nanowires described within the present invention, however, display both electronic and optical properties that are fundamentally different than the bulk material from which they are formed, and are characteristically different than that of &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention include configurations where two or more substantially monocrystalline materials are spatially arranged in such a manner that quantum confinement effects are exploited in new and unique ways. This approach is expected to not only open the road to scientific discoveries, but also offer the promising prospects of dramatically changing energy conversion technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments of the invention fabrication is facilitated with the well known vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) chemical synthesis process which will be described herein. The basic (unmodified) VLS process is also described in detail in the following publications which are incorporated herein by reference: Wagner, R. S., &ldquo;VLS Mechanism of Crystal Growth&rdquo;, Whisker Technology, pp. 47-119 (1970); Wagner et al., &ldquo;Vapor-Liquid-Solid Mechanism of Single Crystal Growth&rdquo;, Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 4., No. 5, pp. 89-90 (1964); and Givargizov, E., &ldquo;Fundamental Aspects of VLS Growth&rdquo;, Journal of Crystal Growth, Vol. 31, pp. 20-30 (1975) . Using the basic (unmodified) VLS, it is possible to grow monocrystalline nanowires of a wide variety of semiconducting materials (e.g., Si, Ge, ZnO, etc.) with an average diameter greater than approximately 1 &mgr;m and a diameter distribution greater than 50% and lengths up to or exceeding many millimeters. The present invention provides methods of forming nanowires structures with a diameter less than approximately 200 nm and preferably in the range of approximately 5 nm to approximately 50 nm, with lengths in the range of approximately 100 nm to approximately 100 &mgr;m, preferably in the range between approximately 1 &mgr;m to approximately 20 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if the diameter of semiconducting nanowires is reduced to the range of approximately 5 nm to approximately 50 nm, quantum confinement of electrons and holes allows tailoring of the electronic band structure of the entire nanowire or of one or more domains within the nanowire. Such confinement can also strongly influence photon and/or phonon transport in nanowires because both the photon and/or phonon spectra and lifetimes can be significantly modified. The importance of surface energy and growth anisotropy in nanowire synthesis also affords the possibility of synthesizing phases that are stable in nanowire form but metastable in the bulk or as thin films. Hence, materials with unique phases and properties can be created in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> 2. Nanowire Heterostructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an aspect of the present invention comprises the following two nanowire heterostructures as building blocks for other heterostructures and devices: (i) a coaxial heterostructure nanowire (COHN) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; and (ii) a longitudinal heterostructure nanowire (LOHN) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, COHN <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a substantially crystalline core <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> surrounded by a sheath <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of a compositionally different material where a junction <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed therebetween. Sheath <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be substantially crystalline or amorphous, a polymer, semiconductor, oxide or the like. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, LOHN <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises at least one segment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a substantially crystalline material adjacent to at least one other segment <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a compositionally different material where a junction <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Heterostructures according to the present invention can be formed with any number of segments, both longitudinally and coaxially, and in various configurations, some of which are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a superlattice of additional segments <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby illustrating that a heterostructure is not limited to only two adjacent segments. It will be appreciated, however, that at least two of the segments should comprise compositionally different materials in order to be a heterostructure. By &ldquo;compositionally different&rdquo; we mean (i) the materials have different chemical compositions (whether intrinsic or doped) or (ii) the materials have different crystal directions (e.g., the same materials but different crystal orientation). The nanowire heterostructure could comprise compositionally different materials when viewed longitudinally, such as would be the case with alternating or periodic segments of different materials or multi-segmented nanowires where at least two of the segments comprise different materials. An example of a LOHN where adjacent segments have different compositions would be a segment of Si adjacent to a segment SiGe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrate various examples of COHNs having additional segments. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a core <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a sheath comprising first and second segments <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a core comprising first and second segments <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, respectively, surrounded by a sheath <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> having a core comprising first and second core segments <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, respectively, and a sheath comprising first and second sheath segments <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, respectively. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a COHN <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> having a core comprising a superlattice of segments <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> surrounded by a sheath <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Note that the sheath can be crystalline or amorphous, and can include materials such as polymers, semiconductors, oxides, and the like. In addition, COHNs can have multiple sheath layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, COHNs can be formed by partially coating a single-segment nanowire or a LOHN. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> having a single-segment core <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which is only partially surrounded by a sheath <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a COHN <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> having a LOHN core comprising segments <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> wherein the core is only partially surrounded by sheath <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the cores could comprise superlattices with a partial sheath. Note also that the sheath portion could be segmented as well and, further, that the segments of the sheath could be adjacent or spaced-apart. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these sheath configurations are achieved using conventional masking techniques, and that these configurations represent just a few of the possible configurations based on the nanowire structures described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that segments of heterostructures can comprise various materials, including, for example, semiconductor materials which are doped or undoped (i.e. pure intrinsic semiconductors) and arranged to form a variety of semiconductor devices with junctions such as pn, pnp, npn, pin, pip and so forth. In certain embodiments the materials can be doped in a conventional manner. For example, conventional dopants such as B, Ph, As, In and Al can be used. Both the nanowire and the dopant materials can be selected from Groups II, III, IV, V, VI, etc. and can include quaternaries and tertiaries, as well as oxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> One of the inventive aspects of the present invention is that while it is commonly believed that such nanostructures cannot be &ldquo;homogeneously doped&rdquo; (i.e. doped such that dopant molecules are dispersed in a microscopically homogeneous manner), the materials of the present invention operate as if homogeneous doping was performed, because they conduct as would be expected if dopant molecules had been homogeneously distributed throughout the material. This result is unexpected since the high temperature and small size of the nanowires would suggest that all dopant molecules would be annealed to the surface of the wires, where they would behave in the manner of trap sites rather than replicating the electronic properties of a &ldquo;homogeneously doped&rdquo; semiconductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In a number of embodiments, the present invention contemplates nanowire heterostructures comprising one or more doped semiconductors selected from a group that includes, but is not limited to, type II-VI semiconductor, type III-V semiconductor, type II-IV semiconductor, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Essentially any semiconductor material and its alloys can be used as adjacent materials in a nanowire heterostructure according to the present invention. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a nanowire heterostructure <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which is a pn junction device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a nanowire heterostructure <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which is a pnp, npn, pin, pip, etc. junction device. Many of the nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention are generally based on a semiconducting wire wherein the doping and composition are controlled in either the longitudinal or radial directions, or in both directions, to yield a wire that comprises compositionally different materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, in a heterostructure according to the present invention at least one of the segments comprises a material that is substantially crystalline, particularly at its core. It will be appreciated that oxides on a nanowire surface can be amorphous without destroying the substantially crystalline ordering of the nanowire core. In addition, the nanocrystals can include defects, substitutions of atoms, certain dislocations, and combinations thereof, without defeating substantial long-range ordering. In general, insofar as the material exhibits substantial long-range ordering (e.g. ordering over a distance of approximately 100 nm, it will be regarded as substantially crystalline and/or substantially monocrystalline. Insofar as the material exhibits long-range ordering, then the material is considered to be substantially crystalline according to the present invention. Preferably, at least the inner 20% of the material from the cross-sectional center outward is substantially monocrystalline. In the case of silicon nanowires, epitaxial growth is preferred (i.e., monocrystalline growth for silicon on a silicon wafer by precipitating silicon from a vapor). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The diameter of a nanowire according to the present invention is typically less than approximately 200 nm at the maximum point of diameter and preferably in the range from approximately 5 nm to approximately 50 nm. In addition, the variation in diameter across an ensemble of wires synthesized in the same process is relatively sharp, such that the distribution of diameters is typically less than approximately 50%, preferably less than approximately 20%, more preferably less than approximately 10%. In cases where the cross-section of the nanowire is not circular, the term &ldquo;diameter&rdquo; in this context refers to the average of the lengths of the major and minor axis of the cross-section of the nanowire, with the plane being normal to the longitudinal axis of the nanowire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, nanowires according to the present invention typically exhibit a high uniformity in diameter from end to end. More particularly, over a section of the nanowire that shows the maximum change in diameter would preferably not exceed approximately 10%, more preferably it would not exceed approximately 5%, and most preferably it would not exceed approximately 5%. The change in diameter may be considered to be given by (d<highlight><subscript>max</subscript></highlight>&minus;d<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight>)/d<highlight><subscript>min</subscript></highlight>). It should be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that the ends of the nanowire will contain a sharp change in diameter, possibly even exhibiting an infinite slope, wherein the measure described above is considered to be at a location away from the ends of the nanowires. The measurement preferably being made at a location separated from an end by at least 5%, and more preferably at least 10%, of the total length of the wire. In certain embodiments, the change in diameter is evaluated over a length of the nanowire that ranges from approximately 1%, preferably up to approximately 25%, more preferably up to approximately 75%, and most preferably up to approximately 90% of the total length of the nanowire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The junctions between the compositionally different substantially crystalline materials defining nanowire heterostructures according to the present invention typically exhibit a high degree of sharpness. For example, in accordance with the present invention, the transition zone between these materials can be made as sharp as approximately one atomic layer to the total lateral length of the nanowire (i.e. a continuously varying alloy along the length of the wire). Typically, the transition should be relatively sharp, however, the transition may span between a single atomic layer and approximately 50 nm, and more preferably between a single atomic layer and approximately 20 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of evaluating the length of a transition (transition zone) in the case of a LOHN, the beginning of the transition zone transitioning from a first material to a second material can be defined as a point along the longitudinal axis moving from the first material to the second material wherein the deviation in material composition (e.g. dopant concentration and/or base material composition) of the first material is less than approximately 20%, more preferably less than approximately 10%, more preferably less than approximately 5%, and most preferably less than approximately 1%. The end of the transition zone transitioning from the first material to the second material can be defined as the point along the longitudinal axis moving from the first material to the second material where the deviation in material composition of the nanowire at that point as compared to the composition (e.g. dopant concentration and/or base material concentration) of the second material is less than approximately 20%, more preferably less than approximately 10%, more preferably less than approximately 5%, and most preferably less than approximately 1%. In the case of a COHN, the beginning and end of the transition zone are measured as a function of composition radially from the center of the nanowire. In either case, the transition zone should represent a change from a substantially crystalline and preferably substantially monocrystalline material to a compositionally different material. It should be appreciated, however, that since heterostructures according to the present invention can comprise multiple segments either longitudinally, coaxially, or both. It should also be appreciated that it is also possible to form heterostructures in which some junctions exhibit a high degree of sharpness while others do not, as depends upon the specific application and requirements. Furthermore, not only can the composition of the materials forming adjacent segments be sharp or gradual, but by controlling the doping of materials forming segments of the heterostructure, it is possible to have sharp or gradual dopant transitions between segments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, note that the band structure of materials <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in COHNs can be so chosen that one can achieve modulation doping, whereby the dopant atoms would reside in the sheath <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the carriers would be generally confined in the core <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This will provide very high electron mobility due to reduced dopant and interface scattering that has been observed in uncoated nanowires. This is the one-dimensional (1-D) version of the two-dimensional (2-D) electron gas that is created by semiconductor 2-D heterostructures. Such a 1-D electron gas can then utilized, for example, in high-performance thermoelectric and photonic devices where electron mobility plays an important role. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Nanostructures with reduced dimensionality such as nanowires are both fundamentally interesting and technologically important. Yet, nanowire synthesis has remained an enormous challenge for material scientists because of the difficulty with one-dimensional control. Carbon nanotubes can also be used as templates to prepare nanorods of different compositions. There are also efforts using membrane templates to make metal or semiconducting nanorods. However, these nanorods are mostly polycrystalline, which partly limit their potential usefulness. In order to gain well-defined structure-property correlation for these 1D systems, it was necessary to develop general and predictive methodology for the synthesis of single crystalline nanowires with uniform size and aspect ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> 3.1 VLS Mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The nanowires and nanowire heterostructures of the present invention can be synthesized by a wide variety of methods. In preferred embodiments, however, the nanowires are synthesized utilizing a modified vapor liquid solid (VLS) procedure. This process is described in detail in the examples provided herein, which are provided by way of example and not of limitation, wherein a number of modifications of the exemplified process are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the above synthetic approaches, the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process is a very powerful method to chemically synthesize single-crystalline 1D nanomaterials. This process, which has been previously used to produce micron sized whiskers and recently nanowires with various compositions, involves dissolving the gas reactants in nanosized catalytic liquid followed by one-dimensional growth of single-crystalline nanowhiskers. The catalyst can be easily chosen based on the analysis of the equilibrium phase diagrams. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Referring to the schematic diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, an example of the growth process of an Si nanowire on an Si (111) substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated. In this example, SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>gas <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is utilized as the Si vapor source and Au nanoclusters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> as catalysts. The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is preferably carried out at approximately 600&deg; C. to approximately 800&deg; C. At this temperature, the Au nanoclusters <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> form a liquid alloy with Si and spontaneously break up into nanometer sized droplets <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of Au&mdash;Si alloy. Next, the Si species continuously deposit into Au&mdash;Si alloy droplets where growth of the Si nanowire <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is initiated upon supersaturation of the gold by the silicon. The process continues until nanowire <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> achieves the desired length. Nanowires have been successfully prepared from Si, Ge and ZnO utilizing this mechanism in a conventional chemical vapor transport/deposition (CVT/CVD) system. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies indicate that the inorganic nanowires are single crystalline with a preferred growth direction (e.g. &lsqb;111&rsqb; for Ge). The diameter of these nanowires can be precisely controlled at diameters less than approximately 200 nm. Preferably the diameters are controlled at diameters less than approximately 100 nm, more preferably less than approximately 50 nm, and most preferably less than approximately 25 nm, 15 nm, or 10 nm. By using catalyst nanoclusters (e.g. Au, Co, Ni, Fe) with a monodisperse diameter distribution and with different sizes (e.g. from approximately 1 nm to approximately 100 nm, more typically from approximately 5 nm to approximately 100 nm), such nanowires can readily be produced (e.g. having a diameter ranging from approximately 5 nm to approximately 200 nm, and most typically from approximately 10 nm to approximately 50 nm). These catalysts can be either dispersed on a Si substrate (e.g. an Si substrate or a substrate comprising other desired material or materials) or on top of a mesoporous silica film (e.g. an Si film or alternative films comprising other desired material or materials) . It was also found that the aspect ratio of the nanowires can be varied from approximately 1.5 or 2 to on the order of 1,000,000 and more typically from approximately 100 to approximately 100,000 by using different growth times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The position of the nanowires on substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be controlled through any convenient method of patterning the catalyst. Such methods include, but are not limited to various sputtering and controlled deposition techniques, various lithographic masking and/or etching techniques, along with additional methods and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, nanowire arrays can be fabricated by lithographically patterning a thin film catalyst on the substrate and heating the film until it melts into a plurality of droplets where each droplet acts as the catalyst for an individual nanowire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the substrate material is not limited to Si, or even a single material, and for example, insulators such as sapphire can be used as a substrate. Generally any material that can be made soluble or suspended in an appropriate catalyst may be utilized in the formation of a nanowire by the methods of the present invention. Such materials include, but are not limited to Group II, III, IV, V, and VI materials or alloys thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The metal catalyst can be a material other than Au as well, and also need not be limited to a single material (e.g. the use of various alloy materials is contemplated). By way of example, GaN nanowires can be fabricated on a C-sapphire substrate using an Ni catalyst and a vapor of Ga and NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. Here, preferred growth would be in the (002) direction. Furthermore, the nanowire can be doped with Mn by using a mixture of MnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and C. Similarly, a Ga(Co)N nanowire can be grown by using an Ni catalyst, C-sapphire substrate and Ga&plus;NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rarr;Co doping by Co<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&plus;C mixture. A GaN nanowire can also be grown by using a Ni catalyst, C-sapphire substrate and Ga<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&plus;C mixture. Alloyed Ga&mdash;N&mdash;Zn&mdash;O nanowires can be grown by using an Ni catalyst, C-sapphire substrate and Ga&plus;NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rarr;layer by ZnO&plus;C mixture. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> High temperature TEM was used to observe the growth of a Ge nanowire in situ. Here, small numbers of Ge particles were dispersed on TEM grids together with Au nanoclusters and served as the Ge vapor source when the sample stage was heated in the vacuum chamber. It was observed that the melting of Au clusters initiated after the Ge&mdash;Au alloy formation. This was followed by an increase of the liquid droplet size during the Ge vapor condensation process. When the droplet supersaturates with the Ge component, the Ge nanowire spits out (is ejected) from the alloy droplet and starts to grow. The real-time observation of the nanowire growth directly mirrors the mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Based on these observations, several aspects of nanowire growth control are immediately apparent: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> (1) Inorganic nanowires with different compositions (e.g. Si, Ge, GaAs, CdSe, GaN, AIN, Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, ZnO, and others) can be synthesized by using suitable metal catalysts, gas precursors and reaction temperatures. The latter can be determined by examining the binary or ternary phase diagram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> (2) Conventional dopants such as B, Ph, As, In and Al can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> (3) Materials can be selected from types III-V, II-VI, II-IV, etc. and can include quaternaries and tertiaries, as well as oxides. Essentially any semiconductor material and its alloys can be used as adjacent materials in a nanowire heterostructure according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> (4) To the first order approximation, the nanowire diameter is determined by the catalyst size. Smaller nanoclusters will yield thinner nanowires. This has also been successfully demonstrated in the GaP and Si nanowire system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Synthesis methods of the present invention share some features of surfactant-mediated epitaxial growth in that the mediating material (in the form of a molten metal nanoparticle or a monolayer, respectively) catalyzes the epitaxial growth by inhibiting the reconstruction of the semiconductor growth surface. Since there is no stable reconstruction that must be continually disassembled and reestablished, nanowire growth can occur selectively and at lower temperature than conventional epitaxial growth. The lower temperatures offer the opportunity to access new phases, to produce sharper interfaces, and to inhibit morphological evolution of the nanowire material during the growth process (e.g., Rayleigh breakup). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> 3.2 Altered Phase Equilibria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The nanowire geometry provides the opportunity to synthesize phases not stable in bulk or thin-film form. As a result of the high surface-to-volume ratio, surface energy contributes more strongly to the total free energy terms in the free energy, especially for crystalline phases with highly anisotropic surface energies. For example, the equilibrium phase boundary between zincblende (cubic) and wurtzite (hexagonal) polytypes of II-V and II-VI semiconductors will shift in pressure and temperature relative to the bulk equilibrium boundary. For example, comparing a &lt;111&gt; oriented zincblende nanowire to a &lt;0001&gt; oriented wurtzite nanowire of the same composition, a cylindrical wurtzite nanowire will more closely approximate the equilibrium (Wulff) shape, exposing low surface-energy prismatic facets. The wurtzite phase has indeed been observed as the preferred phase of GaAs in previous research on nanowire synthesis by OMCVD. In addition, epitaxial relationship between the substrates and nanowires could also be utilized to trap metastable phases in nanowire forms. This strategy has been successfully used in thin film growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> 3.3 Heteroepitaxy in Nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor heterostructures enable confinement of electrons and holes, guiding of light and selective doping, yet these interfaces must be dislocation-free if they reside in active regions of the device. The range of materials that can be grown by coherent epitaxy on a given substrate, and to a required thickness, is greatly limited by the lattice misfit. For a given lattice misfit, the equilibrium critical thickness for coherent epitaxy may be estimated with knowledge of the elastic properties of the film and the core energy and crystallography of a misfit dislocation (e.g., in-plane edge component of the burgers vector). Although coherent heteroepitaxial films can be grown well beyond the equilibrium critical thickness, the films are metastable to relaxation by dislocation mechanisms. The nanowire morphology produced by the methods of this invention provides the opportunity to markedly extend both the equilibrium and kinetic critical thicknesses (or equivalently, the lattice misfit that can be accommodated at a given thickness) due to the change in boundary conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> There are two primary effects. The first is the relaxation of the elastic boundary conditions normal to the growth direction. In the ideal thin film morphology, the strain energy stored in the coherent film per unit area increases linearly with film thickness. In a nanowire heterostructure, the &ldquo;film&rdquo; is constrained laterally only at the interface. As the nanowire &ldquo;film&rdquo; thickens, it will relax laterally so that the stored elastic strain energy saturates. In fact, some of the strain energy will also be stored on the &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; side, as this material may relax laterally as well. The result is that the equilibrium critical thickness for a given lattice mismatch will be extended relative to the thin-film value. Unlike the film case, there will be a finite range of lattice misfits that are associated with infinite critical thickness due to the saturation in stored elastic strain energy with thickness. Countering this first effect is the fact that the strain energy penalty associated with the misfit dislocation strain field is reduced due to the reduced volume of the nanowire. However, the core energy term remains and thus the first effect is expected to dominate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> 3.4 Longitudinal Heterostructure Nanowires (LOHNs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The success of semiconducting integrated circuits is largely determined by the capability of defect engineering through controlled doping. Defect engineering is expected to have even more profound effect on nanowires because not only will it contribute to doping and thereby lead to novel devices, it may also strongly influence electron scattering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Using the methods described herein, compositional profiles such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> are generated along the wire axis through successive feed-in of different dopant gas. For example, to achieve a LOHN comprising a Si pn-junction as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, species such as B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and PH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>would be sequentially used during nanowire growth. The CVD process allows accurate growth control of the compositional profile and makes it possible to fabricate junctions with sharp compositional interfaces. 1-D superlattices <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of Si/Ge and various III-V, II-VI, II-IV and tertiary and quaternary materials can also be fabricated using this approach as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Therefore, by sequentially changing the gas used in the VLS process, LOHNs can readily be synthesized. The process will, in general, allow bandgap engineering in 1-D and thereby also allow fabricating a sequence of multiple quantum dots. Quantum dots are currently grown either in solution or through island formation during thin film growth. Because the location of these quantum dots is not known apriori, it becomes very difficult to make contacts with individual quantum dots. By precisely integrating quantum dots within a single nanowire, the problems of making contacts are eliminated. One thus obtains what we refer to as a &ldquo;system on an nanowire.&rdquo; These novel 1D nanostructures offer great opportunities to explore new physics and phenomena for low dimensional systems. They can be potentially used as active nanoelectronic, nano-optical nanothermoelectric or nanoelectromechanical devices. It is also possible to synthesize nanowires of different crystal structures, such as zinc blende and wurzite CdSe and GaN nanowires. This can be achieved by using different substrates to trap certain metastable phases through the epitaxial growth relationship between the substrates and nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> 3.5 Co-Axial Heterostructure Nanowires (COHNs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> It is also possible to synthesize co-axial nanostructures such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> using the as-made nanowires as physical templates. For example, conformal and uniform carbon coating on Ge nanowires can be obtained by decomposing organic molecules on the wire surface. This approach can be readily extended to create COHNs with strong electron confinement effect. For example, GaAs nanowires fabricated using VLS could be subsequently coated with a thin layer of Al<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>As by using low temperature chemical vapor deposition process that effectively avoids crystal growth along the wire axis and promotes surface overgrowth of Al<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>Ga<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>As. Note, however, that the sheath can be crystalline or amorphous, and can include materials such as polymers, semiconductors, oxides, and the like. To form a COHN, a single-segment nanowire or a LOHN would first be formed according to any of the methods described herein. The single-segment nanowire or the LOHN, which will become the core of the COHN is then used as a template for forming the sheath. For example, the sheath can be formed by polymerization of monomers on the surface of the single-segment nanowire or the COHN. Alternatively, any physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process can be used to coat the single-segment nanowire or the LOHN. Examples of core/sheath materials, respectively, include, but are not limited to, Si and ZnO, Ge and C, Si and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, GaN and ZnO, GaAlN and GaN. Note that there is essentially an unlimited number of core/sheath material configurations. Even oxides, such as ZnO, can be used for the core material. The following is a list of core/sheath configurations where, for example, both the core and the sheath are monocrystalline: TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; M:TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(M&equals;Mn, Fe, Co, Cr, etc.); PbTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; BaTiO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; LaMnO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/SnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; and HTSC/SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(high temperature semiconductor&mdash;HTSC); GaAs/GaAlAs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Note also that this approach can be used to synthesize a nanotube. For example, a Ge nanowire core could be coated with an organic molecular material. The surface of the organic material would then be carbonized by pyrolysis in a vacuum. The Ge nanowire core would then be melted or evaporated at a temperature ranging from approximately 800&deg; C. to approximately 1000&deg; C., thereby forming a carbon nanotube. In addition, the same process may be utilized to form a &ldquo;nanocylinder&rdquo;, in which a COHN structure is formed and the core is then differentially etched away, leaving only the outer sheath (or cylinder). This cylinder may be made from any of the materials from which a sheath may be made, including but not limited to C, Si and SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SnO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, GaN and ZnO, GaAlN and GaN. It will be appreciated that structural characterization of these nanowires will rely heavily on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Both XRD and TEM will allow for determining the structure/phase of the nanowires. In addition, TEM will provide further information on the defect structures within individual wires, the local microstructure at the interface, growth direction, and overall crystallinity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 4.1.1 Modeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The role of interface roughness and localization in nanowires has been extensively studied in quantum wires defined using electron beam lithography or using electrostatic confinement with split gate method. The transition from ballistic to diffusive transport, positive and negative magneto resistance, conductance quantization and universal fluctuations have been observed at low temperatures. Nanowires fabricated using the process of the present invention provide a unique opportunity to study electron transport in a variety of 1D electronic materials. In addition, the possibility to dope the nanowires similar to CVD deposited thin film materials gives an extra degree of freedom to investigate dominant scattering mechanisms at various electron densities. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, in COHNs, modulation doping of wider bandgap material will allow spatial separation of ionized dopants <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and free carriers <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, and thus higher mobilities could be achieved. Confining free carriers to the core region inside the nanowire sheath will reduce the surface scattering effects. When electrons occupy cylindrical regions next to the heterostructure interface in coaxial nanowires, new quantized whispering gallery electronic states can also be formed. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, heterostructures along the direction of a LOHN nanowire will allow formation of quantum dot states <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. These states can significantly affect electronic properties of nanowires. One could observe coulomb blockade as well as 1D resonant tunneling features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, modeling is preferably carried out in two stages. First, simple 1D band structure models and relaxation time approximation are used to estimate electron mobility along the nanowires at higher temperatures. More elaborated models are then utilized, such as variable range hopping, to take into account the surface/interface scattering and calculate the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity. Other factors, such as modifications in phonon spectra and scattering times, electron-phonon interaction, and so forth may be studied using Monte Carlo simulations of the Boltzmann equation. Note that heterostructure nanowires can contain several confined and interface phonon modes that can scatter electrons differently from what one may find in bulk semiconductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> 4.1.2 Characterization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In order to characterize the electronic properties of bulk and heterostructure nanowires, it is important to measure the doping concentration profile along the nanowire, electron mobility, potential barrier at the hetero interfaces, etc. Conventional bulk or thin film characterization methods have to be carefully examined before applying to nanowire materials. Electrical conductivity along the nanowire is an important parameter and should be characterized over a wide range of temperatures. In addition, measurement of the magneto resistance will give more information how the surface scattering affects electron transport. Measurement of the thermoelectric properties (Seebeck coefficient) will give more information about the features of the electronic density-of-states and scattering mechanisms near the Fermi surface. Measurement of thermionic emission current can be used to determine the heterostructure barriers along the nanowire direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy (BEEM) is one of the ideal techniques to measure the &ldquo;localized&rdquo; electronic properties of nanowire structures and characterize the coaxial heterostructures. BEEM is a powerful low energy electron microscopy technique for lateral imaging and spectroscopy (with nm resolution for buried structures placed up to 30 nm below the surface). The BEEM technique has been used to study a variety of self-assembled quantum dot structures grown on GaAs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> GaSb quantum dots grown on GaAs were observed through STM and BEEM images. In the STM image, a roughly circular feature &tilde;50 nm in diameter and &tilde;5 nm tall, marked the lateral position of the buried dot. The area in the BEEM image aligned with the dot profile in STM was darker than the surrounding region, implying that the BEEM current through the dot is reduced due to electrons reflection off the potential barrier of the dot. The height of this barrier (i.e. the local band offset) can be extracted from the changes in BEEM spectra between the on and off cases. The on dot and off dot BEEM spectra of several dots were fitted by using a modified Bell-Kaiser planar tunneling model, giving a local conduction band offset for GaSb dots on GaAs of 0.08&plusmn;0.02 eV. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows the band profile and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows the characteristic BEEM spectra for GaSb/GaAs self-assembled single quantum dots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In addition to measuring properties such as the heterojunction band offset, the technique has been used to study the electronic band structure of new materials such as Ga As<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x </subscript></highlight>Nx alloys, the effect of ordering on the band structure of GaInP and resonant tunneling through InP quantum dots confined between AlInP barriers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> It is clear that BEEM can be used to characterize the electronic properties not only of the individual nanowires, but also the variation of longitudinal heterostructures of the type described herein, as illustrated in the configuration 150 of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. Confinement effects would lead to structure in the BEEM current which can be analyzed through second-derivative (SD) BEEM spectroscopy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> 4.2 Optical Properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Observing light emission from nanowires is extremely challenging because of the role of surface states and non-radiative recombination at these states. With the use of coaxial heterostructure nanowires (COHNs) electrons are confined in the center regions inside the wire. The effect of free surfaces is thus reduced. Photoluminescence spectroscopy in a wide range of temperatures can be used to study light emission from nanowires, taking advantage of superresolution techniques in order to obtain images with subwavelength spatial resolution. Additionally, scanning solid immersion lenses can be used to characterize localized light emission from individual nanowires. Fabrication and characterization of pn junctions in nanowires is one of the key building blocks for optoelectronic devices. DC and pulsed electrical and optical methods can be used to measure photocurrent, recombination lifetime and electroluminescence in nanowires. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Thermal properties of semiconductors are generally dominated by transport of acoustic phonons. The thermal conductivity due to phonons can be related to two fundamental characteristics: (i) phonon dispersion relation; and (ii) phonon lifetime. Thermal conductivity can be calculated using the relation

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> where p is the phonon polarization, v(p, &isin;) is the group velocity which is a function of the polarization and energy, &isin;&equals;h&ohgr; is the phonon energy, f<highlight><subscript>BE</subscript></highlight>(&isin;, T) is the Bose-Einstein equilibrium distribution, T is the temperature, D(p, &isin;) is the density of states, and &tgr;(r, p, &isin;) is the phonon lifetime as a function of position, polarization and energy. At room temperatures (T&equals;1.0&thgr;<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>, &thgr;<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>; Debye temperature), the thermal conductivities of most bulk semiconductors are limited by phonon Umklapp scattering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Phonon transport in nanowire heterostructures can be vastly different from that in bulk semiconductors mainly because the dispersion relation is significantly modified due to impose confinement in two directions. Second, the presence of heterostructure interfaces introduce phonon modes which exist at the interfaces. These result in many different phonon polarizations other than the two transverse and one longitudinal acoustic branches found in bulk semiconductors. These changes in the dispersion relation modifies the group velocity and the density of states of each branch. The changes in phonon temperatures come from two sources. First, the phonon-phonon interactions can change because selection rules based on energy conservation and wave-vector relations depend on the dispersion relation. Second, boundary scattering can be much stronger in nanowires (5-50 nm diameter) than in bulk semiconductors. Finally, because nanowire confinement can allow us to access new crystalline phases, the phonon dispersion relation can be drastically modified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The thermal and thermoelectric properties of nanowires according to the present invention can be measured using a microfabricated structure comprising two suspended heaters that contain e-beam lithographically fabricated wires. As a test, a multiwall carbon nanotube bundle was placed across the two heater sections so that the two heater sections were bridged. By monitoring the heat input from one heater and the temperature of both heaters, the nanotube thermal conductivity was extracted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> plots the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature of the multiwall carbon nanotube from 10&deg; K to 350&deg; K, indicating a T<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>behavior suggestive of phonon confinement in a 2-D material. The monotonic increase in thermal conductivity indicates suppression of phonon-phonon scattering and the presence of very long (e.g., &ap;1 &mgr;m) mean free paths. This approach can also be used for measuring thermal conductivities of COHNs and LOHNs according to the present invention. In addition, batch-fabricated atomic force microscope (AFM) probes were employed with temperature sensors on the tip for scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) to thermally and thermoelectrically characterize COHNs and LOHNs locally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments, nanowire characterization computations focus on three aspects: (i) calculation of phonon dispersion relations, (ii) calculations of phonon lifetimes based on dopant scattering, nanowire size and boundary scattering, and three-phonon enharmonic interactions, and (iii) phonon transport calculations. Because wave effects (phonon bandgaps) are already accounted for in the dispersion relations, phase randomizing scattering may be assumed. Under these circumstances, the Boltzmann transport equation may be solved using Monte Carlo simulations where it is simple to account for the density of states of different polarization branches in a nanowire, as well as frequency dependent group velocities and phonon lifetimes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> 4.4 Thermoelectricity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The thermopower of a semiconductor depends fundamentally on three properties: (i) the density of electronic states near the Fermi level, (ii) the electron effective mass, and (iii) carrier scattering rates. Because the electronic band structure (density of states and scattering rate) can be dramatically changed by quantum confining the electrons in a nanowire, one could engineer the band structure and the position of the Fermi level in order to tailor the thermopower. The suspended heater device described above can measure both temperature and potential difference across a nanowire. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows the thermopower measurements of multiwall carbon nanotubes in the 10&deg; K to 350&deg; K temperature range. The appearance of a positive thermopower indicates holes as the dominant carriers in these carbon nanotubes. Therefore, this device can be used to measure thermopower of nanowire heterostructures such as COHNs and LOHNs described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> 4.5 Piezoelectric Properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The wurtzite structure supports a spontaneous electric dipole moment, and thus materials with this structure are both pyroelectric and piezoelectric. These properties permit strong linear coupling between applied mechanical stress and polarization (direct piezoelectric effect), between applied electric field and strain (converse piezoelectric effect), and between a change in temperature and a change in polarization (pyroelectric effect). Wurtzite nanowires (e.g., GaAs, InAs, GaN, AlN, ZnO, etc) and nanowire heterostructures are thus potentially useful as sensors and actuators at the nanoscale. Potential applications include integrated atomic force microscopy probes, resonant mass sensors with single-molecule sensitivity, nanoscale thermal sensors, electric-field-tunable GHz filters, large displacement nanobeam actuators, and nanoscale flow sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In &lt;0001&gt; wurtzite nanowires, the spontaneous polarization is oriented along the wire axis. Thus, electric fields and metal mechanical stress applied along the wire axis will generate the largest piezoelectric response. The simplest electrode configuration utilizes contacts at the base and at the tip. Longitudinal stress applied with the tip and base contacts will be sensed by the direct piezoelectric effect. Since the wire cross-sectional area is small, large stresses can be generated with small forces. With the nanowire used as a resonant sensor, one end of the nanowire must be mechanically free, and a conductive surface in close proximity will be used to detect charge on the nanowire tip and to remove or add charge by tunneling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows an experimental setup to measure the mechanical motion of a piezoelectric or pyroelectric nanowire <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> on a conducting substrate <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> using an AFM cantilever probe <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> while simultaneously measuring the electrostatic potential across the nanowire with a voltage sensor <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> 5. Block-by-block Growth of Single-crystalline Si/SiGe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Heterojunction and superlattice formation is essential for many potential applications of semiconductor nanowires in nanoscale optoelectronics. Accordingly, we have developed a hybrid Pulsed Laser Ablation/Chemical Vapor Deposition (PLA-CVD) process for the synthesis of semiconductor nanowires with longitudinal ordered heterostructures. The laser ablation process generates a programmable pulsed vapor source, which enables the nanowire growth in a block-by-block fashion with well-defined compositional profile along the wire axis. Single crystalline nanowires with longitudinal Si/SiGe superlattice structure have been successfully synthesized. This unique class of heterostructured one-dimensional nanostructures holds great potential in applications such as light emitting devices and thermoelectrics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The success of semiconductor integrated circuits has been largely dependent upon the capability of heterostructure formation through carefully controlled doping and interfacing. In fact, 2-dimensional (2D) semiconductor interface is ubiquitous in optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diode, laser diodes, quantum cascade laser and transistors. Heterostructure formation in 1-dimensional (1D) nanostructures (nanowires) is equally important for their potential applications as efficient light emitting sources and better thermoelectrics. While there are a number of well-developed techniques (e. g. molecular beam epitaxy) for the fabrication of thin film heterostructures and superlattices, a general synthetic scheme for heterojunction and superlattice formation in 1D nanostructures with well-defined coherent interfaces is currently still lacking. Here, a hybrid Pulsed Laser Ablation/Chemical Vapor Deposition (PLA-CVD) process is described for the synthesis of semiconductor nanowires with periodic longitudinal heterostructures. Monocrystalline nanowires with Si/SiGe superlattice structure were obtained and thoroughly characterized using electron microscopy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Referring <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a nanowire growth apparatus <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. Growth apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> comprises a furnace <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> having a quartz reaction tube <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. A (111) Si wafer <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> coated with a thin layer of Au was put inside the quartz reaction tube <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> as substrate. A gas mixture of SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was continuously introduced into the reaction tube <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> through an inlet <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. A computer programmed laser pulse <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> was focused on a pure Ge target <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. Residue gas was exhausted through an outlet <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> together, nanowire growth using Au as a metal solvent at high temperature as previously described and illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. This process starts with the dissolution of gaseous reactants in nanosized liquid droplets of the metal solvent, followed by nucleation and growth of single crystalline wires. The concept of heterostructured nanowires requires accurate compositional profile and interface control at nanometer or even atomic level while maintaining a highly crystalline and coherent interface along the wire axis. Based on our fundamental mechanistic understanding of VLS nanowire growth, this level of control is made possible here through successive feed-in of different vapor sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the size and size-distribution of the nanowire heterostructures can be controlled by using preformed and size controlled nanocrystal catalysts to form the nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Referring to the process flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, in the example illustrated Si/SiGe superlattice nanowires were synthesized by generating a Ge vapor in pulsed form through the pulsed ablation of the pure Ge target <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> with a frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser (wavelength 532 nm, 6 Hz, power density 10 J/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>per pulse). The flow rate of the H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was approximately 100 sccm, the ratio of SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>was approximately 0.02, and the system pressure was atmospheric pressure. The reaction temperature typically ranged from approximately 850&deg; C. to approximately 950&deg; C. At this temperature, the Au thin film <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> forms a liquid alloy with Si and spontaneously breaks up into nanometer sized droplets of Au&mdash;Si alloy <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. Next, the Si species continuously deposit into Au&mdash;Si alloy droplets where growth of the Si nanowire <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is initiated upon supersaturation. When the laser is turned off, only Si species deposit into the alloy droplet and a pure Si block is grown. However, if the laser is turned on during the growth process, Ge vapor will be generated and both Ge and Si species will be deposited into the alloy droplets. When the laser is turned on, SiGe alloy <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> then precipitates out from the solid/liquid interface. By periodically turning the laser on and off (this sequence can be easily programmed), an Si/SiGe superlattice <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is formed on every individual nanowire in a block-by-block fashion. The entire growth process resembles the living polymerization synthesis of block copolymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that various other nanowire structures can be grown using different gases and targets. For example, PbSe can be grown by laser ablation of a PbSe/Au target in Ar gas. Furthermore, growth of a nanowire superlattice according to the present invention is not limited to the foregoing synthetic process. One alternative approach would be to use multiple target materials and steer the laser with a computer for selection of target materials. Additionally, essentially any physical or chemical vapor deposition process that uses vapor supplies could be used, including, but not limited to, PLD, CVD, and MBE. For example, the vapor supplies could be configured with computer controlled valves to pulse the flow of the desired gas. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 5 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> A nanowire array <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as depicted schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> was synthesized using the process described in Example 4 and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the synthesized nanowire array was obtained. In the example shown, an Au film having a thickness on the Si (111) substrate <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of 20 nm was lithographically pattered into four sites. Each film site melted into four droplets which acted as the catalyst for a corresponding nanowire. During the growth process, the laser was periodically turned on for 5 seconds and off for 25 seconds, and the cycle was repeated for 15 min. As previously shown, Si nanowires grow preferably along &lsqb;111&rsqb; direction, which results in the oriented epitaxial nanowire array growth on the Si (111) substrate. The alloy droplets solidify and appear as a bright spot on the tip <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> of every nanowire <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Close examination of the nanowires showed the tips as having a flower-like shape which is formed during the solidification of the liquid alloy droplet. The diameters of these nanowires ranged from approximately 50 nm to approximately 300 nm. Using a Philip CM200 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 KeV, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of two nanowires in bright-field mode showed dark stripes appearing periodically along the wire axes, which originated from the periodic deposition of SiGe alloy and Si segments. The electron scattering cross section of Ge atom is larger than that of Si. Consequently, the SiGe alloy block appears darker than the pure Si block. The chemical composition of the darker area was examined using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) which showed a strong Si peak and apparent Ge doping (&tilde;12 weight % Ge) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. The periodic modulation of Ge doping was further confirmed by scanning a focused electron beam along the nanowire growth axis and tracking the change of X-ray signal from Si and Ge atoms in the wires as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. Both Si and Ge X-ray signals showed periodic modulation and intensities that were anti-correlated; in other words, wherever the X-ray signal from Ge showed a maximum, the signal from Si showed a minimum, which confirms the formation of Si/SiGe superlattice along the wire axis. We noted that the abruptness of the Si/SiGe interface in these nanowires is not ideal at this stage. It is believed that this could be improved by incorporating more precise and faster vapor dosing/switching schemes such as molecular beam process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> It must be emphasized that the elastic boundary conditions of heteroepitaxial growth offer the possibility to create dislocation-free interfaces in the superlattice nanowires that are not stable in the conventional 2D configuration achieved by epitaxial film growth on planar substrates. Although coherent heteroepitaxial films can be grown well beyond the equilibrium critical thickness, the films are metastable to relaxation by dislocation mechanisms. The VLS nanowire morphology provides an opportunity to markedly extend both the equilibrium and kinetic critical thicknesses&mdash;or equivalently, the lattice misfit that can be accommodated at a given thickness&mdash;due to the change in boundary conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The highly crystalline nature of our superlattice nanowires was characterized by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). An SAED pattern was recorded perpendicular to a nanowire long axis. The pattern was then indexed as the diffraction along the &lsqb;110&rsqb; zone axis of crystalline Si and suggested the nanowire growth does occur along &lsqb;111&rsqb; direction. This was further confirmed in the HRTEM image which clearly showed the (111) atomic planes (separation 0.314 nm) perpendicular to the nanowire axis. While the interface contrast was readily seen in the STEM images, we were not able to resolve the interface in HRTEM mode due to low doping percentage in SiGe blocks. These HRTEM images, however, clearly demonstrated the high crystallinity of the Si/SiGe superlattice nanowires. Extensive HRTEM imaging indicated that the mono-crystallinity of the Si/SiGe superlattice nanowire is maintained along the entire wire length with few linear or planar defects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Taken together, the structural and chemical composition data showed that nanowires prepared by the PLA-CVD method according to the present invention are highly crystalline with Si/SiGe superlattice structure along the nanowire axis. The diameters of the nanowires, the concentration of Ge and the period of chemical modulation can be readily controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions. The nanowire diameter is influenced by the thickness of Au layer on substrate. For example, with 20 nm thick Au thin films, the average diameter of nanowires is around 100 nm. If the thickness of Au is reduced to 1 nm, the average diameter can be reduced to 20 nm. The diameter is also affected by the reaction temperature, wherein lower temperatures result in thinner nanowires. The concentration of Ge in the superlattice is controlled by the ratio of Ge atoms and Si atoms deposited into the alloy droplets. Increasing the laser intensity or decreasing the flow rate of SiCl<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>can increase the concentration of Ge. In addition, the superlattice period (L) is the product of growth rate (V) and laser on-and-off period (T): L&equals;V<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>T. Therefore, by reducing the growth rate or the laser on-and-off period, we are able to reduce the superlattice period. Similarly, the ratio of different compositional blocks can be readily adjusted by varying the laser on/off ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Importantly, by putting these &ldquo;labels&rdquo; along the wire growth axis, the PLA-CVD process provides a quantitative way to measure the growth rate of nanowires (V&equals;L/T) and its correlation with growth supersaturation. While the laser on-and-off period T is preset, knowing the superlattice period L, the growth rate V can be accurately calculated. We found that the growth rate is diameter-dependent under the same reaction conditions. The smaller the nanowire diameter, the slower is the growth rate as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> which shows the correlation between growth rate and diameter observed in our experiment. The trend can be qualitatively explained by the Gibbs-Thomson effect, such as increasing Si vapor pressure and thereby decreasing supersaturation as the nanowire diameter becomes smaller. The decrease of supersaturation as a function of nanowire diameter (d) is given as

It will enable the creation of various functional devices (e. g. p-n junction, coupled quantum dot structure and heterostructured bipolar transistor) on single nanowires. These nanowires could be used as important building blocks for constructing nanoscale electronic circuit and light emitting devices. As an example, superlattice nanowires with reduced phonon transport and high electron mobility are believed to be better thermoelectrics. </paragraph>

The design of these devices flows directly from the fundamental scientific understanding of the effect of 1-D confinement on various physical properties. Although such scientific understanding can rely on single nanowire studies, it will be appreciated that devices will require multiple nanowires for integration into systems. Therefore, arrays of nanowires would typically be employed. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 6 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> For purposes of discussion we will focus on the three devices stated above; however, they are by no means the only devices possible using nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> 6.1 Thermoelectric Refrigeration and Power Generation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Solid-state refrigeration and power generation can be achieved using the Peltier effect, whereby a current flow across thermoelectric junctions produces can produce cooling (or heating). Conversely, a temperature difference across a thermoelectric material generates a current flow across a potential drop, and thereby electrical power. Compared to current vapor-compression refrigerators and gas-based engines, such solid-state devices are extremely promising because: (i) they do not contain any moving parts; (ii) they are environmentally benign; and (iii) allow for miniaturization. The reason they are not currently widely used is because their performance (efficiency for engines and coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigerators) is much inferior to gas/vapor based systems. If, however, the performance could be improved to be comparable or better than the vapor based systems, one could envision a drastic change in how we utilize or convert energy. This provides a strong and compelling reason to develop thermoelectric devices based on nanowires. As discussed below, this can only be achieved using nanowires according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The materials used for solid-state thermoelectric refrigerators and power generators are characterized by a figure of merit, ZT&equals;S<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&sgr;T/k, where S is the thermopower, k is the thermal conductivity, is is the electrical conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature. Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and its alloys are currently the most widely used materials and have a ZT&equals;1. It can be theoretically shown that if ZT&equals;3, the performance of thermoelectric refrigerators and engines can be comparable to those of vapor compression ones. In fact, if thermoelectric materials are nanostructured, quantum confinement of electrons and phonons can drastically increase their ZT, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>. 1-D nanowires in particular could reach ZT&ap;2 to 5 if the wire diameter lies in the range of 5 nm to 10 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> 6.1.1 Nanowire Design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Because high electron mobility provides high ZT, it is preferably to use COHNs since they will have much reduced dopant and interface scattering. The thermopower of COHNs can be tailored through bandgap engineering. Because thermal conductivity of materials is generally inversely proportional to the atomic mass (&zgr;), a high-&zgr; material would be the material of choice. It is for this reason that Bi or Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te3 nanowires are good candidates for thermoelectric applications. The thermal conductivity can be further reduced by decreasing the nanowire diameter since boundary scattering is expected to be dominant for nanowire diameters less than 20 nm at room temperatures. In addition to Bi2Te3, other materials can be used, such as SiGe or InGaAs where alloy scattering can reduce phonon transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> 6.1.2 Device Design </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Because nanowires are fragile, they should be embedded in a matrix to provide mechanical strength. For example, arrays of Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or SiGe COHN nanowires would be embedded in a polymer or dielectric material as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> to form a thermoelectric device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The thermoelectric device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> comprises upper and lower electrically insulating substrates <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, respectively, an n-doped nanowire array <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> that is separately grown on a substrate <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and wherein the nanowires <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are embedded in a polymer matrix <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and a p-doped nanowire array <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> that is separately grown on a substrate <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and wherein the nanowires <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> are embedded in a polymer matrix <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The wafers of n- and p-doped thermoelectric nanowire arrays are the brought together and bonded to with a series electrical connection and a parallel thermal connection to make a thermoelectric cooler or power generators. These connections are achieved by forming and connecting metal contact pads <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> as shown. The nanowire arrays can be easily embedded in a polymer matrix by flowing a polymer solution after the nanowires are fabricated, and then curing it using heat or UV radiation. To make the upper contacts <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (i.e., at the tips of the nanowires), the polymer will be preferentially etched down till the nanowires are exposed, after which metal contact pads are deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The design parameters for such a composite are: (a) surface density of nanowires; and (b) thickness of the device. The idea is to exploit the ultra-low thermal conductivity of polymers (k&ap;0.1 W/m-K) and the high power factors (S<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>&sgr;</subscript></highlight>) of the nanowires in order to achieve high ZT. Device performance can be characterized by measuring (a) effective electrical conductivity of the device; (b) effective thermal conductivity of the device; (c) effective Seebeck coefficient; (d) temperature difference across the device in response to a current flow; and (e) electrical power in response to a temperature difference or heat flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> 6.2 Light-Emitting Devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Nanowire composite materials have two distinct properties that can be used for light emitting device applications. On one hand, the low dimensional confinement of electrons and quantization of energy levels can be used for tuning of absorption and emission wavelength. The 1D nature of crystal growth along the nanowire could permit higher flexibility in the lattice mismatch between different materials and thus wider change in absorption and emission spectra. On the other hand, Si and II-V semiconductors have an index of refraction (3-4) that is much higher than air or silica fiber (1-1.5). This creates a mode size mismatch that is one of the main difficulties to couple light between fibers and semiconductor devices. This also limits the external quantum efficiency of light emitting diodes, since most of the emitted photons are reabsorbed in the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Based on the scientific understanding of the electronic band structure of various III-V and II-VI nanowires, nanowires can be designed for efficient absorption and emission of photons. For example, referring <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31, a</cross-reference> nanowire-polymer composite array <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can be made by integrating a plurality of semiconductor nanowires <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> into a polymer matrix <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> as previously described, thus producing an optically active material with a much lower effective index. The change in polymer refractive index with temperature is typically an order of magnitude higher than conventional semiconductors. This large thermo-optic coefficient can be combined with electronic-electronic properties of semiconductor nanowires to produce novel energy conversion devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Preferably, nanowires with the highest radiative efficiencies are integrated inside the polymer matrix in order to fabricate and characterize light emission devices. In addition, by using a mixture of nanowires made from different materials, one can achieve wider emission spectra and white light behavior. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>, an electron ejection light emitting diode/laser diode <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is shown schematically as comprising a nanowire <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> having pn junction <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> formed from growth of an n-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and a p-type semiconductor <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. A positive electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and negative electrode <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> are attached to the n- and p-type materials, respectively. Application of a potential across the electrodes will cause light emission by electron ejection as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>. This structure can be formed using, for example, ZnO, Si/Ge, and GaN with appropriate dopants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>, using longitudinal heterostructure nanowires (LOHNs) <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, one can make single quantum dot LEDs and study the effect of quantum dot size and material on the emission spectrum. The unique geometry of the quantum wire allows delivery of electrons and holes directly to the dots <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> and thus avoids the paths where electrons and holes would recombine in other places. Quantum dots can be formed using, for example, Si/Ge, PbSe/PbTe, and Bi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>/Sb<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Te<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. One could even put the composite nanowire-polymer medium inside a vertical cavity distributed dielectric mirror to provide for optical feedback and study the stimulated emission and laser action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Additionally, sophisticated T-shaped, V-grooved and Ridge quantum wire lasers and also quantum dot lasers have can be fabricated and characterized. These devices have unique properties due to 1D and 0D nature of electronic density of states. In particular, the increase in the differential gain will improve the high speed modulation characteristics. Size variation is also used to change electronic energy states and the emission spectrum. We expect that light emission in COHNs and LOHNs will create a new class of energy conversion devices where opto-electronic properties can be tailored beyond what can be achieved with current methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> 6.3 Nanowire Device Flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> As can be seen, therefore, nanowires according to the present invention can be used for fabricating a variety of devices in addition to those described above, including, but not limited to: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> (a) High electron mobility nanowires (using COHNs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> (b) High electron mobility nanowire field-effect transistors (using COHNs and applying external bias to deplete/enhance a channel). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> (e) Nanowire based single electron transistors (using LOHNs and embedded quantum dots and possible combination with COHNs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> (f) Nanowire based infrared detectors (using COHNs and quantized whispering gallery electron modes). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> (g) Nanowire magnetic sensors (using COHNs and the quantized whispering gallery electron modes which are affected under a magnetic field). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> (h) Polymer-nanowire composite light emitting devices (high external quantum efficiency, broad spectrum, good coupling with fiber). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> (i) Polymer-nanowire composite optical modulators (can make very high speed traveling wave modulators because the speed of electrical and optical signals could be matched). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> (j) Polymer-nanowire composite optical detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> (k) Polymer-nanowire composite waveguides and couplers (by growing nanowires with directional channels between the nanowires). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> (l) Polymer-nanowire composite optical switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> (m) Polymer-nanowire composite lasers (edge emitting, distributed feedback or vertical cavity structures). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that LOHNs can be used to fabricate multi-terminal devices (i.e., N&gt;2) such as pnp devices. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> shows an example of a 3-terminal pnp LOHN <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> fabricated with a p-type material <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>, n-type material <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>, and p-type material <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> and having terminals T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and T<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> illustrates another example of a 3-terminal LOHN <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> Nanoelectromechanical Devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Nanowire pyroelectric and piezoelectric devices have, in principal, the following inherent features that distinguish them from film or bulk devices: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> (a) High quality factors: The lack of extended defects should enable high mechanical quality factors in nanowire resonators. The low defect density also suggests low loss tangents and thus a high electromechanical coupling figure-of-merit (proportional to (tan &dgr;)<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> (b) High surface-to-volume ratio: The low mass per unit length, combined with the high ratio of adsorption sites to the nanowire volume will permit resonant detection of mass increments at sensitivities approaching the single molecule level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> (c) Variable length without change in materials quality: Nanowire longitudinal resonators can be made at various lengths from submicron to tens or hundreds of microns, thus allowing the fabrication of sensors or actuators with a wide range of fundamental resonant frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> (d) Nanoscale Diameter: The small diameter permits the use of piezoelectric and pyroelectric nanowires as direct probes of forces at the atomic and molecular scale, and temperature at the nanoscale. Furthermore, &ldquo;nanobeam&rdquo; unimorph benders with longitudinal electrodes and elastic layers fabricated by shadow evaporation will be capable of very large deflections due to length: thickness aspect ratios approaching 1000:1 and the large transverse electric fields possible with moderate voltages (e.g., 100 MV/m for 1 V applied across a 10 nm thick nanobeam). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>, examples of nanowire device configurations for electromechanical transducers are illustrated. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> illustrate a longitudinal configuration, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference> illustrate a transverse configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>, in &lt;0001&gt; wurtzite, the spontaneous polarization is longitudinal, i.e., oriented along the wire axis. Thus, electric fields and mechanical stress applied along the wire axis will generate the largest piezoelectric response. In the longitudinal configuration <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the simplest electrode configuration utilizes contacts (electrodes) <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> at the base and at the tip, respectively. Longitudinal stress applied with the tip and base contacts will be sensed by the direct piezoelectric effect. Since the wire cross-sectional area is small, large stresses can be generated with small forces. For example, a uniaxial tensile force of 100 nN corresponds to a uniaxial stress of 100 MPa for a wire with a cross-sectional area of (10 nm)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. A piezoelectric coefficient of 5 nC/N will thus generate a change of polarization of 0.5 C/m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, a value that is certainly detectable. With the nanowire used as a resonant sensor, one end of the nanowire must be mechanically free, and a conductive surface in close proximity will be used to detect charge on the nanowire tip and to remove or add charge by tunneling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39, a</cross-reference> completely distinct sensing and actuation capability can be expected from wurtzite nanowires in &lt;hki<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>&gt; orientation, that is, with the spontaneous polarization perpendicular to the wire growth direction. Such nanowires can be grown by choosing the appropriate surface orientation of the single-crystal substrate, e.g. sapphire with substrate with (0001) or (hki<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>) orientation. In this transverse configuration <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, electrodes may be placed at the wire ends, thus activating the piezoelectric shear mode, d<highlight><subscript>15</subscript></highlight>, or along the wire length, employing d<highlight><subscript>31</subscript></highlight>. In the d<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>mode shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> where electrodes <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are placed along the wire length, it is possible to exploit the expected large electric breakdown strength (&gt;300 MV/m) and high fracture strength of defect-free AIN nanowires to fabricate both high-displacement nanobeam unimorph benders and force sensors. Presuming that a suitable elastic layer is shadow deposited on one side of the nanowire, opposite an electrode stripe, the tip displacement, &dgr;, of the nanowire will be on the order of d<highlight><subscript>31</subscript></highlight>L<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>V/t<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. For transverse voltage of 1V, thickness of 10 nm, length of 5 &mgr;m and d<highlight><subscript>31 </subscript></highlight>of 3 pm/V, the tip displacement is expected to be about 0.75 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The transverse configuration represents synthesis and processing challenges beyond those expected for the longitudinal configuration. For example, the nanowire must be nucleated in the transverse orientation, which will likely require nucleation on a crystalline wurtzite substrate or seed. Once nucleated, the surface energy anisotropy is expected to yield nanowires of rectangular cross section, ideal for shadow deposition. Based on the substantial literature on lateral growth experiments with GaN, it is likely that the growth rate of transverse nanowires will greatly exceed that of longitudinal wurtzite nanowires. Once synthesized, nanobeam unimorph benders may be fabricated by shadow deposition of metallic layers&mdash;one thin compliant metallization to serve as an electrode (e.g., Cr/Au), and a second stiffer layer on the opposite side (e.g., Ti/Pt) to serve both as an electrode, and as an elastic layer to optimize the position of the neutral axis for bending-mode actuation. Alternatively, it is possible to make use of the substantially different surface properties of the opposing basal faces to selectively deposit metals by solution processing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Development of short-wavelength semiconductor lasers is of great current interest. This has culminated in the realization of room-temperature green-blue diode laser structures with ZnSe and In<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>G<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>N as the active layers. ZnO is another wide band-gap (3.37 eV) compound semiconductor that is suitable for blue optoelectronic applications. In fact, ultraviolet lasing action has been reported in disordered ZnO particles and thin films. For wide band-gap semiconductor materials, a high carrier concentration is usually required in order to provide an optical gain that is high enough for lasing action in an electron-hole plasma (EHP) process. Such EHP mechanism, which is common for conventional laser diode operation, typically requires high lasing thresholds. As an alternative to EHP, excitonic recombination in semiconductors can facilitate low-threshold stimulated emission because of its bosonic nature. To achieve efficient excitonic laser action at room temperature, exciton binding energy (E<highlight><superscript>b</superscript></highlight>ex) has to be much larger than the thermal energy at room temperature (26 meV). In this regard, ZnO is a good candidate since its E<highlight><superscript>b</superscript></highlight>ex is approximately 60 meV, which is significantly larger than that of ZnSe (22 meV) and GaN (25 meV). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> To further lower the threshold, low-dimensional compound semiconductor nanostructures have been fabricated, in which quantum size effects yield a substantial density of states at the band edges and enhance radiative recombination due to carrier confinement. The use of semiconductor quantum well structures as low-threshold optical gain media represents a significant advancement in semiconductor laser technology. Stimulated emission and optical gain have also been demonstrated recently in Si and CdSe nanoclusters and their ensembles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, we have demonstrated the first excitonic lasing action in ZnO nanowires with a threshold of 40 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>under optical excitation. The chemical flexibility as well as one-dimensionality of the nanowires makes them ideal miniaturized laser light sources. These short-wavelength nanolasers could have myriad applications including optical computing, information storage, and nano-analysis. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 7 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> ZnO nanowires were synthesized using a vapor phase transport process via catalyzed epitaxial crystal growth on sapphire (110) substrates. Patterned Au thin film was used as the catalyst for nanowire growth. For the nanowire growth, clean (110) sapphire substrates were coated with 10-35 Angstrom thick gold with or without using TEM grids as shadow masks (micro contact printing of thiols on Au followed by selective etching has also been used to create the Au pattern). An equal amount of ZnO powder and graphite powder were ground and transferred to an alumina boat. The Au-coated sapphire substrates were typically placed 0.5-2.5 cm from the center of the boat. The starting materials and the substrates were then heated up to 880&deg; C. to 905&deg; C. in an argon flow. Zn vapor was generated by carbothermal reduction of ZnO and transported to the substrates where ZnO nanowires grew. The growth generally took place within 2-10 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The nanowires were epitaxially grown on the substrate and formed highly oriented arrays. Selective nanowire growth can be readily achieved when patterned Au thin film was used. ZnO nanowires grew only in the Au coated area with an excellent selectivity due to the catalytic nature of Au thin layer. The area of these nanowire arrays can be readily extended to cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Generally, the diameters of these wires are in the range of 20 nm to 150 nm while majority of them have diameters of 70 nm to 100 nm. The diameter dispersion is due to the inhomogeneous sizes of the Au nanocluster catalysts when the substrate is annealed during the growth process. The lengths of these nanowires can be varied between 2 &mgr;m and 10 &mgr;m by adjusting the growth time. This capability of patterned nanowire growth allows us to fabricate nanoscale light emitters on the substrate in a controllable fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> We observed that nearly all the nanowires grew vertically from the substrates. This is due to the fact that a good epitaxial interface exists between the (0001) plane of the ZnO nanowire and (110) plane of the substrate. The ideal a plane (110) of sapphire is two-fold symmetric while the ZnO c-plane is six-fold symmetric. They are essentially incommensurate with the exception that the ZnO&apos;s a-axis and the sapphire&apos;s c-axis are related almost exactly by a factor of 4 (mismatch less than 0.08% at room temperature). Such coincidental match up along the sapphire &lsqb;0001&rsqb; direction, along with a strong tendency of ZnO to grow in the c-orientation as well as the incoherence of interfaces in directions other than sapphire &lsqb;0001&rsqb;, leads to the unique vertical epitaxial growth configuration. The anisotropy of the sapphire&apos;s a plane is critical for growing high quality c-oriented ZnO nanowire arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> SEM images of the nanowire array were obtained. Hexagon end planes of the nanowires could be clearly identified. This is a strong evidence that these nanowires grow along the &lt;0001&gt; direction and are indeed well-faceted both at the end and side surfaces. The well-faceted nature of these nanowires will have important implications when they are used as effective laser media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Additional structural characterization of the ZnO nanowires was carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A high resolution TEM image of a single-crystalline ZnO nanowire was obtained. A spacing of 2.56&plusmn;0.05 Angstroms between adjacent lattice planes corresponded to the distance between two (0002) crystal planes, further indicating that &lt;0001&gt; is the preferred growth direction for the ZnO nanowires. Significantly, this &lt;0001&gt; preferential nanowire growth on the sapphire substrate is also reflected in the X-ray diffraction pattern shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> that was taken on a Siemens Z5000. Only (0001) peaks were observed, indicating excellent overall c-axis alignment of these nanowire arrays over a large substrate area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Photoluminescence spectra of nanowires were measured using a He-Cd laser (325 nm) as an excitation source. Strong near-band gap edge emission at &tilde;377 nm has been observed. In order to explore the possible stimulated emission from these oriented nanowires, the power dependent emission was examined. The samples were optically pumped by the fourth harmonic of Nd: YAG laser (266 nm, 3 ns pulse width) at room temperature. The pump beam was focused on the nanowires at an incidence angle of 10 degrees to the symmetric axis of the nanowire. Light emission was collected in the direction normal to the end surface plane (along the symmetric axis) of the nanowires. Stimulated emission from the nanowires was collected in the direction along nanowire&apos;s end-plane normal (the symmetric axis) using a monochromator (ISA) combined with a Peltier-cooled CCD (EG&amp;G). All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Significantly, in the absence of any fabricated mirrors, we observed lasing action in these ZnO nanowires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> shows the evolution of the emission spectra as pump power was increased. At low excitation intensity (below the lasing threshold), the spectrum consists of a single broad spontaneous emission peak (curve a) with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of approximately 17 nm. This spontaneous emission was 140 meV below the band gap (3.37 eV) and is generally ascribed to the recombination of excitons through exciton-exciton collision process where one of the exciton radiatively recombines to generate a photon. As the pump power increased, the emission peak narrows due to the preferential amplification of frequencies close to the maximum of the gain spectrum. When the excitation intensity exceeded the lasing threshold (&tilde;40 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), sharp peaks emerge in the emission spectra (curve b and inset). The pump power for these spectra were 20, 100, and 150 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, respectively. The line widths of these peaks are less than 0.3 nm, which are more than 50 times smaller than the line width of the spontaneous emission peak below the threshold. Above the threshold, the integrated emission intensity increases rapidly with the pump power, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</cross-reference>. The narrow line width and the rapid increase of emission intensity indicate that stimulated emission takes place in these nanowires. The observed single or multiple sharp peaks (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>, curve b and inset) represent different lasing modes at wavelengths between 370 and 400 nm. It was observed that the lasing threshold is quite low compared with previously reported values for random lasing (&tilde;300 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) in disordered particles or thin films. Significantly, these short-wavelength nanowire nanolasers operate at room temperature and the areal density of these nanolasers readily reaches 1.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The fact that we observed lasing action in these nanowire arrays without any fabricated mirror prompts us to consider these single-crystalline, well-facetted nanowires act as natural resonance cavities to amplify stimulated emission. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a nanolaser <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> fabricated using a multi-faceted (in this example, hexagonal) ZnO nanowire <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> grown on a sapphire substrate <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. Note that nanowire <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is not a heterostructure but a homostructure in this application, however, it should be appreciated that the present invention is capable of heterostructure lasing as well as homostructure lasing. The nanowire acts as a resonant cavity with two naturally faceted hexagonal end faces <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> acting as reflecting mirrors. It is possible that the giant oscillator strength effect, that can occur in high quality nanowire crystals with dimensions larger than the exciton Bohr radius, but smaller than the optical wavelength, enables the excitonic stimulated emission in these nanowire arrays. For II-VI semiconductors, a cleaved edge of the specimen is usually used as a mirror. For our nanowires, one end is the epitaxial interface <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> between the sapphire substrate <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and ZnO while the other end is the sharp (0001) plane <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> of the ZnO nanocrystals. Both can serve as good laser cavity mirrors considering the refractive indexes for sapphire, ZnO and air are 1.8, 2.45 and 1.0, respectively. Note this is an important characteristic of this nanowire; namely, that it can be abutted against a waveguide very easily. This natural cavity/waveguide formation in nanowires suggests a simple chemical approach to form a nanowire laser cavity without cleavage and etching. In fact, when multiple lasing modes were observed for these nanowires (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> inset), the observed mode spacing is about 5 nm for &tilde;5 &mgr;m long wires, which agrees quantitatively well with the calculated spacing between adjacent resonance frequencies v<highlight><subscript>F</subscript></highlight>&equals;c/2nl, where v<highlight><subscript>F </subscript></highlight>is emission mode spacing, c the light speed, n the refractive index and l the resonance cavity length. Note also that an alternative manner in which a waveguide could be formed would be to coat the nanowire with a layer of polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> A laser according to the present invention can have nanowires supported in a solid polymer or glassy matrix, in solution, or extending off of the surface of a substrate. For wires attached to a substrate, the wires can either be disordered, or arranged so that they all point in the same direction. That direction can be normal to the substrate surface, or can be selected to be any other angle off of the substrate. In addition, even nanowires in a matrix material can be aligned so that they form an ordered structure. Note that the present invention includes lasers with the above-described nanowire-composite orientations, as well as non-laser heterostructures in the same configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> The decay of the luminescence from the ZnO nanowires was studied using a frequency-tripled mode-locked Ti: sapphire laser for pulsed excitation (200 fs pulse length) and a streak camera with ps-resolution for detection. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44, a</cross-reference> good fit (straight line) to the experimental data (dotted line) recorded at room temperature was obtained with a biexponential decay model assuming a fast and a slow process with time constants of about 70 ps and 350 ps, respectively. The time-resolved spectrum was recorded at excitation power of 6.39 mW. Therefore, these lifetime measurements show that the radiative recombination of the excitons is a superposition of a fast and a slow process. The luminescence lifetime is mainly determined by the concentration of defects, which trap the electrons and/or holes and eventually cause their nonradiative recombination. Although the exact origin of the luminescence decay remains unclear at this stage, the very long lifetime measured for these wires demonstrates the high crystal quality achieved with the nanowire growth process. Meantime, it also accounts in part for the low laser threshold reported here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In summary, we have demonstrated room-temperature ultraviolet lasing in well-oriented vertical ZnO nanowire arrays with a lasing threshold of 40 kW/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The areal density of these nanolasers on substrate can readily reach 1.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>&minus;2</superscript></highlight>. We anticipate that the lasing wavelength can be tuned into blue region by making alloy nanowires of ZnO/CdO. In addition, by creating pn junctions in these individual nanowires, one should be able to test the possibility of mating electron ejection blue lasers from individual nanowires. Such miniaturized nanowire nano-lasers will find applications in nano-photonics and microanalysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing it will be appreciated that nanowires according to the present invention can be used as optical cavities. Another way to create an optical cavity would be to create dielectrics on the ends of the wires. Additionally, some portions of the nanowire could have one energy transfer event and others have a different energy transfer event such as in a distributed feedback laser. It will also be appreciated that by capping off the ends of the optical cavity, either a laser or a light amplifier can be realized. Additionally, the cavity can be a part of the nanowire itself as previously described, the cavity could be external to the nanowire. In essence, a laser or light amplifier can be formed from a nanowire, a pumping source, and a cavity, wherein the cavity is part of the nanowire or separate from the nanowire. Furthermore, by using conventional stimulated emission techniques, a cavity is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> It will also be appreciated that nanowires according to the present invention could be employed as a functional component of a quantum dot laser such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,957 incorporated herein by reference, wherein the quantum dots would be integrated into the nanowire as described herein and the pumping source would be configured for exciting a population inversion in the quantum dots. Note, however, that a nanowire itself can be pumped for lasing where the pumping promotes a population inversion in the nanowire. The nanowire can be embedded in a polymer matrix as previously described, and can function as an element in a matrix of such lasing devices. The pumping source can be an optical pumping source, such as a pumping laser, or an electrical pumping source having an anode and cathode which contact the nanowire either directly or through ohmic contacts. If a pumping laser is employed, the wavelength of the pump would preferably be higher than the nanowire by greater than approximately 10 meV, and more preferably greater than 100 meV. The nanowire can be placed in a cavity or the ends can be formed with reflective faces so that the nanowire functions as a cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> 6.6 Additional Devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that a number of devices can be fabricated using nanowires and the synthesis methods described above. Additional specific devices include, but are not limited to, the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> 6.6.1 Field-effect Transistor (FET). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> This is a three terminal device that can be realized using COHNs. The current flowing from the &ldquo;source&rdquo; to the &ldquo;drain&rdquo; is controlled by the voltage at the &ldquo;gate&rdquo;. The source and drain can be at any two points along the nanowire that contact the nanowire core. The gate contact is applied to the nanowire sheath at some point between the source and drain. The gate voltage controls the conductivity of the channel between the source and drain. At least two types of FETs can be fabricated in this manner. First, a junction FET is fabricated with a reverse bias pn junction at the gate. In this case the nanowire core is an n-type semiconductor and the sheath is p-type (or vice versa). Applying a reverse bias at the junction can increase the depletion region inside the core and thus inhibit current flow from the source to drain. The second kind of FET is based on metal-oxide (MOSFET) or metal-insulator (MISFET) contact at the gate. In this case the nanowire sheath is made of two sub-sheaths. The nanowire core is first covered with a layer of oxide or insulator and then with a conducting layer. Applying a voltage between the conducting sheath and the nanowire core can remove the channel between source and drain (depletion-mode MOSFET or MISFET) or create a channel (enhancement-mode MOSFET or MISFET) if the nanowire core did not have a conducting channel between the source and drain at zero gate voltage. Additionally, a three-terminal device such as, but not limited to, those depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference> could be utilized with two terminals acting as source and drain and the third acting as a gate. In particular, it is possible to create a MOSFET structure in a three-terminal device in which an insulating heterojunction is placed between the source-drain path and the gate-electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> 6.6.2 Infrared Detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> An infrared (IR) detector can be made using nanowires made of semiconducting material having a bandgap within the infrared wavelengths (1-20 microns). The detector is preferably a two terminal device, with two connections at the two ends of the nanowire. Presence of light changes the conductivity of the nanowire, which is measured using an applied bias between the two terminals (photoconductor); or the light creates a voltage across the nanowire with no external biasing circuit (photovoltaic operation). Photovoltaic operation requires an internal electric field in the nanowire. This can be realized using p-n junction along the nanowire or metal/semiconductor junction at the contacts to the two extremes of nanowire. When the nanowire diameter is smaller than the electron deBroglie wavelength of electrons, quantum confinement effect will change the effective bandgap of material and the region of sensitivity to IR radiation. A second type of IR detector can be fabricated using LOHNs. Similar to quantum well infrared intersubband photodetectors, a series of heterostructures along the direction of nanowire create quantized electronic states inside conduction band or valence band of the material. Optical absorption between these electronic states can be tailored to be at any IR wavelength (1-20 microns), not limited by the bandgap of the material. Again contacts at the two ends of nanowire will allow realization of a photoconductive or photovoltaic IR detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> 6.6.3 Single Electron Infrared Detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> This device is similar to the previous LOHN-based infrared detector. The only difference is that the heterostructure layer parameters (length, nanowire diameter, composition) are chosen so that creation of a free electron inside that particular layer changes the electrostatic energy by an amount so that no other electrons can be transported across this layer until the free electron leaves (coulomb blockade). This enables detecting single electron (and thus single photon) events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> 6.6.4 Resonant Tunneling Diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> This is a two terminal device made of LOHNs. The basic idea is that a LOHN is divided into five segments (emitter, barrier <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, well, barrier <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, collector). The well layer is short enough so that electronic energy states are quantized. The band structure of the barrier layer is chosen so that electron wavefunction is evanescent but the electron transmission probability across the layer is non-zero. Under a bias, electrons are emitted from the emitter contact to the collector contact. At a specific bias, so that the energy of incident electrons from emitter corresponds to the quantized energy levels in the well, transmission across the whole structure is enhanced (resonant tunneling) which gives rise to negative differential resistance in the device current-voltage characteristics, and can be utilized by way of example, to make high speed oscillators or logic circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> 6.6.5 Light Emitting Diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> A single nanowire light emitting diode can be made of pn junction along the nanowire. A heterostructure near the depletion region (where electrons and holes recombine), can be used to make more efficient LEDs by confining the carriers. In order to make LEDs with an array of nanowires, it is important to incorporate an appropriate filling (polymer, etc.) with low absorption and scattering losses. The final device will be composed of two electrodes with nanowire composite in between. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> 6.6.6 Electrically Pumped Laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> This is made of nanowire composite LEDs plus an optical cavity. The optical cavity can be made of dielectric mirrors in vertical configuration (along with contacts to the two sides of the nanowire composite material) or in a horizontal configuration (similar to distributed Bragg reflector lasers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> 6.6.7 Optical Waveguide/Interconnect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, nanowires are used either as a part of composite material (nanowire plus filling material) or light is guided inside the nanowire itself. In the latter case the main parameters in the design are the optical loss along the wire and the number of lateral modes. Typical design is based on COHNs, where the indices of the core and sheath layers are chosen to achieve a specific number of guided modes or group dispersion values (this is similar to the design of silica-based optical fibers). For the former case (nanowire composite material), it can be treated as a new engineered material and conventional methods to fabricate waveguides (ridge type, slab layer, etc.) can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> 6.6.8 Optical Coupler/Modulators/Switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> In the case of nanowire composite materials, basically we will have a filling material (e.g. a polymer) whose electro optical, thermo optical or magneto optical properties are modified by the incorporation of nanowire arrays. One can choose different materials and various wire diameters to tune the required properties (increase electro-optic coefficient, incorporate optical gain with nanowire pn junctions, etc.). Once the nanowire composite material is fabricated, it can be treated as a novel thin film material and conventional techniques to realize waveguide switches, modulators, couplers, etc. can be used. The main advantage is that the rich properties of passive and active heterostructure nanowires is combined with simple processing of polymer based thin film devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> 6.6.9 Electromechanical/Thermomechanical Devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Nanowires made of piezoelectric or piezoresistive materials could be used as electromechanical sensors. Under uniaxial strain, in the direction along the wire (longitudinal), a piezoelectric (e.g., AlN, ZnO) nanowire can produce a voltage signal, whereas a piezoresistive nanowire (e.g., Si) will produce a change in resistance, which can be measured by passing a current. When these are formed into a polymer matrix composite one can essentially get a flexible/conformal material that can be used to detect uniaxial strain. The piezoelectric device can be used to generate uniaxial motion as well. If nanowire heterostructures are formed in a way that a single crystal nanowire is coated on one side with another material (e.g., a partial COHN as described herein), then it could be used to generate bending motion as a bimorph. For example, if the two materials have different thermal expansion coefficients, they could be used for detecting temperature and anything that changes temperature (radiation absorption, electrical dissipation, and for forth). In addition, by changing the temperature this device could be used for thermal actuation. A nanowire-based bimorph can also be used to detect any strain perpendicular to the direction of the nanowire axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> 6.6.10 Chemical Sensing Devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> While nanowires can behave as chemical sensors, they can also be used for chemical logic. For example, consider a LOHN, which has segments of materials A, B, C. Supposing that material A becomes conductive when it adsorbs chemical A&prime;, while similarly B becomes conductive when it adsorbs material B&prime;. Now only in the presence of chemicals A&prime;, B&prime; and C&prime;, will high conductivity exist in the nanowire. This is a sort of chemical logic, i.e. A&prime; and B&prime; and C&prime;&equals;1 such that A&prime; and B&prime; and not C&prime;&equals;0 etc. If you put these structures in series/parallel networks, you could then generate AND and OR logic. One could of course extend this to biological sensing. In fact, it will be much easier for biological sensing, since bio-receptors are highly specific. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> 7. Conclusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing discussion it can be seen that when semiconductors are confined to 2, 1 or 0 dimensional structures in the size range of less than approximately 200 nm, and preferably in the range of approximately 5 nm to 50 nm, their properties can be manipulated in novel ways. The methods described herein along with other chemical synthesis techniques can be used to grow nanowires and associated heterostructures. These structures include coaxial heterostructure nanowires (COHNs) and longitudinal heterostructure nanowires (LOHNs) and combinations thereof. COHNs allow modulation doping such that nanowires with extremely high charge carrier mobility can be obtained, while LOHNs allow bandgap engineering in 1-D, which can lead to multiple quantum dots or pn junctions integrated within a single nanowire. Engineering the band structure near the Fermi level will also allow tailoring of their thermoelectric properties. 1-D confinement has a strong influence on phonon spectra and lifetimes, which could dramatically change their thermal properties. In addition, nanowire heterostructures offer the promising prospects of integrating piezoelectric nanostructures with semiconducting nanowires, resulting in nanoelectromechanical transducers. Also, the elastic boundary conditions in COHNs and LOHNs enable dislocation-free interfaces that are not stable in 2-D (quantum wells and heterostructures) or thin film form, while also providing access to new stable phases that are metastable in bulk or thin film forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> COHNs and LOHNs also lend themselves to the development of energy conversion devices, including thermoelectric refrigerators or power generators, light emitting devices, and nanoelectromechanical transducers. The active material in these devices comprises composites made of nanowire arrays preferably embedded in a polymer matrix, such that they can be patterned and integrated into Microsystems. Semiconducting nanowires with diameters in the 5 nm to 10 nm range provide the unique opportunity to develop thermoelectric refrigerators and power generators with performances comparable to or better than those based on gas or vapor. Such solid-state devices could have enormous impact on energy utilization technology as well as on the environment. Use of nanowires containing integrated quantum dots can all efficient and size-tunable optoelectronic conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, embedding such nanowires in a polymer matrix will produce a light emitting flexible medium with much lower effective index than semiconductors, which will enable efficient coupling with optical fibers and thereby dramatically improve external quantum efficiencies. When combined with single electronics, such quantum dot nanowires offer the possibility of single photonic devices that can significantly impact information storage and processing. Nanowire-based piezoelectric transducers will lead to high quality factor and high resonant frequency devices that can be used for applications ranging from molecular sensing and nano-actuators to high-frequency signal processors. Finally, single-crystalline nanowires with naturally faceted end faces functioning as mirrors can be used for nanolaser devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> LOHNs containing heterostructures along the nanowire length can also be designed to have very interesting properties, including, but not limited to: (a) pn or pnp or various other junctions that could be used for photonic devices, (b) multiple quantum dots with size-tunable optical absorption/emission and single electron tunneling properties, thus leading to single photonic devices; (c) nanowire superlattices with high electron mobility and reduced phonon transport, and thereby useful for thermoelectric devices; and (d) piezoelectric and electronic heterodevices for nanoelectromechanical transduction. Note also that the elastic boundary conditions of nanowire heteroepitaxial growth offer the possibility to create dislocation free interfaces in the superlattice nanowires that are not stable in the conventional 2-D configuration achieved by epitaxial film growth on planar substrates. On the other hand, there are cases where dislocations are desirable as well, and the present invention allows for defect control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Although much effort in the past has been focused on synthesizing and studying zero-dimensional (0-D) (quantum dots) and 2-D (quantum wells and heterostructures) nanostructures, semiconducting nanowires other than carbon nanotubes have received relatively little attention. Note, however, that compared to quantum dots, nanowires that are approximately 1 &mgr;m to approximately 10 &mgr;m long provide the unique opportunity of integrating nanostructures with photolithographically microfabricated features that are generally &ap;1 &mgr;m. In addition, nanowires also allow further confinement over 2-D structures that have been extensively studied and utilized in the past. Because of these favorable attributes, various other types of devices based on nanowire heterostructures can be designed and fabricated as well, including, but not limited to: (i) high efficiency thermoelectric refrigerators or power generators; (ii) tunable light emitting diodes; (iii) piezoelectric nanomechanical sensors and actuators. The use of nanowire heterostructures in these devices is critical, since they would either dramatically improve conversion efficiencies or open up new ways of conversion, as discussed in detail later. These simple devices also form the foundation for more sophisticated devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that various configurations can be achieved using the foregoing inventive structures, some of which have been previously described. By way of further example, and not of limitation, these configurations can include single and multiple junction LOHNs, single and multiple junction COHNs, combinations of LOHN and COHN structures, two-terminal configurations, N&gt;2 terminal configurations, combinations of heterostructures and homostructures, homostructures with one or more electrodes (which would also be an overall heterostructure), heterostructures with one or more electrodes, homostructures with insulators, heterostructures with insulators, and the like. It will also be appreciated that the interface between a nanowire and a terminal constitutes a heterojunction. A variety of devices can be fabricated using these structures and configurations, including, but not limited to, phonon bandgap devices, quantum dots that confine electrons in specific areas, thermoelectric devices (e.g., solid state refrigerators and engines), photonic devices (e.g., nanolasers), nanoelectromechanical (MEM) devices (electromechanical actuators and sensors), energy conversion devices of various forms including for example, light to mechanical energy or thermal energy to light, and other devices. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Zinc fingers belonging to the Cys<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-His<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>family constitute one of the most common DNA-binding motifs found in eukaryotes, and these zinc fingers have provided a very attractive framework for the design and selection of DNA-binding proteins with novel sequence specificities. Numerous studies have used phage display methods or design ideas to explore and systematically alter the specificity of zinc finger-DNA interactions (Desjarlais &amp; Berg, <highlight><italic>Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. </italic></highlight>12:101-104 (1992); Desjarlais &amp; Berg, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90:2256-2260 (1993); Rebar &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>263:671-673 (1994); Jamieson et al., <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>33:5689-5695 (1994); Choo &amp; Klug, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>91:11163-11167 (1994); Wu et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>92:344-348 (1995); and Greisman &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>275:657-661 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Structure based computer design has been used to link Cys<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-His<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>zinc fingers with other DNA-binding domains, including other zinc finger proteins, to generate hybrid proteins that recognize extended sites (Pomerantz et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>267:93-96 (1995); Kim et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>94:3616-3620 (1997)). For example, zinc finger proteins have been linked to a GAL4 dimerization domain to develop novel homo- and hetero-dimers (Pomerantz et al., <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>4:965-970 (1997)), and t0 a nuclease domain to generate novel restriction enzymes (Kim et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>93:1156-1160 (1996)). zinc finger/homeodomain fusion is being tested for potential applications in gene therapy (Rivera et al., <highlight><italic>Nature Med. </italic></highlight>2:1028-1032 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There also have been several attempts to increase affinity and specificity of zinc finger proteins by adding additional fingers to a three-finger protein (Rebar, (Ph.D. Thesis), Selection Studies of Zinc Finger-NA Recognition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1997); Shi, Y. (Ph.D. Thesis) Molecular Mechanisms of Zinc Finger Protein-Nucleic Acid Interactions, Johns Hopkins University (1995)) or by tandemly linking two three-finger proteins (Liu et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>94:5525-5530 (1997)). However, these previous design strategies for poly-finger proteins, which all used canonical &ldquo;TGEKP&rdquo; linkers (linkers having the amino acid sequence threonine-glycine-glutamate-lysine-proline) to connect the additional fingers, resulted in relatively modest increases in affinity. There is thus a need to develop linkers that provide enhanced affinity and specificity to chimeric zinc finger proteins. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> I. Introduction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a design strategy for linkers that fuse two DNA binding domains of a chimeric zinc finger protein. These linkers are flexible and longer than the canonical linkers previously used, allowing binding of the chimeric zinc finger protein to its target site without introducing any strain. The target site is typically a &ldquo;composite&rdquo; target site,&rdquo; composed of two adjacent target sites that are separated by zero to 5 or more nucleotides. Each of the adjacent target sites is recognized by one DNA-binding domain of the chimeric zinc finger protein. The linker design strategy involves structure-based design to determine a minimum length for a linker between two DNA-binding domains, and then adding additional amino acids to the linker to provide at least about 1-2 additional angstroms of flexibility to the linker. The present invention thus provides chimeric zinc finger proteins with femtomolar affinity for their target site, and which effectively repress gene expression, e.g., more than about 70 fold, when targeted to a single site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Structural and biochemical analyses show that DNA often is slightly unwound when bound to zinc finger peptides (Pavletich &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>252:809-817 (1991); Shi &amp; Berg, <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>35:3845-3848 (1996); Nekludova &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>91:6948-6952 (1994)). Modeling studies have shown that on ideal B DNA, the canonical linker is a bit too short to allow favorable docking of Zif268 (Elrod-Erickson et al., <highlight><italic>Structure </italic></highlight>4:1171-1180 (1996)); the DNA must be slightly unwound to interact with zinc fingers in the mode seen in the Zif268 complex. Essentially, it appears that the helical periodicity of the zinc fingers does not quite match the helical periodicity of B-DNA. Since the strain of unwinding may become a more serious problem when there are more fingers (the helical periodicities of the peptide and DNA may get progressively further out of phase), longer, more flexible linkers were tested in the design of poly-finger proteins (see Kim &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat&apos;l Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </italic></highlight>95:2812-2817 (1998), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention demonstrates that linkers of 5 amino acids or more can be used to make chimeric zinc finger proteins with enhanced affinity. For example, a linker of 8 amino acids was used for a chimeric zinc finger protein that recognized adjacent target sites separated by one base pair. A linker of 11 amino acids was used for a chimeric zinc finger protein that recognized adjacent target sites separated by two base pairs. The linkers of the invention can also be designed using structure-based modeling. In structure-based modeling, a model is made that shows the binding of each DNA binding domain polypeptide to its DNA target site. The model is then used to determine the physical separation of the domains as they are bound to adjacent target sites. The physical separation between the domains is used to determine the minimum length of the linker used to connect the C-terminal amino acid of the first domain with the N-terminal amino acid of the second domain, without steric hindrance to the linker or the DNA binding domains. This length is then increased by 1-2 &angst;, to create a slightly longer, flexible linker that avoids introducing strain to the chimeric zinc finger protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Often computer programs are used for structure-based modeling, although the models can also be made physically. Examples of computer programs used for structure-based modeling include Insight II (Biosym Technologies, SanDiego) and Quanta 4.0 (Molecular Simulations (Burlington, Mass.). The programs often use information derived from x-ray crystallographic studies of DNA-binding proteins to provide the appropriate coordinates for proteins. This information can also be obtained from publicly available databases such as the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. This information can also be used to extrapolate distances and coordinates for DNA binding proteins whose crystal structure is unknown. Models of B DNA are well known in the art. The relevant coordinates (e.g., distances and sizes) are used with computer modeling program of choice, using the manufacture&apos;s instructions and default parameters. Alternatively, customized parameters can be used. Structure-based modeling can be performed as described in, e.g., Kim &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat&apos;l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </italic></highlight>95:2812-2817 (1998); Pavletich &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>252:809-817 (1991); Rebar, Ph.D. Thesis (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge Mass.) (1997); Liu et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat&apos;l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </italic></highlight>94:5525-5530 (1997); Pomerantz et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>267:93-96 (1995); Pomerantz et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat&apos;l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </italic></highlight>92:9752-9756 (1995); Li et al., <highlight><italic>Nature Biotechnology </italic></highlight>16:190-195 (1998); Kim et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>94:3616-3620 (1997); and Pomerantz et al., <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>4:965-970 (1997), herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Two basic criteria suggest which alignments of DNA-binding domains have potential for combination in a chimeric protein which binds DNA: (1) lack of collision between domains, and (2) consistent positioning of the carboxyl- and amino-terminal regions of the domains, i.e., the domains are oriented such that the carboxyl-terminal region of one polypeptide can be joined to the amino-terminal region of the next polypeptide </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The linker used to link the two DNA-binding domains can comprise any amino acid sequence that does not substantially hinder interaction of the DNA-binding domains with their respective target sites. Preferred amino acid residues for linkers of the present invention include, but are not limited to glycine, alanine, leucine, serine, valine and threonine. Once the length of the amino acid sequence has been selected, the sequence of the linker can be selected, e.g., by phage display library technology (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,203), or using naturally occurring or synthetic linker sequences as a scaffold (e.g., GTGQKP and GEKP, see Liu et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat&apos;l Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </italic></highlight>94:5525-5530 (1997); see also Whitlow et al., Methods: <highlight><italic>A Companion to Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>2:97-105 (1991)). Typically, the linkers of the invention are made by making recombinant nucleic acids encoding the linker and the DNA-binding domains, which are fused via the linker amino acid sequence. Optionally, the linkers can also be made using peptide synthesis, and then linked to the polypeptide DNA-binding domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The chimeric zinc finger proteins of the invention are composed of two or more DNA-binding domains, where at least one of the DNA binding domains is a zinc finger polypeptide. The second DNA binding domain can be a zinc finger binding domain, either the same domain or a heterologous domain. Suitable zinc finger proteins include any protein from the Cys<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>-His<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>family, e.g., SP-1, SP-1C, ZIF268, NRE, Tramtrack, GLI, YY1, or TFIIIA (see, e.g., Jacobs, <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>11:4507 (1992); Desjarlais &amp; Berg, <highlight><italic>PNAS </italic></highlight>90:2256-2260 (1993); Christy et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS </italic></highlight>85:7857-7861 (1988); Greisman &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>275:657-661 (1997); Fairall et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>366:483 (1993); Paveltich et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>261:1701 (1993)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The second DNA binding domain can also be a heterologous DNA binding domain, e.g., from a restriction enzyme; a nuclear hormone receptor; a homeodomain protein or a helix turn helix motif protein such as MAT 1, MAT 2, MAT al, Antennapedia, Ultrabithorax, Engrailed, Paired, Fushi tarazu, HOX, Unc86, Oct1, Oct2, Pit, lambda repressor and tet repressor; Gal 4; TATA binding protein; helix loop helix motif proteins such as myc, myo D, Daughterless, Achaete-scute (T3), E12, and E47; leucine zipper type proteins such as GCN4, C/EBP, c-Fos/c-Jun and JunB; and beta sheet motif proteins such as met, arc, and mnt repressors. In another embodiment, the zinc finger protein is linked to at least one or more regulatory domains, described below. Preferred regulatory domains include transcription factor repressor or activator domains such as KRAB and VP16, co-repressor and co-activator domains, DNA methyl transferases, histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, and endonucleases such as Fok1. The amino acid sequences of the DNA-binding domains may be naturally-occurring or non-naturally-occurring (or modified). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The expression of chimeric zinc finger proteins can be also controlled by systems typified by the tet-regulated systems and the RU-486 system (see, e.g., Gossen &amp; Bujard, PNAS 89:5547 (1992); Oligino et al., <highlight><italic>Gene Ther. </italic></highlight>5:491-496 (1998); Wang et al., <highlight><italic>Gene Ther. </italic></highlight>4:432-441 (1997); Neering et al., <highlight><italic>Blood </italic></highlight>88:1147-1155 (1996); and Rendahl et al., <highlight><italic>Nat. Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>16:757-761(1998)). These impart small molecule control on the expression of the chimeric zinc finger protein and thus impart small molecule control on the target gene(s) of interest. This beneficial feature could be used in cell culture models, in gene therapy, and in transgenic animals and plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The binding specificity of the chimeric DNA-binding proteins makes them particularly useful because they have DNA-binding properties distinct from those of known proteins. The chimeric proteins prefer to bind the adjacent target sites and, thus, can be used to modulate expression of genes having the adjacent target sites. These chimeric zinc finger proteins have an affinity for the adjacent target sites that is in the femtomolar range, e.g., 100 femtomoles, 10 femtomoles, or less, in some cases as low as 2-4 femtomoles, and in some cases 1 femtomolar or lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The zinc finger proteins made using the method of the invention have numerous applications, including therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications such as in cell or animal models and functional genomics. For example, zinc finger proteins can be used to regulate gene expression, allowing for novel human and mammalian therapeutic applications, e.g., treatment of genetic diseases, cancer, fungal, protozoal, bacterial, and viral infection, ischemia, vascular disease, arthritis, immunological disorders, etc., as well as providing means for developing plants with altered phenotypes, including disease resistance, fruit ripening, sugar and oil composition, yield, and color. In addition, the zinc finger proteins of the present invention can be used for diagnostic assays and for functional genomics assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As described herein, zinc finger proteins can be designed to recognize any suitable target site for any of the uses described herein, e.g., eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes, cellular genes, viral genes, protozoal genes, fungal genes, and bacterial genes. In general, suitable genes to be regulated include cytokines, lymphokines, growth factors, mitogenic factors, chemotactic factors, onco-active factors, receptors, potassium channels, G-proteins, signal transduction molecules, and other disease-related genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A general theme in transcription factor function is that simple binding and sufficient proximity to the promoter are all that is generally needed. Exact positioning relative to the promoter, orientation, and within limits, distance do not matter greatly. This feature allows considerable flexibility in choosing sites for constructing zinc finger proteins. The target site recognized by the zinc finger protein therefore can be any suitable site in the target gene that will allow activation or repression of gene expression by a zinc finger protein, optionally linked to a regulatory domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Preferred target sites include regions adjacent to, downstream, or upstream of the transcription start site. In addition, target sites that are located in enhancer regions, repressor sites, RNA polymerase pause sites, and specific regulatory sites (e.g., SP-1 sites, hypoxia response elements, nuclear receptor recognition elements, p53 binding sites), sites in the cDNA encoding region or in an expressed sequence tag (EST) coding region. As described below, typically each finger recognizes 2-4 base pairs, with a two finger zinc finger protein binding to a 4 to 7 bp target site, a three finger zinc finger protein binding to a 6 to 10 base pair site, and a six finger zinc finger protein binding to two adjacent target sites, each target site having from 6-10 base pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Chimeric zinc finger proteins of the invention can be tested for activity in vivo using a simple assay (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel et al., eds, 1994)). The in vivo assay uses a plasmid encoding the chimeric zinc finger protein, which is co-expressed with a reporter plasmid containing a test gene, e.g., the luciferase gene, the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene or the human growth hormone (hGH) gene, with a target site for the chimeric zinc finger protein. The two plasmids are introduced together into host cells. A second group of cells serves as the control group and receives a plasmid encoding the transcription factor and a plasmid containing the reporter gene without the binding site for the transcription factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The production of reporter gene transcripts or the amount of activity of the relevant protein is measured; if mRNA synthesis from the reporter gene or the amount of activity of the relevant protein is greater than that of the control gene, the transcription factor is a positive regulator of transcription. If reporter gene mRNA synthesis or the amount of activity of the relevant protein is less than that of the control, the transcription factor is a negative regulator of transcription. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Optionally, the assay may include a transfection efficiency control plasmid. This plasmid expresses a gene product independent of the reporter gene, and the amount of this gene product indicates roughly how many cells are taking up the plasmids and how efficiently the DNA is being introduced into the cells. The chimeric zinc finger protein can also be tested for modulation of an endogenous gene in vivo, using methods known to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the present invention provides a fusion in which the three-finger Zif268 peptide was linked to a designed three-finger peptide (designated &ldquo;NRE&rdquo;) that specifically recognizes a nuclear hormone response element (Greisman &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>275:657 (1997)). Gel shift assays indicate that this six-finger peptide, 268//NRE, binds to a composite 18 bp DNA site with a dissociation constant in the femtomolar range. The slightly longer linkers used in this fusion protein provide a dramatic improvement in DNA-binding affinity, working much better than the canonical &ldquo;TGEKP&rdquo; linkers that have been used in previous studies. Tissue culture transfection experiments also show that the 268//NRE peptide is an extremely effective repressor, giving 72-fold repression when targeted to a binding site close to the transcription start site. Using this strategy and linking peptides selected via phage display allows the design of novel DNA-binding proteins with extraordinary affinity and specificity for use in biological applications and gene therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The new six-finger peptides bind far more tightly than previously reported poly-finger proteins which used a conventional &ldquo;TGEKP&rdquo; linker to connect two three-finger modules or to add additional fingers to a three-finger protein. Poly-finger proteins with canonical linkers had been tested by Rebar (Rebar, (Ph.D. Thesis), Selection Studies of Zinc Finger-DNA Recognition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1997)), by Shi (Shi, (Ph.D. Thesis), Molecular Mechanisms of zinc Finger Protein-Nucleic Acid Interactions, Johns Hopkins University (1995)), and by Liu et al. (Liu et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>94:5525-5530 (1997)). Each study compared binding of the new poly-finger protein (at the appropriate extended site) with binding of the original three-finger peptide. Using canonical linkers, a four-finger peptide bound 6.3 times more tightly than the corresponding three-finger peptide (Rebar ( Ph.D. Thesis), Selection Studies of Zinc Finger-DNA Recognition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1997)), a five-finger construct showed no improvement in K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>over the original three-finger peptide (Shi, (Ph.D. Thesis), Molecular Mechanisms of Zinc Finger Protein-Nucleic Acid Interactions, Johns Hopkins University (1995)), and six-finger peptides bound 58-74-fold more tightly than the corresponding three-finger peptides (Liu et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>94:5525-5530 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In contrast, the peptides described herein (see Example section) bind 6,000-90,000-fold more tightly than the original three-finger peptides. It seems likely that the longer linkers used in the 268/NRE and 268//NRE constructs must relieve some strain that accumulates when a larger set of fingers all are connected with canonical linkers. Presumably this involves a slight mismatch in the helical periodicity of the DNA and the preferred helical periodicity of the zinc fingers, causing them to fall slightly out of register, particularly when 4 or more fingers are connected via canonical linkers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> II. Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the following terms have the meanings ascribed to them unless specified otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;zinc finger protein&rdquo; or &ldquo;ZFP&rdquo; or &ldquo;zinc finger polypeptide&rdquo; refers to a protein having DNA binding domains that are stabilized by zinc. The individual DNA binding domains are typically referred to as &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; A zinc finger protein has least one finger, typically two fingers, three fingers, or six fingers. Each finger binds from two to four base pairs of DNA, typically three or four base pairs of DNA (the &ldquo;subsite&rdquo;). A zinc finger protein binds to a nucleic acid sequence called a target site or target segment. Each finger typically comprises an approximately 30 amino acid, zinc-chelating, DNA-binding subdomain. An exemplary motif characterizing one class of these proteins (C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>class) is -Cys-(X)<highlight><subscript>24</subscript></highlight>-Cys-(X)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>-His-(X)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-5-His (where X is any amino acid). Studies have demonstrated that a single zinc finger of this class consists of an alpha helix containing the two invariant histidine residues coordinated with zinc along with the two cysteine residues of a single beta turn (see, e.g., Berg &amp; Shi, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>271:1081-1085 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;chimeric&rdquo; zinc finger protein refers to a protein that has at least two DNA-binding domains, one of which is a zinc finger polypeptide, linked to the other domain via a flexible linker. The two domains can be the same or heterologous. Both domains can be zinc finger proteins, either the same zinc finger protein or heterologous zinc finger proteins. Alternatively, one domain can be a heterologous DNA-binding protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;target site&rdquo; is the nucleic acid sequence recognized by a zinc finger protein or a heterologous DNA-binding polypeptide. For a zinc finger protein, a single target site typically has about four to about ten base pairs. Typically, a two-fingered zinc finger protein recognizes a four to seven base pair target site, a three-fingered zinc finger protein recognizes a six to ten base pair target site, and a six fingered zinc finger protein recognizes two adjacent nine to ten base pair target sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;subsite&rdquo; is a subsequence of the target site, and corresponds to a portion of the target site recognized by a single finger, e.g., a 2-4 base subsite, typically a 3 base subsite. A target site comprises at least two, typically three, four, five, six or more subsites, one for each finger of the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;adjacent target sites&rdquo; refers to non-overlapping target sites that are separated by zero to about 5 base pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;physical separation&rdquo; between two DNA-binding domains refers to the distance between two domains when they are bound to their respective target sites. This distance is used to determine a minimum length of a linker. A minimum length of a linker is the length that would allow the two domains to be connected without providing steric hindrance to the domains or the linker (a minimum linker). A linker that provides more than the minimum length is a &ldquo;flexible linker.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Structure based design&rdquo; refers to methods of determining the length of minimum linkers and flexible linkers, using physical or computer models of DNA-binding proteins bound to their respective target sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;K<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; refers to the dissociation constant for the compound, i.e., the concentration of a compound (e.g., a zinc finger protein) that gives half maximal binding of the compound to its target (i.e., half of the compound molecules are bound to the target) under given conditions (i.e., when &lsqb;target&rsqb;&lt;&lt;K<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>), as measured using a given assay system (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,538). The assay system used to measure the K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>should be chosen so that it gives the most accurate measure of the actual K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>of the zinc finger protein. Any assay system can be used, as long is it gives an accurate measurement of the actual K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>of the zinc finger protein. In one embodiment, the K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>for the zinc finger proteins of the invention is measured using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (&ldquo;EMSA&rdquo;), as described in herein. Unless an adjustment is made for zinc finger protein purity or activity, K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>calculations may result in an underestimate of the true K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>of a given zinc finger protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The phrase &ldquo;adjacent to a transcription initiation site&rdquo; refers to a target site that is within about 50 bases either upstream or downstream of a transcription initiation site. &ldquo;Upstream&rdquo; of a transcription initiation site refers to a target site that is more than about 50 bases 5&prime; of the transcription initiation site (i.e., in the non-transcribed region of the gene). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The phrase &ldquo;RNA polymerase pause site&rdquo; is described in Uptain et al., <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>66:117-172 (1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;heterologous&rdquo; is a relative term, which when used with reference to portions of a nucleic acid indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature. For instance, a nucleic acid that is recombinantly produced typically has two or more sequences from unrelated genes synthetically arranged to make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter from one source and a coding region from another source. The two nucleic acids are thus heterologous to each other in this context. When added to a cell, the recombinant nucleic acids would also be heterologous to the endogenous genes of the cell. Thus, in a chromosome, a heterologous nucleic acid would include an non-native (non-naturally occurring) nucleic acid that has integrated into the chromosome, or a non-native (non-naturally occurring) extrachromosomal nucleic acid. In contrast, a naturally translocated piece of chromosome would not be considered heterologous in the context of this patent application, as it comprises an endogenous nucleic acid sequence that is native to the mutated cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;regulatory domain&rdquo; refers to a protein or a protein domain that has an activity such as transcriptional modulation activity, DNA modifying activity, protein modifying activity and the like when tethered to a DNA binding domain, i.e., a zinc finger protein. Examples of regulatory domains include proteins or effector domains of proteins, e.g., transcription factors and co-factors (e.g., KRAB, MAD, ERD, SID, nuclear factor kappa B subunit p65, early growth response factor 1, and nuclear hormone receptors, VP 16, VP64), endonucleases, integrases, recombinases, methyltransferases, histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases etc. Activators and repressors include co-activators and co-repressors (see, e.g., Utley et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>394:498-502 (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;heterologous DNA-binding domain&rdquo; refers to a DNA binding domain from a protein that is not a zinc finger protein, such restriction enzyme, a nuclear hormone receptor, a homeodomain protein such as engrailed or antenopedia, a bacterial helix turn helix motif protein such as lambda repressor and tet repressor, Gal 4, TATA binding protein, helix loop helix motif proteins such as myc and myo D, leucine zipper type proteins such as fos and jun, and beta sheet motif proteins such as met, arc, and mnt repressors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Humanized&rdquo; refers to a non-human polypeptide sequence that has been modified to minimize immunoreactivity in humans, typically by altering the amino acid sequence to mimic existing human sequences, without substantially altering the function of the polypeptide sequence (see, e.g., Jones et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>321:522-525 (1986), and published UK patent application No. 8707252). Backbone sequences for the zinc finger proteins are preferably be selected from existing human C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>zinc finger proteins (e.g., SP-1). Functional domains are preferably selected from existing human genes, (e.g., the activation domain from the p65 subunit of NF-&kgr;B). Where possible, the recognition helix sequences will be selected from the thousands of existing zinc finger protein DNA recognition domains provided by sequencing the human genome. As much as possible, domains will be combined as units from the same existing proteins. All of these steps will minimize the introduction of new junctional epitopes in the chimeric zinc finger proteins and render the engineered zinc finger proteins less immunogenic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Nucleic acid&rdquo; refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-O-methyl ribonucleotides, peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs). Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. The term nucleic acid is used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, mRNA, oligonucleotide, and polynucleotide. The nucleotide sequences are displayed herein in the conventional 5&prime;-3&prime; orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;polypeptide,&rdquo; &ldquo;peptide&rdquo; and &ldquo;protein&rdquo; are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an analog or mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers. Polypeptides can be modified, e.g., by the addition of carbohydrate residues to form glycoproteins. The terms &ldquo;polypeptide,&rdquo; &ldquo;peptide&rdquo; and &ldquo;protein&rdquo; include glycoproteins, as well as non-glycoproteins. The polypeptide sequences are displayed herein in the conventional N-terminal to C-terminal orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;amino acid&rdquo; refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, carboxyglutamate, and-O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an cc carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine, and methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally occurring amino acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Conservatively modified variants&rdquo; applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acid Res. </italic></highlight>19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>260:2605-2608 (1985); Rossolini et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell. Probes </italic></highlight>8:91-98 (1994)). Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon in an amino acid herein, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are &ldquo;silent variations,&rdquo; which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As to amino acid and nucleic acid sequences, individual substitutions, deletions or additions that alter, add or delete a single amino acid or nucleotide or a small percentage of amino acids or nucleotides in the sequence create a &ldquo;conservatively modified variant,&rdquo; where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants and alleles of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The following groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> 1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 2) Serine (S), Threonine (T); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> 3) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> (see, e.g., Creighton, <highlight><italic>Proteins </italic></highlight>(1984) for a discussion of amino acid properties). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> III. Design of Zinc Finger Proteins </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The chimeric zinc finger proteins of the invention comprise at least one zinc finger polypeptide linked via a flexible linker to at least a second DNA binding domain, which optionally is a second zinc finger polypeptide. The chimeric zinc finger protein may contain more than two DNA-binding domains, as well as one or more regulator domains. The zinc finger polypeptides of the invention can be engineered to recognize a selected target site in the gene of choice. Typically, a backbone from any suitable C<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>ZFP, such as SP-1, SP-1C, or ZIF268, is used as the scaffold for the engineered zinc finger polypeptides (see, e.g., Jacobs, <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>11:4507 (1992); Desjarlais &amp; Berg, <highlight><italic>PNAS </italic></highlight>90:2256-2260 (1993)). A number of methods can then be used to design and select a zinc finger polypeptide with high affinity for its target. A zinc finger polypeptide can be designed or selected to bind to any suitable target site in the target gene, with high affinity. Co-pending patent application U.S. Ser. No. ______, filed Jan. 12, 1999 (TTC attorney docket no. 019496-001800, herein incorporated by reference), comprehensively describes methods for design, construction, and expression of zinc finger polypeptides for selected target sites. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, copending application U.S. Ser. No. ______, filed Jan. 12, 1999 (TTC attorney docket no. 019496-001800) provides methods that select a target gene, and identify a target site within the gene containing one to six (or more) D-able sites (see definition below). Using these methods, a zinc finger polypeptide can then be synthesized that binds to the preselected site. These methods of target site selection are premised, in part, on the recognition that the presence of one or more D-able sites in a target segment confers the potential for higher binding affinity in a zinc finger polypeptide selected or designed to bind to that site relative to zinc finger polypeptides that bind to target segments lacking D-able sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A D-able site or subsite is a region of a target site that allows an appropriately designed single zinc finger to bind to four bases rather than three of the target site. Such a zinc finger binds to a triplet of bases on one strand of a double-stranded target segment (target strand) and a fourth base on the other strand (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of copending application U.S. Ser. No. ______, filed Jan. 12, 1999 (TTC attorney docket no. 019496-0018Q0). Binding of a single zinc finger to a four base target segment imposes constraints both on the sequence of the target strand and on the amino acid sequence of the zinc finger. The target site within the target strand should include the &ldquo;D-able&rdquo; site motif 5&prime; NNGK 3&prime;, in which N and K are conventional IUPAC-IUB ambiguity codes. A zinc finger for binding to such a site should include an arginine residue at position -1 and an aspartic acid, (or less preferably a glutamic acid) at position &plus;2. The arginine residues at position -1 interacts with the G residue in the D-able site. The aspartic acid (or glutamic acid) residue at position &plus;2 of the zinc finger interacts with the opposite strand base complementary to the K base in the D-able site. It is the interaction between aspartic acid (symbol D) and the opposite strand base (fourth base) that confers the name D-able site. As is apparent from the D-able site formula, there are two subtypes of D-able sites: 5&prime; NNGG 3&prime; and 5&prime; NNGT 3&prime;. For the former site, the aspartic acid or glutamic acid at position &plus;2 of a zinc finger interacts with a C in the opposite strand to the D-able site. In the latter site, the aspartic acid or glutamic acid at position &plus;2 of a zinc finger interacts with an A in the opposite strand to the D-able site. In general, NNGG is preferred over NNGT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the design of a zinc finger polypeptide with three fingers, a target site should be selected in which at least one finger of the protein, and optionally, two or all three fingers have the potential to bind a D-able site. Such can be achieved by selecting a target site from within a larger target gene having the formula 5&prime;-NNx aNy bNzc-3&prime;, wherein </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> each of the sets (x, a), (y, b) and (z, c) is either (N, N) or (G, K); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> at least one of (x, a), (y, b) and (z, c) is (G, K), and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> N and K are IUPAC-IUB ambiguity codes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In other words, at least one of the three sets (x, a), (y, b) and (z, c) is the set (G, K), meaning that the first position of the set is G and the second position is G or T. Those of the three sets (if any) which are not (G, K) are (N, N), meaning that the first position of the set can be occupied by any nucleotide and the second position of the set can be occupied by any nucleotide. As an example, the set (x, a) can be (G, K) and the sets (y, b) and (z, c) can both be (N, N). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In the formula 5&prime;-NNx aNy bNzc-3&prime;, the triplets of NNx aNy and bNzc represent the triplets of bases on the target strand bound by the three fingers in a zinc finger polypeptide. If only one of x, y and z is a G, and this G is followed by a K, the target site includes a single D-able subsite. For example, if only x is G, and a is K, the site reads 5&prime;-NNG KNy bNzc-3&prime; with the D-able subsite highlighted. If both x and y but not z are G, and a and b are K, then the target site has two overlapping D-able subsites as follows: 5&prime;-NNG KNG KNz c-3&prime;, with one such site being represented in bold and the other in italics. If all three of x, y and z are G and a, b, and c are K, then the target segment includes three D-able subsites, as follows 5&prime;NNG KNG KNG K3&prime;, the D-able subsites being represented by bold, italics and underline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> These methods thus work by selecting a target gene, and systematically searching within the possible subsequences of the gene for target sites conforming to the formula 5&prime;-NNx aNy bNzc-3&prime;, as described above. In some such methods, every possible subsequence of 10 contiguous bases on either strand of a potential target gene is evaluated to determine whether it conforms to the above formula, and, if so, how many D-able sites are present. Typically, such a comparison is performed by computer, and a list of target sites conforming to the formula are output. Optionally, such target sites can be output in different subsets according to how many D-able sites are present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In a variation, the methods of the invention identify first and second target segments, each independently conforming to the above formula. The two target segments in such methods are constrained to be adjacent or proximate (i.e., within about 0-5 bases) of each other in the target gene. The strategy underlying selection of proximate target segments is to allow the design of a zinc finger polypeptide formed by linkage of two component zinc finger polypeptides specific for the first and second target segments respectively. These principles can be extended to select target sites to be bound by zinc finger polypeptides with any number of component fingers. For example, a suitable target site for a nine finger protein would have three component segments, each conforming to the above formula. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The target sites identified by the above methods can be subject to further evaluation by other criteria or can be used directly for design or selection (if needed) and production of a zinc finger polypeptide specific for such a site. A further criteria for evaluating potential target sites is their proximity to particular regions within a gene. If a zinc finger polypeptide is to be used to repress a cellular gene on its own (i.e., without linking the zinc finger polypeptide to a repressing moiety), then the optimal location appears to be at, or within 50 bp upstream or downstream of the site of transcription initiation, to interfere with the formation of the transcription complex (Kim &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:29795-296800 (1997)) or compete for an essential enhancer binding protein. If, however, a zinc finger polypeptide is fused to a functional domain such as the KRAB repressor domain or the VP16 activator domain, the location of the binding site is considerably more flexible and can be outside known regulatory regions. For example, a KRAB domain can repress transcription at a promoter up to at least 3 kbp from where KRAB is bound (Margolin et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS </italic></highlight>91:4509-4513 (1994)). Thus, target sites can be selected that do not necessarily include or overlap segments of demonstrable biological significance with target genes, such as regulatory sequences. Other criteria for further evaluating target segments include the prior availability of zinc finger polypeptide s binding to such segments or related segments, and/or ease of designing new zinc finger polypeptides to bind a given target segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> After a target segment has been selected, a zinc finger polypeptide that binds to the segment can be provided by a variety of approaches. The simplest of approaches is to provide a precharacterized zinc finger polypeptide from an existing collection that is already known to bind to the target site. However, in many instances, such zinc finger polypeptides do not exist. An alternative approach can also be used to design new v zinc finger polypeptides, which uses the information in a database of existing zinc finger polypeptides and their respective binding affinities. A further approach is to design a zinc finger polypeptide based on substitution rules as discussed above. A still further alternative is to select a zinc finger polypeptide with specificity for a given target by an empirical process such as phage display. In some such methods, each component finger of a zinc finger polypeptide is designed or selected independently of other component fingers. For example, each finger can be obtained from a different preexisting zinc finger polypeptide or each finger can be subject to separate randomization and selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Once a zinc finger polypeptide has been selected, designed, or otherwise provided to a given target segment, the zinc finger polypeptide or the DNA encoding it are synthesized. Exemplary methods for synthesizing and expressing DNA encoding zinc finger proteins are described below. The zinc finger polypeptide or a polynucleotide encoding it can then be used for modulation of expression, or analysis of the target gene containing the target site to which the zinc finger polypeptide binds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> IV. Expression and Purification of Zinc Finger Proteins made using the Methods of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Chimeric zinc finger proteins comprising a flexible linker and nucleic acids encoding such chimeric zinc finger proteins can be made using routine techniques in the field of recombinant genetics. Basic texts disclosing the general methods of use in this invention include Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(2nd ed. 1989); Kriegler, <highlight><italic>Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(1990); and <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology </italic></highlight>(Ausubel et al., eds., 1994)). In addition, essentially any nucleic acid can be custom ordered from any of a variety of commercial sources. Similarly, peptides and antibodies can be custom ordered from any of a variety of commercial sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Two alternative methods are typically used to create the coding sequences required to express newly designed DNA-binding polypeptides and the flexible linker. One protocol is a PCR-based assembly procedure that utilizes six overlapping oligonucleotides (to make one three finger zinc finger polypeptide). Three oligonucleotides correspond to &ldquo;universal&rdquo; sequences that encode portions of the DNA-binding domain between the recognition helices. These oligonucleotides remain constant for all zinc finger constructs. The other three &ldquo;specific&rdquo; oligonucleotides are designed to encode the recognition helices. These oligonucleotides contain substitutions primarily at positions -1, 2, 3 and 6 on the recognition helices making them specific for each of the different zinc fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> To make a three finger zinc finger polypeptide, the PCR synthesis is carried out in two steps. First, a double stranded DNA template is created by combining the six oligonucleotides (three universal, three specific) in a four cycle PCR reaction with a low temperature annealing step, thereby annealing the oligonucleotides to form a DNA &ldquo;scaffold.&rdquo; The gaps in the scaffold are filled in by high-fidelity thermostable polymerase, the combination of Taq and Pfu polymerases also suffices. In the second phase of construction, the zinc finger template is amplified by external primers designed to incorporate restriction sites at either end for cloning into a shuttle vector or directly into an expression vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> An alternative method of cloning the newly designed DNA-binding proteins relies on annealing complementary oligonucleotides encoding the specific regions of the desired chimeric zinc finger protein. This particular application requires that the oligonucleotides be phosphorylated prior to the final ligation step. This is usually performed before setting up the annealing reactions, but kinasing can also occur post-annealing. In brief, the &ldquo;universal&rdquo; oligonucleotides encoding the constant regions of the proteins (oligos 1, 2 and 3 of above) are annealed with their complementary oligonucleotides. Additionally, the &ldquo;specific&rdquo; oligonucleotides encoding the finger recognition helices are annealed with their respective complementary oligonucleotides. These complementary oligos are designed to fill in the region which was previously filled in by polymerase in the protocol described above. The complementary oligos to the common oligos 1 and finger 3 are engineered to leave overhanging sequences specific for the restriction sites used in cloning into the vector of choice. The second assembly protocol differs from the initial protocol in the following aspects: the &ldquo;scaffold&rdquo; encoding the newly designed ZFP is composed entirely of synthetic DNA thereby eliminating the polymerase fill-in step, additionally the fragment to be cloned into the vector does not require amplification. Lastly, the design of leaving sequence-specific overhangs eliminates the need for restriction enzyme digests of the inserting fragment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The resulting fragment encoding the newly designed zinc finger polypeptide is ligated into an expression vector. The sequences encoding the flexible linker and the second DNA-binding domain (optionally a zinc finger polypeptide) are also ligated into the vector to create a chimeric zinc finger proteins. Typically, the flexible linker is encoded by a oligonucleotide that is ligated into the expression vector between the two DNA binding domains. The second DNA binding domain can be made as described above, or can be cloned or obtained from an alternative source using methods well known in the art, e.g., PCR and the like. Expression vectors that are commonly utilized include, but are not limited to, a modified pMAL-c2 bacterial expression vector (New England BioLabs, &ldquo;NEB&rdquo;) or a eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA (Promega). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid encoding the chimeric zinc finger protein of choice is typically cloned into intermediate vectors for transformation into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells for replication and/or expression, e.g., for determination of K<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>. Intermediate vectors are typically prokaryote vectors, e.g., plasmids, or shuttle vectors, or insect vectors, for storage or manipulation of the nucleic acid encoding zinc finger protein or production of protein. The nucleic acid encoding a zinc finger protein is also typically cloned into an expression vector, for administration to a plant cell, animal cell, preferably a mammalian cell or a human cell, fungal cell, bacterial cell, or protozoal cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> To obtain expression of a cloned gene or nucleic acid, a chimeric zinc finger protein is typically subcloned into an expression vector that contains a promoter to direct transcription. Suitable bacterial and eukaryotic promoters are well known in the art and described, e.g., in Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(2nd ed. 1989); Kriegler, <highlight><italic>Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(1990); and <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology </italic></highlight>(Ausubel et al., eds., 1994). Bacterial expression systems for expressing the zinc finger protein are available in, e.g., <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, Bacillus sp., and Salmonella (Palva et al., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>22:229-235 (1983)). Kits for such expression systems are commercially available. Eukaryotic expression systems for mammalian cells, yeast, and insect cells are well known in the art and are also commercially available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The promoter used to direct expression of a chimeric zinc finger protein nucleic acid depends on the particular application. For example, a strong constitutive promoter is typically used for expression and purification of zinc finger protein. In contrast, when a zinc finger protein is administered in vivo for gene regulation, either a constitutive or an inducible promoter is used, depending on the particular use of the zinc finger protein. The promoter typically can also include elements that are responsive to transactivation, e.g., hypoxia response elements, Gal4 response elements, lac repressor response element, and small molecule control systems such as tet-regulated systems and the RU-486 system (see, e.g., Gossen &amp; Bujard, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </italic></highlight>89:5547 (1992); Oligino et al., <highlight><italic>Gene Ther. </italic></highlight>5:491-496 (1998); Wang et al., <highlight><italic>Gene Ther. </italic></highlight>4:432-441 (1997); Neering et al., <highlight><italic>Blood </italic></highlight>88:1147-1155 (1996); and Rendahl et al., <highlight><italic>Nat. Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>16:757-761 (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In addition to the promoter, the expression vector typically contains a transcription unit or expression cassette that contains all the additional elements required for the expression of the nucleic acid in host cells, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. A typical expression cassette thus contains a promoter operably linked, e.g., to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the zinc finger protein, and signals required, e.g., for efficient polyadenylation of the transcript, transcriptional termination, ribosome binding sites, or translation termination. Additional elements of the cassette may include, e.g., enhancers, and heterologous spliced intronic signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The particular expression vector used to transport the genetic information into the cell is selected with regard to the intended use of the zinc finger protein, e.g., expression in plants, animals, bacteria, fungus, protozoa, etc. Standard bacterial expression vectors include plasmids such as pBR322 based plasmids, pSKF, pET23D, and commercially available fusion expression systems such as GST and LacZ. A preferred fusion protein is the maltose binding protein, &ldquo;MBP.&rdquo; Such fusion proteins are used for purification of the zinc finger protein. Epitope tags can also be added to recombinant proteins to provide convenient methods of isolation, for monitoring expression, and for monitoring cellular and subcellular localization, e.g., c-myc or FLAG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Expression vectors containing regulatory elements from eukaryotic viruses are often used in eukaryotic expression vectors, e.g., SV40 vectors, papilloma virus vectors, and vectors derived from Epstein-Barr virus. Other exemplary eukaryotic vectors include pMSG, pAV009/A&plus;, pMTO10/A&plus;, pMAMneo-5, baculovirus pDSVE, and any other vector allowing expression of proteins under the direction of the SV40 early promoter, SV40 late promoter, metallothionein promoter, murine mammary tumor virus promoter, Rous sarcoma virus promoter, polyhedrin promoter, or other promoters shown effective for expression in eukaryotic cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Some expression systems have markers for selection of stably transfected cell lines such as thymidine kinase, hygromycin B phosphotransferase, and dihydrofolate reductase. High yield expression systems are also suitable, such as using a baculovirus vector in insect cells, with a zinc finger protein encoding sequence under the direction of the polyhedrin promoter or other strong baculovirus promoters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The elements that are typically included in expression vectors also include a replicon that functions in <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, a gene encoding antibiotic resistance to permit selection of bacteria that harbor recombinant plasmids, and unique restriction sites in nonessential regions of the plasmid to allow insertion of recombinant sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Standard transfection methods are used to produce bacterial, mammalian, yeast or insect cell lines that express large quantities of protein, which are then purified using standard techniques (see, e.g., Colley et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>264:17619-17622 (1989); <highlight><italic>Guide to Protein Purification, in Methods in Enzymology</italic></highlight>, vol. 182 (Deutscher, ed., 1990)). Transformation of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells are performed according to standard techniques (see, e.g., Morrison, <highlight><italic>J. Bact. </italic></highlight>132:349-351 (1977); Clark-Curtiss &amp; Curtiss, <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology </italic></highlight>101:347-362 (Wu et al., eds, 1983). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Any of the well known procedures for introducing foreign nucleotide sequences into host cells may be used. These include the use of calcium phosphate transfection, polybrene, protoplast fusion, electroporation, liposomes, microinjection, naked DNA, plasmid vectors, viral vectors, both episomal and integrative, and any of the other well known methods for introducing cloned genomic DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA or other foreign genetic material into a host cell (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., supra). It is only necessary that the particular genetic engineering procedure used be capable of successfully introducing at least one gene into the host cell capable of expressing the protein of choice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Any suitable method of protein purification known to those of skill in the art can be used to purify the chimeric zinc finger proteins of the invention (see Ausubel, supra, Sambrook, supra). In addition, any suitable host can be used, e.g., bacterial cells, insect cells, yeast cells, mammalian cells, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, expression of the zinc finger protein fused to a maltose binding protein (MBP-zinc finger protein) in bacterial strain JM109 allows for straightforward purification through an amylose column (NEB). High expression levels of the chimeric zinc finger protein can be obtained by induction with IPTG since the MBP-zinc finger protein fusion in the pMal-c2 expression plasmid is under the control of the IPTG inducible tac promoter (NEB). Bacteria containing the MBP-zinc finger protein fusion plasmids are. inoculated in to 2&times;YT medium containing 10 &mgr;M ZnCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.02% glucose, plus 50 &mgr;g/ml ampicillin and shaken at 37&deg; C. At mid-exponential growth IPTG is added to 0.3 mM and the cultures are allowed to shake. After 3 hours the bacteria are harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by sonication, and then insoluble material is removed by centrifugation. The MBP-zinc finger protein proteins are captured on an amylose-bound resin, washed extensively with buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT and 50 &mgr;M ZnCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, then eluted with maltose in essentially the same buffer (purification is based on a standard protocol from NEB). Purified proteins are quantitated and stored for biochemical analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The biochemical properties of the purified proteins, e.g., K<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>, can be characterized by any suitable assay. In one embodiment, K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>is characterized via electrophoretic mobility shift assays (&ldquo;EMSA&rdquo;) (Buratowski &amp; Chodosh, in <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology </italic></highlight>pp. 12.2.1-12.2.7 (Ausubel ed., 1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> V. Regulatory Domains </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The chimeric zinc finger proteins made using the methods of the invention can optionally be associated with regulatory domains for modulation of gene expression. The chimeric zinc finger protein can be covalently or non-covalently associated with one or more regulatory domains, alternatively two or more regulatory domains, with the two or more domains being two copies of the same domain, or two different domains. The regulatory domains can be covalently linked to the chimeric zinc finger protein, e.g., via an amino acid linker, as part of a fusion protein. The zinc finger proteins can also be associated with a regulatory domain via a non-covalent dimerization domain, e.g., a leucine zipper, a STAT protein N terminal domain, or an FK506 binding protein (see, e.g., O&apos;Shea, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>254: 539 (1991), Barahmand-Pour et al., <highlight><italic>Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. </italic></highlight>211:121-128 (1996); Klemm et al., <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </italic></highlight>16:569-592 (1998); Klemm et al., <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </italic></highlight>16:569-592 (1998); Ho et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>382:822-826 (1996); and Pomeranz et al., <highlight><italic>Biochem. </italic></highlight>37:965 (1998)). The regulatory domain can be associated with the chimeric zinc finger protein at any suitable position, including the C- or N-terminus of the chimeric zinc finger protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Common regulatory domains for addition to the chimeric zinc finger protein made using the methods of the invention include, e.g., heterologous DNA binding domains from transcription factors, effector domains from transcription factors (activators, repressors, co-activators, co-repressors), silencers, nuclear hormone receptors, oncogene transcription factors (e.g., myc, jun, fos, myb, max, mad, rel, ets, bcl, myb, mos family members etc.); and chromatin associated proteins and their modifiers (e.g., kinases, acetylases and deacetylases). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Transcription factor polypeptides from which one can obtain a regulatory domain include those that are involved in regulated and basal transcription. Such polypeptides include transcription factors, their effector domains, coactivators, silencers, nuclear hormone receptors (see, e.g., Goodrich et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>84:825-30 (1996) for a review of proteins and nucleic acid elements involved in transcription; transcription factors in general are reviewed in Barnes &amp; Adcock, <highlight><italic>Clin. Exp. Allergy </italic></highlight>25 Suppl. 2:46-9 (1995) and Roeder, <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>273:165-71 (1996)).

<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Plasmid construction. Zinc finger expression plasmids used in transfection studies were constructed by PCR amplification of DNA segments encoding the desired fingers of the Zif268 peptide and/or the NRE peptide. These DNA segments were inserted into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pCS, which had been constructed by subcloning an oligonucleotide duplex 5&prime;-AGCTACCATGGCCAAGGAAACCGCAGCTGCCAAATTCGAAAGACAGCATATGGATTCTAAGCTTCGCGGATCCT-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 1) 5&prime;-CTAGAGGATCCGCGAAGCTTAGAATCCATATGCTGTCTTTCGAATTTGGCAGCTGCGGTTTCCTTGGCCATGGT-3&prime; ) (SEQ ID NO: 2) into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). These expression plasmids were designed to produce zinc finger peptides with both an S-peptide tag (Kim &amp; Raines, <highlight><italic>Protein Sci. </italic></highlight>2:348-356(1993); Kim &amp; Raines, i. 219:165-166 (1995)) and a nuclear localization signal from SV40 large T-antigen (Kalderon et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>39:499-509 (1984)) at their N-terminus. Reporter plasmid were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange&trade; kit (Stratagene). Construction of the template plasmid (pGL3-TATA/Inr) for the mutagenesis was described previously (Kim &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>J. Biol Chem. </italic></highlight>272:29795-29800 (1997)). The DNA sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Protein production and purification. The DNA segments encoding the Zif268, NRE, and 268//NRE peptides were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-6P-3 (Pharmacia). The zinc finger proteins were expressed in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>as fusions with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and were purified using affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol. These constructs did not have an S-peptide tag or an SV40 nuclear localization signal. GST was subsequently removed by digestion with PreScission&trade; Protease (Pharmacia). Protein concentrations were estimated by using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Pomerantz et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>267:93-96 (1995)). Concentrations of active zinc finger proteins were determined essentially as described (Rebar &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>263:671-673 (1994)). These two methods gave comparable results, indicating that almost all of the protein was active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Gel shift assay. DNA binding reactions contained the appropriate zinc finger peptide and binding site(s) in a solution of 20 mM bis-Tris propane pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 20 mM ZnSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 5 mM DTT, and 0.10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 10 mL. All binding experiments were performed at room temperature. The DNA sequences of the binding sites follow: N site, 5&prime;-TCTGC AAGGGTTCA GGCGACACCAACCAA-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 3); Z site, 5&prime;-GTGTGTGTGTGATCT GCGTGGGCG GTAAG-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 4); NZ site, 5&prime;-TCTGC AAGGGTTCA GCGTGGGCG GTAAG-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 5); N/Z site, 5&prime;-TCTGC AAGGGTTCA G GCGTGGGCG GTAAG-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 6); and N//Z site, 5&prime;-TCTGC AAGGGTTCA GT GCGTGGGCG GTAAG-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 7). In each case, the 9-bp recognition sequences are underlined. Labeled DNAs used in gel shift assays were prepared by Klenow extension or kinase reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> To determine dissociation constants, 3-fold serial dilutions of the Zif268 or NRE peptide were incubated with a labeled probe DNA (0.4-1.4 pM) at room temperature for 1 h, and then the reaction mixtures were subjected to gel electrophoresis. The radioactive signals were quantitated by phosphorimager analysis; apparent dissociation constants were determined as described (Rebar &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>263:671-673 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> On-rates and off-rates were also determined by gel shift assay. To initiate the binding reaction when determining on-rate constants, a labeled probe DNA (final concentration, &tilde;0.4 pM) was added to the zinc finger peptide (final concentration, 5-10 pM) at room temperature, and aliquots were analyzed by gel electrophoresis at various time points (0-20 min). The fraction bound at time t was determined by phosphorimager analysis of the gels. The data were then fit (KaleidaGraph&trade; program (Synergy Software)) to the equation:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> where &lsqb;P&rsqb; is the concentration of the zinc finger protein. Off-rate constants were determined essentially as described (Kim et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> USA 94:3616-3620 (1997)). Proteins (final concentration, 100 pM) were preincubated with a labeled probe DNA for 1 hour and then a large excess of unlabeled probe DNA (final concentration, 20 nM) was added. Aliquots were removed at various time points and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The fraction of labeled site was normalized to the fraction found at the end of the 1 hour preincubation period. The natural log of the normalized fraction bound was plotted against time, and the off-rate was determined from the slope. All data points for fast on-rate and off-rate measurements were corrected for the electrophoresis dead time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Competition binding studies. The 268//NRE peptide (final concentration, 5 pM) was first incubated for 1 hour with various amounts of a cold competitor DNA (0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, and 50 nM), and then the labeled N/Z site (6-8 pM) was added. Samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis after 2, 24, 48, 96, 190, and 600 hours. Specificity ratios (Kdc/Kd) were calculated from the equation:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> where K<highlight><subscript>dc </subscript></highlight>is the dissociation constant for binding to the competitor DNA; K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>is the dissociation constant for binding to the intact chimeric site; &lsqb;C&rsqb; is the concentration of competitor DNA; &lsqb;P&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>is the total-concentration of the protein; F<highlight><subscript>o </subscript></highlight>is the fraction bound in the absence of the competitor DNA; and F is the fraction bound in the presence of the competitor DNA. This equation assumes that the concentration of free protein is significantly smaller than that of protein bound to DNA. This criterion should readily be satisfied since the Kd of the 268//NRE peptide at the N/Z site is 3.8 fM, and 5 pM of the fusion peptide was used in these competition experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Competition experiments with salmon sperm DNA contained the 268//NRE or Zif268 peptide (200 pM), the labeled N/Z site, and a slight molar excess of unlabeled N/Z site. Various amounts of salmon sperm DNA were added, and samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis after 2, 24, and 48 hours incubation. When calculating specificity ratios, it was assumed that each base in the salmon sperm DNA represents the beginning of a potential (nonspecific) binding site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Transient cotransfection assay. The 293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with a glycerol shock as described (Cepek et al., <highlight><italic>Genes Dev. </italic></highlight>10:2079-2088 (1996)). Transfection experiments typically used cells at 10-30% confluency in monolayer cultures (6-well plates), and the following plasmids were added: 0.2 mg of the empty expression plasmid (pCS) or of expression plasmids encoding zinc finger peptides; 0.2 mg of a reporter plasmid; 1 mg of activator plasmid (GAL4-VP16); 0.1 mg of &bgr;-galactosidase expression plasmid (pCMVb; Clontech); and 2.5 mg of carrier plasmid (pUC19). The luciferase and &bgr;-galactosidase activities in the transfected cells were measured as described (Kim et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

All the zinc finger peptides expressed in 293 cells were quantitated by using the S.Tag&trade; Rapid Assay kit (Novagen) (Kim &amp; Raines, <highlight><italic>Protein Sci. </italic></highlight>2:348-356(1993); Kim &amp; Raines, <highlight><italic>Anal.

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Structure-based design of poly-zinc finger peptides. The design strategy involved linking two three-finger peptides, using longer (noncanonical) linkers at the junction to avoid introducing any strain. To further reduce any risk of interference or collision between the fingers, the linkers were designed so they could accommodate composite binding sites with one or two additional base pairs inserted between the individual 9-bp binding sites. Studies reported in this paper used the three-finger Zif268 peptide (which recognizes the site 5&prime;-GCG TGG GCG-3&prime;; SEQ ID NO: 8) and a three-finger &ldquo;NRE&rdquo; peptide (a Zif268 variant previously selected via phage display) that binds tightly and specifically to part of a nuclear hormone response element (5&prime;-AAG GGT TCA-3&prime;; SEQ ID NO: 9) (Greisman &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>275:657-661 (1997)). The composite target site with one additional base pair at the center has the sequence 5&prime;-AAG GGT TCA G GCG TGG GCG-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 10) and is called the N/Z site (N denotes the binding site for the NRE peptide and Z the binding site for Zif268). The site with two additional base pairs at the center has the sequence 5&prime;-AAG GGT TCA GT GCG TGG GCG-3&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 11) and is called the N//Z site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Structure-based design, with the Zif268 complex (Pavletich &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>252:809-817(1991); Elrod-Erickson et al., <highlight><italic>Structure </italic></highlight>4:1171-1180 (1996)) as a model, was used to determine the appropriate length of linkers for making poly-finger proteins that could recognize each binding site (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>). At the N/Z site, it appeared that having 8 residues between the Leu at the a-helical end of the first peptide and the Tyr residue at the first b-sheet of the next peptide would allow sufficient flexibility. A canonical &ldquo;TGEKP&rdquo; linker has 4 residues (i.e., Gly-Glu-Lys-Pro) in this region. At the N//Z site, it seemed reasonable to use 11 residues between the Leu and the Tyr (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). Each linker (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) contained sequences that naturally flank the N-terminus and C-terminus of the three-finger Zif268 peptide. To allow additional flexibility, a glycine was included in the shorter linker (which still is 4 residues longer than a canonical linker), and a Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser sequence was included in the longer linker (which is 7 residues longer than a canonical linker). Using a notation analogous to that for the binding sites, the fusion protein with the shorter linker is denoted as 268/NRE and the fusion protein with the longer linker is denoted as 268//NRE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Gel shift assays to determine dissociation constants and half lives of protein-DNA complexes. The Zif268, NRE, and 268//NRE zinc finger peptides were expressed and purified from <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, and used in several sets of gel shift experiments. A preliminary set of experiments was simply designed to determine whether two three-finger proteins could bind at adjacent 9-bp sites (any interference in binding of the unlinked peptides could reduce the affinity of a poly-finger protein for the composite sites). The first experiments used a DNA fragment (referred to as the NZ site) with the NRE- and Zif268-binding sites directly juxtaposed (5&prime;-AAG GGT TCA GCG TGG GCG-3&prime;; SEQ ID NO: 12). Various amounts of the NRE peptide were incubated with labeled NZ site in the presence or absence of Zif268 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). It was determined that the three-finger NRE peptide actually binds slightly more tightly to the NZ site with prebound Zif268 than to the free site. The apparent dissociation constant (K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>) of the NRE peptide is 180 pM when it binds alone but 60 pM when Zif268 is prebound to the neighboring site. Similar results were obtained at the N/Z site. These experiments prove that there is no collision between peptides bound at adjacent sites and suggest that there may even be some modest cooperative effect. It appears that previous limits in the affinity of poly-finger proteins (Rebar (Ph.D. Thesis), Selection Studies of Zinc Finger-DNA Recognition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1997); Shi, (Ph.D. Thesis), Molecular Mechanisms of Zinc Finger Protein-Nucleic Acid Interactions, Johns Hopkins University (1995); Liu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:5525-5530 (1997)) were due to problems with linker design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> A second set of binding studies confirms the efficacy of the new linker design. Equilibrium titrations show that the 268//NRE peptide has significantly higher affinity for the composite sites than for the individual 9-bp sites (Table 1). The fusion protein binds to the isolated 9-bp sites with K<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>s similar to those of the NRE peptide (180 pM) and the Zif268 peptide (14 pM) for their binding sites. In contrast, the 268//NRE fusion protein binds composite sites so tightly that dissociation constants are too small to readily be determined by protein titration. At least 0.4 pM of labeled probe DNA was needed in these gel shift experiments, making it difficult to accurately determine K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>values of &lt;1 pM. Given these technical difficulties, it was decided to measure the on-rate and off-rate for binding of the 268//NRE peptide and to use these rates to estimate the equilibrium binding constant (Table 1). Parallel studies with the three-finger peptides provided useful controls. On rates for the 268//NRE, NRE, and Zif268 peptides were fast and were close to the diffusion-controlled limit (108 to 109 M-1s-1) (von Hippel &amp; Berg, I.264:675-678 (1989)). The off rates showed amazing differences: The three-finger peptides have half-lives of &lt;39 seconds, whereas the 268//NRE peptide has a half-life of 370 hours at the NZ site. Control studies show that the 268//NRE peptide forms a much less stable complex with a single 9-bp site (thus the half-life&equals;150 seconds at the N site). Both the NRE fingers and the Zif268 fingers must bind their respective 9-bp subsites to form the extraordinarily stable complex observed with the 268//NRE peptide at the NZ site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In all cases where parallel measurements could be performed, K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>values calculated from the ratio of kinetic constants (k<highlight><subscript>off</subscript></highlight>/k<highlight><subscript>on</subscript></highlight>) were in good agreement with those determined from equilibrium studies (Table 1). This gave confidence in using the kinetic data to determine K<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>s in cases where direct titration was impracticable. Calculations show that the 268//NRE peptide has femtomolar affinity for the composite binding sites, with a K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>of 2.1&times;10-15 M (2.1 fM) at the NZ site, 3.7 fM at the N/Z site, and 3.0 fM at the N//Z site (the consistency of these three K<highlight><subscript>d</subscript></highlight>s also is encouraging since it would be expected that the longer, flexible linker should readily accommodate any of these spacings). The data show that the new linker design is quite effective: the 268//NRE fusion peptide binds far more tightly (5,000-95,000 fold) to the composite site than to the individual 9-bp sites, and it binds far more tightly (6,000-90,000 fold) than either of the original three-finger peptides.

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Competition experiments were also used to further study the affinity and specificity of the six-finger 268//NRE peptide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>). One set of experiments directly tested how well the 9-bp N and Z sites could compete with the composite N/Z site for binding to the fusion peptide. In these experiments, various amounts of cold N or Z site were mixed with a limiting amount of the 268//NRE peptide. After 1 hour of incubation, a slightly molar excess (relative to the total amount of fusion protein) of labeled N/Z site was added. Under these conditions, about 70% of the labeled DNA is shifted in the absence of competitor DNA. Samples taken at various time points were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Since the 268//NRE peptide concentration in this experiment (5 pM) is a few orders of magnitude higher than the peptide&apos;s dissociation constant for the N/Z site, almost all the peptide binds to the N/Z site when no competitor DNA is added. Any decrease in the amount of shifted N/Z site in the presence of competitor DNA reflects binding of the 268//NRE peptide to the competing site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Equilibration in these experiments requires hundreds of hours, and the stability of the purified protein actually becomes a significant concern (the composite site is added last, and equilibration takes a long time since the fusion protein may encounter cold Z sites hundreds or thousands of times before it first encounters a labeled N/Z site). After pre-equilibration with high concentrations of cold N or Z site, it was determined that the fraction of N/Z label shifted increases steadily with increasing incubation times of up to about 600 hours. After 600 hour of incubation, a significant fraction of the labeled N/Z site is shifted even in the presence of a 10,000-fold molar excess of cold N or Z site. Specificity ratios (calculated as described above) indicate that the 268//NRE peptide prefers the composite site over the N site by a factor of at least 3,800&plus;1,600 and that the fusion peptide prefers the composite site over the Z site by a factor of at least 320&plus;44. These experiments directly confirm the remarkable specificity of the six-finger peptide, but these values are only lower bounds on the specificity ratios. The protein sample loses some activity during the long incubation time required by these experiments (the activity of the free protein has a half-life of about 2 days under these conditions), and denatured protein will never have a chance to shift the labeled N/Z site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Competition experiments with salmon sperm DNA were used to estimate the ratio of specific/nonspecific binding constants for the 268//NRE peptide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). These experiments showed that the 268//NRE peptide discriminates very effectively against nonspecific DNA and indicate a specificity ratio (K<highlight><subscript>dns</subscript></highlight>/K<highlight><subscript>d </subscript></highlight>) of 8.8&plus;1.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>. Parallel experiments with the three-finger Zif268 peptide give a specificity ratio of 1.2&plus;0.1&times;10<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>. Previous studies, using calf thymus DNA as a competitor and slightly different conditions, had given a specificity ratio of 0.31&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>for the Zif268 peptide (Greisman &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>275:657-661 (1997)). Taken together, data on the affinity and specificity of the six-finger 268//NRE fusion peptide suggested that it might serve as a very effective repressor and certainly indicated that it would be an excellent candidate for further analysis in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Transient cotransfection studies in the 293 human cell line were used to see whether the new poly-finger peptides could effectively repress transcription from reporter genes. In a previous study, it had been shown that the Zif268 peptide could efficiently repress both basal and VP16-activated transcription when the Zif268 peptide bound to a site near the TATA box or the initiator element (Kim &amp; Pabo, <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>272:29795-29800 (1997)). In this current study, a luciferase reporter and similar promoter constructs were used in which appropriate binding sites (Z, N, N/Z, and N//Z) were incorporated at comparable positions near the initiator element (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> It was determined that the 268//NRE peptide gives 72-fold repression of VP16-activated transcription at a promoter containing the N/Z site and 47-fold repression at a promoter containing the N//Z site (FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D). The 268/NRE peptide gives 68-fold repression at the N/Z site. Clearly, these fusion peptides are very effective repressors at sites with the appropriate spacings. Parallel experiments with the three-finger peptides show repression but indicate that they are considerably less effective than the fusion peptides. Thus the NRE peptide gives 1.9-fold repression with an N site in the promoter; 1.8-fold repression with an N/Z site; 2.7-fold repression with an N//Z site; and no repression with an isolated Z site. The Zif268 peptide gives 13-fold repression from the Z promoter; 8.9-fold repression from the N/Z promoter; 15-fold repression from the N//Z promoter; and no repression with an isolated N site. Further experiments prove that covalent coupling is needed to achieve the much higher repression levels obtained with the fusion proteins at the N/Z site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Thus co-expressing the Zif268 and NRE peptides as separate polypeptide chains (by including both expression plasmids in the cotransfection assays) gives only 8.5-fold repression at the N/Z site, a level comparable (within experimental error) to the 8.9-fold repression obtained at this site with the isolated Zif268 peptide. This is far less than the 68-fold and 72-fold repression that the 268/NRE and 268//NRE fusion proteins give at the N/Z site, and it is clear that these &ldquo;synergistic&rdquo; effects require covalent linkage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the additional fingers in the fusion peptides may have some modest repressive effects even in cases where only three of the fingers can bind specifically. Thus the six-finger peptides (268/NRE and 268//NRE) give 21 to 23-fold repression from the Z promoter. A similar (22-fold) repression level is obtained with the 268/NRE peptide at the N//Z site. Modeling suggests that the linker is too short to allow specific binding of all six fingers at this site. These repression levels are consistently somewhat higher than the level observed with the isolated Zif268 peptide at the Z site (13-fold repression). It seems possible (when the 268//NRE peptide binds to the Z site) that 1) the NRE fingers are free and yet sterically interfere with assembly of the transcription complex or that 2) the NRE fingers make weak nonspecific contacts with the DNA and thus slightly enhance the stability of the complex. Further studies indicate that all peptides are expressed at comparable levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The zinc finger peptides expressed in 293 cells had an S-peptide tag, and the amount of peptide was quantitated by using a ribonuclease assay after activating with S-protein (Kim &amp; Raines, <highlight><italic>Protein Sci. </italic></highlight>2:348-356(1993); Kim &amp; Raines, <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>219:165-166 (1995)). A conservative estimate indicates that the expression levels of the peptides in cells are significantly higher (at least 100 fold) than the dissociation constants of the three-finger peptides. Plasmids that would encode four- and five-finger variants of the 268/NRE and 268//NRE peptides were also constructed. These were tested in tissue culture transfection studies, and they typically gave repression levels intermediate between those obtained with the three-finger peptides and those obtained with the six-finger peptides (FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>D). </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">INTRODUCTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is concerned with modulating the drug resistance pathways of cells in order to either confer or overcome resistance to certain drug molecules. Such modulation entails modulation of an extra-cellular phosphatase (ecto-phosphatase) and an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter in order to achieve the desired effect on drug resistance. Stimulation of the ecto-phosphatase either alone or together with stimulation of the ABC transporter yields an increased resistance to drug molecules while inhibition of the ecto-phosphatase alone or together with the ABC transporter yields reduced resistance to the drug molecule. Drug resistance is achieved through the altering of the ATP gradient across biological membranes which is effectuated through the modulation of an ecto-phosphatase either alone or together with an ABC transporter molecule. Modulation of drug resistance as described herein is useful in conferring herbicide resistance to plants; conferring drug resistance to microorganisms and tissue culture cells; reducing drug resistance in tumor cells for improved chemotherapy applications; and reducing resistance to antibiotics, antifungal agents, and other drugs in microorganisms for the treatment of infections and disease. The present invention is also directed to methods for identifying inhibitors of ecto-phosphatases and uses thereof. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Transport Processes </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Cells can use a phenomenon called symport to move soluble products across biological membranes. Symport is a form of coupled movement of two solutes in the same direction across a membrane by a single carrier. Examples of proton and sodium-linked symport systems are found in nearly all living systems. The energetics of the transport event depend on the relative size and electrical nature of the gradient of solutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Transport processes have been classified on the basis of their energy-coupling mechanisms. Currently there are four classifications: (1) Primary Active Transport which uses either a chemical, light or electrical energy source, (2) Group Translocation which uses chemical energy sources, (3) Secondary Active Transport which uses either a sodium or proton electrochemical gradient energy source, and (4) Facilitated Diffusion which does not require an energy source. Meyers, R. A., 1997<highlight><italic>, Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine </italic></highlight>6:125-133. The present invention is related to transport molecules belonging to the first class of transport processes, primary active transport, and therefore, this type of transport will be discussed in further detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Primary active transport refers to a process whereby a &ldquo;primary&rdquo; source of energy is used to drive the active accumulation of a solute into or extrusion of a solute from a cell. Transport proteins include P-type ATPases and ABC-type ATPases. These types of transport systems are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The bacterial ABC-type transporters, which are ATP-driven solute pumps, have eukaryotic counterparts. Additionally, many transmembrane solute transport proteins exhibit a common structural motif. The proteins in these families consist of units or domains that pass through the membrane six times, each time as an a-helix. This has led to the suggestion that many transport proteins share a common evolutionary origin, but this is not true of several distinct families of transport proteins. Numerous structurally distinct bacterial permeases, as well as several homologous eukaryotic transport systems, share a common organization. Meyers, R. A., 1997<highlight><italic>, Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine </italic></highlight>6:125-133. Two hydrophilic domains or proteins function to couple ATP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm to activate substrate uptake or efflux, and two hydrophobic domains or proteins function as the transmembrane substrate channels. These proteins or protein domains constitute what is referred to as the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) superfamily. Either the two hydrophilic domains or proteins or the two hydrophobic domains or proteins (or both) may exist either as heterodimers or homodimers. If, as in most bacterial systems, each of these constituents is a distinct protein, then either two, three, or four genes will code for them, depending on whether both are homodimers, one is a homodimer and one is a heterodimer, or both are heterodimers, respectively. The best characterized of the eukaryotic proteins included in this family are the multidrug-resistance (MDR) transporter and the cystic fibrosis related chloride ion channel of mammalian cells (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or CFTR).

<heading lvl="1">Multidrug Resistance </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a general term that refers to the phenotype of cells or microorganisms that exhibit resistance to different, chemically dissimilar, cytotoxic compounds. MDR can develop after sequential or simultaneous exposure to various drugs. MDR can also develop before exposure to many compounds to which a cell or microorganism may be found to be resistant. MDR which develops before exposure is frequently due to a genetic event which causes the altered expression and/or mutation of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Wadkins, R. M. and Roepe, P. D., 1997<highlight><italic>, International Review of Cytology </italic></highlight>171:121-165. This is true for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Id. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One prominent member of the ABC family, P-glycoprotein (Pgp; also known as multidrug resistance protein or MDR1), which is a plasma-membrane glycoprotein that confers a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype on cells, is of considerable interest because it provides one mechanism of possibly inhibiting resistance in tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Senior, A E. et al., 1995<highlight><italic>, FEBS Letters </italic></highlight>377:285-289. Pgp is a single polypeptide of &tilde;1280 amino acids with the typical ABC transporter structure profile. Studies have shown that over-expression of Pgp is responsible for the ATP-dependent extrusion of a variety of compounds, including chemotherapeutic drugs, from cells. Abraham, E. H. et al., 1993<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90:312-316. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Over one-hundred ABC transporters have been identified in species ranging from <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>to humans. Higgins C. F., 1995<highlight><italic>, Cell </italic></highlight>82:693-696. For example, the bacteria <highlight><italic>Lactococcus lactis </italic></highlight>expresses an ABC transporter, LmrA, which mediates antibiotic resistance by extruding amphiphilic compounds from the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. van Veen H. W. et al., 1998<highlight><italic>, Nature </italic></highlight>391:291-295. Furthermore, over-expression of LmrA can confer MDR in human lung fibroblasts and LmrA has similar molecular and biochemical properties to Pgp. Id. This demonstrates that bacterial LmrA and Pgp are functionally interchangeable. Id. Additionally, the plant <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>encodes an ATP transporter, AtPGP-1, which is a putative Pgp homolog. Dudler, R. and Hertig, C., 1992<highlight><italic>, Journal of Biological Chemistry </italic></highlight>267:5882-5888. Similarly, the yeast <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>equivalent of Pgp, STS1 (Bissinger, P. H and Kucher, K., 1994<highlight><italic>, J Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>269:4180-4186), has been cloned and shown to confer multidrug resistance when over-expressed in yeast, as has the yeast Pdr5p (Kolacskowski et al., 1996<highlight><italic>, J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>271:31543-31548). Taken together, these results suggest that this type of multidrug resistance efflux pump is conserved from bacteria to humans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> While various theories of ABC transporter function have become popular, there is still no precise molecular-level description for the mechanism by which over-expression lowers intracellular accumulation of drugs, in particular how Pgp lowers intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, it has been shown that Pgp over-expression also changes plasma membrane electrical potential and intracellular pH which could potentially greatly affect the cellular flux of a large number of compounds to which Pgp confers resistance. Randy M. Wadkins and Paul D. Roepe, 1997<highlight><italic>, International Review of Cytology </italic></highlight>171:121-165. Also included in the ABC transporter superfamily are the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) and the Sulfonyl Urea Receptor (SUR). CFTR and SUR are expressed in the lung epithelium and the &bgr; cells of the pancreas, respectively, as well as in other tissues. CFTR functions as a low conductance ATP and cyclic AMP-dependent Cl<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> channel that also appears to have additional important functions, such as modulation of epithelial Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> conductance and regulation of outwardly rectified chloride channels. Wadkins, R. M. and Roepe, P. D., 1997<highlight><italic>, International Review of Cytology </italic></highlight>171:121-165. Mutations in the CFTR gene produce altered CFTR proteins with defects in CFTR function, leading to profound alterations in epithelial salt transport and altered mucous properties in cystic fibrosis patients that result in chronic lung infections associated with the disease. Id. SUR is triggered by sulfonyl urea drugs to depolarize pancreatic &bgr; cells that leads to Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> influx, which stimulates fusion of insulin-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. Id. An ATP transporter hypothesis has been suggested for Pgp, CFTR and SUR which theorizes that these ABC transporters function as ATP transport channels. Abraham, E. H. et al, 1993<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90:312-316; Schweibert, E. M., 1995<highlight><italic>, Cell </italic></highlight>81:1063-1073; and Al-Awqati, Q., 1995<highlight><italic>, Science </italic></highlight>269:805-806. The ATP channel hypothesis, however, has been viewed with skepticism. This is partly due to the inability to show the same results with preparations including purified and reconstituted CFTR, suggesting that the ATP conductance that was originally observed may have been mediated by another protein, not present in the purified system, that is influenced by CFTR. Wadkins, R. M. and Roepe, P. D., 1997<highlight><italic>, International Review of Cytology </italic></highlight>171: 121-165. There has been no such negative data reported with respect to the ATP channel hypothesis for Pgp or SUR, but the controversy over CFTR has raised doubt for Pgp and SUR as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In support of the ATP channel hypothesis, Huang et al. (<highlight><italic>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </italic></highlight>182:836-843 (1992)) have suggested that extracellular ATP leads to elevations in pH, and Weiner et al. (<highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>261:4529-4534 (1986)) have suggested that extracellular ATP may regulate Na<highlight><subscript>&minus;</subscript></highlight>/H<highlight><subscript>&plus;</subscript></highlight> exchange in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. It has also been observed that changes in Pgp levels affects pH and plasma membrane electrical potentials which could be connected to recent observations suggesting the involvement of ATP transport in MDR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Additionally, Abraham et al. (<highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90:312-316 (1993)) have reported that the addition of extracellular ATP to MDR cell lines confers sensitivity to drugs abolishing MDR. The data for this effect were not presented in the article and no further explanation was given for this phenomenon. Furthermore, there have been no subsequent publications addressing or explaining this effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, Ujhazy et al. (<highlight><italic>Int. J. Cancer </italic></highlight>68:493-500 (1996)) have shown that ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase is up-regulated in certain MDR cell lines. Ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase is the final enzyme in the extracellular pathway for salvage of adenosine from phosphorylated purines. Zimmerman H., 1992<highlight><italic>, Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>285:345-365. The proposed hypothesis for the involvement of ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase in drug resistance considers its role in the maintenance of intracellular ATP pools through the adenosine salvage pathway. Ujhazy et al., 1996<highlight><italic>, Int. J. Cancer </italic></highlight>68:493-500. Ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase specifically acts in adenosine salvage pathways, converting AMP to adenosine which is more readily taken up by the cell and utilized as a precursor for ATP production. Therefore, ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase may be acting in certain MDR cell lines as a mechanism by which the cell circumvents the loss of ATP (due to up-regulated transport proteins which possibly form ATP transport channels) by creating higher levels of adenosine from which the cell can produce ATP. Correspondingly, 63% of MDR cell line variants tested expressed ecto-5&prime;- nucleotidase. These observations suggested that a salvage mechanism for extracellular nucleotides may be another way by which certain MDR cells counterbalance their ATP losses from efflux induced by the over-expression of ABC transporters involved in MDR. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibitors of ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase conferred sensitivity to certain drugs in MDR cell lines which over-express the ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is also interesting to note that yeast, which do not have an adenosine salvage pathway (Boyum, R. and Guidotti, G., 1997<highlight><italic>, Microbiology </italic></highlight>143:1901-1908), do contain a Pgp-like gene called STS1 (Bissinger, P. H. and Kucher, K., 1994<highlight><italic>, J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>269:4180-4186. Therefore, since the adenosine salvage pathway is unlikely to be involved in yeast multidrug resistance, other mechanisms are likely to exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Recent reports have confirmed the existence of ATP in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of both multicellular organisms and unicellular organisms. Sedaa, K. et al., 1990<highlight><italic>, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. </italic></highlight>252:1060-1067 and Boyum, R. and Guidotti, G., 1997<highlight><italic>, Microbiology </italic></highlight>143:1901-1908, respectively. However, no such reports are available which suggest the existence of ATP in the ECM of plants before the present invention. These reports have prompted further investigations of the fate of ATP outside the cell. One of the largest gradients in biological systems is that of ATP. It is a million-fold more concentrated inside the cell than outside. Apyrases are enzymes whose unifying characteristic is their ability to hydrolyze the gamma phosphate of ATP and to a lesser extent, the beta phosphate of ADP. Plesner, L., 1995<highlight><italic>, Int. Rev. Cyto. </italic></highlight>158:141-214. Most apyrases are expressed as plasma membrane associated proteins with their hydrolytic activity facing into the ECM. Wang, T. and Guidotti, G., 1996<highlight><italic>, J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>271:9898-9901. Extracellular apyrases are generally referred to as ecto-apyrases. Given reports that show the existence of extracellular ATP, one observation regarding ecto-apyrase is that it hydrolyzes the extracellular ATP. In fact, work in animal systems has shown that apyrases hydrolyze ATP in the ECM as part of the adenosine salvage pathway con-jointly with ecto-5&prime; ectonucleotidase. Che, M., 1992<highlight><italic>, J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>267:9684-9688. The existence of a similar ecto-apyrase system has not been reported in plants prior to the present invention. Additionally, ecto-apyrases have not been shown, prior to the present invention, to have a role in MDR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While some references appear to indicate that MDR may act at the level of ATP transport, the role of ATP in MDR has not been adequately elucidated and has remained a point of contention in the field. The present invention provides insight into the role of ATP transport in MDR by showing that the extracellular ATP pool in cells is critical in MDR. While the adenosine salvage pathway may help compensate for ATP losses in MDR by providing a mechanism to recoup adenosine, it is not the critical aspect of the role of ATP in MDR as evidenced by the observation that only a subset of MDR cell lines resort to this mechanism via the up-regulation of ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase to maintain drug resistance. In fact, the previous data teach away from modulating extracelluar ATP levels and place the focus on mechanisms which are involved in modulating intracellular ATP levels. Since AMP is the preferred substrate for ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase, with ATP and ADP being poor substrates (Zimmerman, H., 1992<highlight><italic>, Biochem. J. </italic></highlight>285:345-365), it is unlikely that ecto-5&prime;-nucleotidase is involved in modulating extracellular levels of ATP. While high levels of ATP have been demonstrated to be useful in the inhibition of tumor growth, its effects on tumor cells have been shown to prevent cell growth and induce cell death through the inhibition of the S phase of the cell cycle. U.S. Pat. No. 4,880,918. There has been no implication, prior to the present invention, of the importance of modulating extracellular ATP levels in MDR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Additionally, there has been no identification of specific inhibitors of apyrase (an ecto-phosphatase). Such inhibitors and methods for identifying such inhibitors would be useful for studying the importance of ecto-phosphatases in MDR, for modulating MDR and in industrial applications (e.g. determining the titer of microbia in soil). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It would be particularly useful to have more effective mechanisms by which to modulate drug resistance in various organisms. In particular, since the use of Pgp inhibitors has not been totally efficient in overcoming the resistance seen in tumor cells which have been repeatedly exposed to chemotherapeutic agents, it would be useful to have other mechanisms by which to combat such resistance in tumor cells to provide more effective chemotherapeutic treatments. Furthermore, there are many other applications for the modulation of drug resistance which are contemplated by the present invention, such as the engineering of herbicide resistant plants for use in agriculture. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method for the modulation of drug resistance in cells. In one embodiment, resistance is conferred through over-expression by genetic manipulation of ABC transporters and ecto-phosphatases which are capable of affecting extracellular ATP pools and thus affecting the ATP gradient across biological membranes. Conference of resistance is useful to achieve herbicide resistance in plants, drug resistance in yeast (i.e. resistance to anti-fungal agents) in biotechnology applications, antibiotic resistance in bacteria in biotechnology applications and for drug resistance in eukaryotic tissue culture cells in biotechnology applications. In another embodiment, loss of drug resistance is achieved by suppressing the breakdown of extracellular ATP through the down-regulation of ecto-phosphatases in the presence or absence of the down-regulation of ABC transporters. Loss of resistance is useful to mitigate drug resistance problems associated with chemotherapy and in the treatment of infections from resistant strains of microorganisms. The modulation of drug resistance is achieved, at least in part, by altering the ATP gradient across biological membranes through the aforementioned manipulation of ABC transporters and ecto-phosphatases. The present invention is also directed to methods for the identification of inhibitors of ecto-phosphatases and uses thereof.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Conference of Herbicide Resistance in Plants </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method for the modulation of drug resistance in plants, particularly herbicide resistance, in part through the manipulation of the ATP gradient across biological membranes. In accordance with the invention, the manipulation of extracellular ATP levels and hence the ATP gradient across biological membranes in plant cells by the over-expression of a MDR-ABC transporter and an ecto-phosphatase, results in resistance to certain plant hormones, drugs and herbicides. Such resistance is useful in horticulture of recombinant crops for the elimination of other unwanted plants (e.g. weeds) which are not resistant. The invention is based, in part, on the unexpected observation that the over-expression of either an ecto-phosphatase, or an ABC transporter can confer resistance to certain drugs and herbicides in plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Up-regulation as used herein refers to increasing the activity of a molecule within a cell by either providing an outside source of the molecule (e.g. an expression cassette containing a DNA encoding the molecule) either in single copy or multiple copies which when expressed in the cell increases the amount of the molecule in the cell, by increasing the transcription of the endogenous or exogenous molecule to increase the amount of the molecule in the cell, or by modifying the exogenous or endogenous molecule in the cell post-translationally to achieve an increase in activity of the molecule. Down-regulation as used herein refers to decreasing the activity of a molecule in a cell by either decreasing the amount of the molecule in the cell (this may be achieved by over-expression of an anti-sense RNA corresponding to the molecule or by inhibiting factors necessary for the expression of the molecule) or by modifying the exogenous or endogenous molecule in the cell post-translationally to achieve a decrease in activity. Such post translational modifications may include phosphorylation, adenylation, glycosylation, ubiquitinylation, acetylation, methylation, famesylation, myristilation and sulfation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The ecto-phosphatases remove phosphate from any ATP extruded from the cell, rendering the ATP ineffectual for transport of drugs back into the cell. Ecto-phosphatases as referred to herein do not include extracellular phosphatases involved in the adenosine salvage pathway. MDR ABC transporters form channels which facilitate the efflux of molecules, including drugs, from cells. This efflux is likely effectuated through the &ldquo;piggy-back&rdquo; efflux of drug molecules with ATP, a phenomenon known as symport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the over-expression of an ecto-phosphatase confers drug resistance in both wild-type and/or genetically engineered plants. This effect is seen in plant cells over-expressing plant apyrase grown in the presence of (1) cycloheximide, a potent inhibitor of protein expression, (2) nigericin, an antibiotic which effects ion transport, and (3) N<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(2-isopentenyl) adenine, a cytokinin plant hormone which is herbicidal at micromolar and millimolar concentrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the over-expression of an ABC transporter confers drug resistance in wild-type and genetically engineered plants. In a preferred embodiment, the ABC transporter which is over-expressed is the Arabidopsis ABC transporter AtPGP-1. The over-expression of AtPGP-1 can confer resistance in plants to cycloheximide, nigericin and cytokinins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the invention the effect of over-expression of both an MDR-ABC transporter and an ecto-phosphatase is enhancement of the ATP gradient across biological membranes and thus stimulation of resistance to certain plant hormones and herbicides. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the MDR-ABC transporter which is over-expressed is the Arabidopsis AtPGP-1 and the ecto-phosphatase that is over-expressed is apyrase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The invention particularly contemplates the conference of resistance in plants to herbicides which resemble established drugs implicated in multidrug resistance, as well as plant hormones such as cytokinin, auxins, gibberellins and brassinosteroids. The present invention also contemplates the conference of resistance in plants to the nonlimiting list of chemicals, such as those set forth in Table 1*.

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Also within the scope of the present invention is the stimulation of the activity of an ecto-phosphatase and an ABC transporter by the over-expression of a regulatory molecule which may act by up-regulating the expression levels or by post-translationally modifying the ecto-phosphatase and the ABC transporter. Such activating regulatory molecules (e.g. calmodulin) may be over-expressed alone or together with the over-expression of the ecto-apyrase and the ABC transporter or any other combination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Particular embodiments of the invention include polynucleotides that encode MDR-ABC transporter polypeptides, ecto-phosphatase polypeptides, and stimulatory regulatory polypeptides which are capable of stimulating the efflux of drug molecules from the cells, thus conferring drug resistance. The term polynucleotide encompasses nucleic acid molecules that encode a complete protein, as well as nucleic acid molecules that encode peptides, polypeptides, or fragments of a complete protein. The polynucleotides may comprise the wild-type allele (or a portion of such an allele) of a functional peptide ABC transporter and ecto-phosphatase, or they may comprise a mutated allele of such genes. The preferred polynucleotides encode the wild-type plant, <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></highlight>, AtPGP-1 ABC transporter (GenBank accession &num; X61370); wild-type <highlight><italic>Homo sapiens </italic></highlight>Pgp ABC transporter (GenBank accession &num; M29432); wild-type Homo sapiens MRP-&bgr; ABC transporter (PCT WO 98/46736); wild-type yeast, <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, </italic></highlight>transporter STS1 (GenBank accession &num; X75916); wild-type yeast, <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, </italic></highlight>transporter Pdr5p (GenBank accession &num; 1420383); wild-type <highlight><italic>Aspergillus fumigatus </italic></highlight>Afu-MDR1 ABC transporter (U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the polynucleotides are operably linked to regulatory sequences sufficient to permit the expression of the polynucleotide in a host cell. Such polynucleotides may be incorporated into nucleic acid vectors that are sufficient to permit either the propagation or maintenance of the polynucleotide within a host cell, and expression therein. The nature of the regulatory elements will depend upon the host cell, and the desired manner of expressing the polynucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The invention particularly contemplates providing the polynucleotides to plants. Suitable plants include, but are not limited to, species from the genera Fragaria, Lotus, Medicago, Onobrychis, Trifolium, Trigonella, Vigna, Citrus, Linum, Geranium, Manihot, Daucus, Arabidopsis, Brassica, Raphanus, Sinapis, Atropa, Capsicum, Datura, Hyoscyamus, Lycopersicon, Nicotiana, Helianthus, Lactuca, Bromus, Asparagus, Antirrhinum, Hemerocallis, Nemesia, Pelargonium, Panicum, Pennisetum, Ranunculus, Senecio, Salpiglossis, Cucumis, Bromelia, Glycine, Lolium, Zea, Triticum, Sorghum, Ipomoea, Passiflora, Cyclamen, Malus, Prunus, Rosa, Rubus, Populus, Santalum, Allium, Lilium, Narcissus, Ananas, Arachis, Phaseolus, Pisum, Oryza, Hordeum, Gossypium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Preferred prokaryotic vectors for subcloning and production of DNA include plasmids such as those capable of replication in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>such as, for example, pBR322, ColE1, psC101, pACYC184, such as those disclosed by Maniatis, T., et al.

(1982)); pET11a, pET3a, pET11d, pET3d, pET22d, pET12a, pET28a, and other pET variants (Novagen); pCDNA3, pCDNA1 (In Vitrogen). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods may be used to introduce the polynucleotides of the present invention into a plant cell. Some examples include, but are not limited to, microinjection directly into the plant embryo cells or introduced by electroporation as described in Fromm et al., 1985<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>82:5824-5828; direct precipitation using polyethylene glycol as described in Paszkowski et al., 1984<highlight><italic>, EMBO J. </italic></highlight>3:2717-2722; in the case of monocotyledonous plants, transformation of pollen with total DNA or an appropriate functional clone and the pollen can then be used to produce progeny by sexual reproduction; introduction of polynucleotides with the Ti plasmid of <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>which provides a means for introducing DNA into plant cells (Horsch et al., 1988<highlight><italic>, Current Communications in Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., pp 13-19); introduction of polynucleotides with the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) (U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A particularly useful Ti plasmid-based vector is Pky1x71. Schardl, C. et al., 1987<highlight><italic>, Gene </italic></highlight>61:1-11. This vector utilizes the natural transfer properties of the Ti plasmid. A cloning vehicle such as pKYLX71 allows the insertion of a polynucleotide sequence into the expression cassette by a single recombination event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The introduction of the transferred DNA (T-DNA) of the plasmid is accomplished by infecting root calli from Ws ecotype <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>with <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>under kanamycin selection. The calli are then developed further into plants. Valvekens, D., 1992<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85:5536-5540. Alternatively, shoot explants may be infected with the <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>bacteria. Under appropriate conditions, a ring of calli forms around the cut surface which is then transferred to growth medium, allowed to form shoots, roots and develop further into plants. Hooykass, P. J. J. et al., In: <highlight><italic>Molecular Form and Function of the Plant Genome, </italic></highlight>Plenum Press, N.Y. pp 655-667 (1984). Another alternative is to produce transformed plants using free DNA delivery. All plants from which protoplasts can be isolated and cultured to give whole regenerated plants can be transformed by the present invention so that whole plants are recovered which contain the introduced polynucleotide. Methods for generating plants from cultured protoplasts are described by Binding, H.

<heading lvl="1">Conference of Drug Resistance in Microorganisms </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also directed to a method for the conference of drug resistance to microorganisms, including yeast and bacteria in part through the manipulation of the ATP gradient across biological membranes. In yeast and bacteria, the manipulation of extracellular ATP levels and the ATP gradient across biological membranes by the over-expression of a MDR-ABC transporter and/or an ecto-phosphatase may result in resistance to certain drugs. Such resistance is useful for the growth of microorganisms for biotechnological applications, e.g., those used in heterologous protein production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is particularly advantageous to be able to produce microorganisms which are resistant to a variety of drugs for large scale fermentation procedures where contamination by microorganisms from the environment may threaten a costly procedure. Additionally, the present invention is useful to create resistant microorganism strains in small scale fermentation processes, industrial applications, as well as in selection systems for the production of recombinant microorganisms for research applications. Research applications may include the use of resistant microorganism strains to study alternative pathways, other than antibiotics, antifungal reagents, or other commonly used drugs which could effectively inhibit the growth of microorganisms involved in disease states of humans and animals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In yeast, a system which could confer drug resistance may be preferred to current research techniques which utilize yeast strains deficient for certain amino acid production pathways. These deficient yeast are used to introduce foreign nucleic acids of interest having a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein or proteins capable of resurrecting a deficient amino acid production pathway. Selection occurs when the yeast is grown in media deficient in that particular amino acid. This method of conferring resistance to yeast may be costly, however, since this requires that the yeast be grown in expensive cocktails of the amino acids in which they are deficient. In certain embodiments of the present invention, a cloning system in yeast confers drug resistance to the yeast coupled to the introduction of a nucleic acid molecule of interest. Such resistance may be constitutive or inducible. The yeast may then be selected by the introduction of inexpensive drugs to which the recombinant yeast would be resistant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments of the invention, bacteria may be produced with increased resistance to certain drugs in order to facilitate the production and to provide a system which allows for selection of bacteria based on another mechanism other than antibiotic resistance. Such resistance may be constitutive or inducible and may be particularly useful in large scale fermentation where contamination by other microorganisms is more likely to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Also contemplated by the present invention is the development of microorganisms which grow in soil (soil flora), particularly those designed to interact with herbicide resistant plants. The soil flora may be engineered with the same resistance to toxins as the plants with which they are engineered to react. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the invention is directed to the development of microorganisms which are resistant to multiple toxins (two-stage resistant microorganisms or multiple-stage resistant microorganisms). The toxins could be presented to such two-stage resistant organisms or multiple-stage microorganisms simultaneously or at independent times. The present invention also contemplates the development of two-stage or multiple-stage resistant plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the over-expression of an ecto-phosphatase confers drug resistance in wild-type or genetically engineered microorganisms. This effect was seen in yeast cells over-expressing plant apyrase grown in the presence of cycloheximide, a potent inhibitor of protein expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the over-expression of an ABC transporter confers drug resistance in wild-type and genetically engineered microorganisms. In a preferred embodiment, the ABC transporter which is over-expressed is the <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>ABC transporter AtPGP-1. This ABC transporter was able to confer resistance to yeast cells grown in the presence of cycloheximide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of the invention the affect of over-expression of both an MDR-ABC transporter and an ecto-phosphatase is to enhance the ATP gradient across biological membranes and thus stimulate the resistance to certain antimicrobial agents. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the MDR-ABC transporter which is over-expressed is the <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>AtPGP-1 and the ecto-phosphatase that is over-expressed is <highlight><italic>Pisum sativum </italic></highlight>apyrase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The invention particularly contemplates, but is not limited to, the conference of resistance in microorganisms to cycloheximide, antibiotics, antifungal agents, pheromones, heavy metals, flourescent dyes, DNA intercalating agents, products of plant secondary metabolism such as polyphenolics and alkaloids, plant growth substances with antimicrobial properties, and the chemicals listed in Table 1 above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids are operably linked to regulatory sequences sufficient to permit the transcription of the nucleic acid in the microorganism of interest. Such constructs may be incorporated into nucleic acid vectors that are sufficient to permit either the propagation or maintenance of the nucleic acid and expression thereof within the host cell. The nature of the regulatory elements is dependent upon the host cell, and the desired manner of expressing the nucleic acid (e.g. constitutively or inducibly). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The invention particularly contemplates providing the nucleic acids of interest to bacteria and yeast. Suitable bacteria include both archaebacteria, which are found in incommodious environments such as bogs, ocean depths, salt brines, and hot acid springs (e.g. sulfur bacteria, extreme halophiles, methanogens), and eubacteria, which are the commonly encountered forms that inhabit soil, water, and larger living organisms (e.g. gram positive, anaerobic, blue-green algae, gram negative, and spirochetes). In a preferred embodiment, the bacteria are <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli</italic></highlight>. Suitable yeast include a large group of disparate organisms.

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Preferred yeast vectors include plasmids such as those capable of replication in either <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>or <highlight><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic></highlight>. These vectors include, but are not limited to, pYES2, pVT101, Yip5, Prp7, Yrp17, Pep13, Yep24, Ycp19, Ycp50, Ylp21, pYAC3, 2 &mgr;m, pLG670.

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods may be used to introduce the polynucleotide sequences into a microorganism. In bacteria for example, techniques such as transformation of plasmid DNA using calcium chloride competent cells, high efficiency competent cells, electroporation, or infection by bacteriophages as described in <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Mass., USA (1998) may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In yeast, methods to introduce polynucleotides can include, but are not limited to, the introduction of polynucleotides by integrative transformation, transformation by electroporation, spheroplast transformation, transformation using lithium acetate as described in <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Mass., USA (1998) and PEG lithium acetate transformation procedure (Eble, R., 1992<highlight><italic>, Biotechniques </italic></highlight>13:18-20). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Also within the scope of the present invention is the conference of drug resistance to eukaryotic cell lines grown in tissue culture, including insect cell lines and mammalian cell lines. The conference of drug resistance to eukaryotic cell lines may be useful in the use of such cell lines for the production of recombinant proteins, the study of chemotherapeutic resistance in cells from various sources, and in the study of toxic levels of drugs in certain resistant cell lines. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the invention, modulation of the ATP gradient, specifically the suppression of the gradient, may be achieved by inhibiting the activity of the ecto-phosphatase and the ABC transporter. Suitable inhibitor mechanisms include, but are not limited to, the use of small molecules which may bind to and inhibit the activity of the ecto-phosphatase and small molecules which may bind to and inhibit the ABC transporter. Other suitable inhibitor mechanisms include, but are not limited to, the expression of anti-sense RNA molecules which may inhibit the transcription or translation of ecto-phosphatases and ABC transporters, as well as the expression of dominant negative mutants of the ecto-phosphatase and the ABC transporters which may act to interfere with and inhibit the activity of their wild-type counterparts. Also within the scope of the invention is the over-expression of regulatory molecules which inhibit the activity of the ecto-phosphatase and the ABC transporter. The ecto-phosphatase may be inhibited alone or together with the ABC transporter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide molecules which down-regulate the activity of ecto-phosphatases either alone or together with ABC transporters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for methods for the transcription of exogenous antisense RNA, in vivo or in vitro, comprising the administration of a polycistronic vector which may contain nucleic acid molecules from which may be transcribed an antisense RNA complementary to an ecto-phosphatase RNA molecule and an ABC transporter RNA molecule. The ecto-phosphatase nucleic acids and the ABC transporter nucleic acids may be operatively linked to a constitutive promoter or an inducible promoter (e.g. the constitutive major intermediate early promoter of cytomegalovirus or the inducible metallothionine promoter). Also within the scope of the invention are multiple vectors whereby the ecto-phosphatase nucleic acid and the ABC transporter nucleic acid are incorporated into separate vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides for methods for the expression of exogenous regulatory molecules or small molecules, in vivo or in vitro, comprising the administration of a polycistronic vector or multiple vectors which may incorporate nucleic acid molecules encoding for regulatory proteins, or small molecules capable of inhibiting the activity of an ecto-phosphatase and an ABC transporter. These nucleic acids which encode for regulatory molecules may be operatively linked to either a constitutive promoter or an inducible promoter as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it is an object of the present invention to provide inhibitors of ecto-phosphatases (e.g. apyrase) in physiological compositions for modulating MDR states. Such physiological compositions comprise a small molecule capable of inhibiting an ecto-phosphatase and a physiologically acceptable carrier or diluent. As used herein, the term &ldquo;physiologically acceptable carrier or diluent&rdquo; means any and all solvents, dispersion media, antibacterial and antifungal agents, microcapsules, liposomes, cationic lipid carriers, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like which are not incompatible with the ecto-phosphatase inhibitors. The use of such media and agents for physiologically active substances is well known in the art. Supplementary active ingredients may also be incorporated into the compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In certain preferred embodiments, only the endogenous ecto-phosphatase is inhibited by antisense RNA, regulatory proteins, or small molecules. In other embodiments of the present invention, both the endogenous ecto-phosphatase and the ABC transporter are targeted for inhibition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In particularly preferred embodiments, the ecto-phosphatase is human apyrase (e.g. GenBank accession &num; AF034840, AF039916, AF039917, AF039918, HSU87967) and the MDR-ABC transporter is human MDR-1, (e.g. human P-glycoprotein MDR-1, GenBank accession &num; M29432 and human MRP-&bgr; PCT, publication WO 98/46736). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid molecules from which will be transcribed antisense RNA molecules described above or the nucleic acid molecules encoding for regulatory molecules as described above may be incorporated into any suitable cloning or expression vector, operably linked to appropriate control elements (e.g. promoter elements, enhancer elements, ribosomal binding sites, polyadenylation sites, termination sites, etc.). Examples of such vectors include, but are not limited to, herpes simplex viral based vectors such as pHSV1 (Geller et al., 1990<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </italic></highlight>87:8950-8954); retroviral vectors such as MFG (Jaffee et al., 1993<highlight><italic>, Cancer Res. </italic></highlight>53:2221-2226), and in particular Moloney retroviral vectors such as LN, LNSX, LNCX, LXSN (Miller and Rosman, 1989<highlight><italic>, Biotechniques </italic></highlight>7:980-989); vaccinia viral vectors such as MVA (Sutter and Moss, 1992<highlight><italic>, Proc.

U.S.A. </italic></highlight>89:10847-10851); adenovirus vectors such as pJM17 (Ali et al., 1994<highlight><italic>, Gene Therapy </italic></highlight>1:367-384; Berker, 1988<highlight><italic>, Biotechniques </italic></highlight>6:616-624; Wand and Finer, 1996<highlight><italic>, Nature Medicine </italic></highlight>2:714-716); adeno-associated virus vectors such as AAV/neo (Mura-Cacho et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, J. Immunother. </italic></highlight>11:231-237); lentivirus vectors (Zufferey et al., 1997<highlight><italic>, Nature Biotechnology </italic></highlight>15:871-875). Such vectors may be targeted to the tumor cells of interest as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,834,256, 5,843,742, 5,830,727, 5,814,500. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The inhibition of ecto-phosphatases either alone or together with the inhibition of ABC transporters is useful in the reduction of drug resistance in cells. In one embodiment of the invention, the inhibition of ecto-phosphatases either alone or together with ABC transporters results in a loss of resistance to drug molecules used in chemotherapy. In another embodiment of the invention, administration of such inhibitory molecules is in conjunction with the administration of chemotherapeutic agents in tumor cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Administration of the foregoing agents may be local or systemic, using a suitable physiological carrier.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Inhibition of Drug Resistance in Microorganisms to Treat Infection </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to methods for inhibiting or ameliorating infection in animals and humans caused by microorganisms, particularly bacterial and fungal infections using inhibitory mechanisms against an ecto-phosphatase and an ABC transporter and modifying the ATP gradient across biological membranes. The invention is useful in the inhibition or amelioration of a wide range of infections including, but not limited to, gram-negative bacterial infection including gram-negative sepsis, gram-negative endotoxin-related hypotension and shock, rabies, cholera, tetanus, lymes disease, tuberculosis, <highlight><italic>Candida albicans, Chlamydia, </italic></highlight>etc. The invention is based, in part, on the unexpected result that when mutant yeast deficient in two potent extracellular ATP phosphatases were cultured in cycloheximide, they were not able to grow. Surprisingly, they were rescued by the over-expression of a plant MDR-ABC transporter AtPGP-1, suggesting that the inability to grow in the drug was caused by an inability to efflux the drug which was coupled to a deficiency in extracellular ATP phosphatase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Drug sensitivity in microorganisms may be achieved by introducing nucleic acid molecules into bacteria and yeast (as described above) that are capable of conferring inhibition of the activity of an endogenous ecto-phosphatase and an ABC transporter. Such nucleic acid molecules may transcribe an antisense RNA complimentary to endogenous RNA for an ecto-phosphatase or an ABC transporter, encode for inhibitory regulatory proteins, or encode for inhibitory drug molecules. The inhibition or amelioration of the infections may involve the administration of an anti-microbial agent (such as an antibiotic or an antifungal agent) with the concurrent administration of the aforementioned nucleic acid molecules (which may be achieved through bacteriophages, etc). Additionally, inhibitors of ecto-phosphatases or ABC transporters may be administered via a physiologically acceptable carrier as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the present invention is useful in the development of genetic and epigenetic systems in humans for resistance to toxins from biological and non-biological sources. Such sources include, but are not restricted to, pathogens produced by microbial infections, pathogens and toxins derived from biological sources through human contrivance, environmental toxins not produced through biological action, and toxic substances created synthetically. In a particular embodiment, humans at risk for exposure would be vaccinated either with a gene therapy designed to bolster endogenous ATP gradients in human cells, or a chemical substance capable of enhancing the strength of the ATP gradient. In both instances, the target of the genetic or chemical therapy would be either the ABC transporter activity, ecto-phosphatase activity or both. In another embodiment of the invention, only the ABC transporter activity or the ecto-phosphatase activity in an infecting organism is diminished to inhibit drug efflux. Recombinant techniques may be used to introduce DNA sequences to the microorganism which encode for a small inhibitory molecule to either an ABC transporter or an ecto-phosphatase or both to cause the inhibition of drug efflux from the microorganism. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Ecto-Phosphatase Inhibition </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Since ecto-phosphatases have been shown by the present invention to be important actors in the modulation of the ATP gradient across biological membranes and thus useful in a variety of applications (e.g. the modulation of drug resistance), it is an object of the present invention to provide methods and assays for the identification of inhibitors of ecto-phosphatases (e.g. apyrase). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A high-throughput screen was developed to rapidly identify potential inhibitors for ecto-phosphatases and is described below in Example 6. This high-throughput screen is particularly useful, since no known specific inhibitors of the apyrase enzyme exist. Using the high throughput screen, ecto-phosphatase inhibitors are isolated by screening a small molecule library (e.g. a combinatorial library) for inhibitory activity to ecto-phosphatase (e.g. apyrase) activity. Once ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules are isolated from such a screen, the inhibitors may be further tested for their ability to specifically inhibit the ATPase activity of the ecto-phosphatase and to reduce drug resistance in cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention are chemically stable and physiologically active and include, inter alia, those molecules represented by Formulae I through XIX below.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Preliminary pharmacophore studies revealed that the small molecules represented by Formulae I through XIX fall into five classes of compounds (sulfanamides, guanidines, aminothiazoles, thioketones and benzamides). Most of these chemical classes are found in other physiologically-active compounds, including those having pharmaceutical and therapeutic use. For example, sulfanimides are widely used as antibiotics. Additionally, studies for the isolation of small molecules capable of reversing MDR have described molecules belonging to two of the classes of molecules of the present invention (Medina et al., 1998<highlight><italic>, Bioorg Med. Chem. Lett. </italic></highlight>8:2653-2656 and Dhamant et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, J. Med. Chem. </italic></highlight>35:2481-2496). The molecules described by Medina et al. have been shown to affect MDR and the mode of action of the molecules is believed to involve tubulin interactions. The thiazine derivatives described by Dhamant et al. reverse the resistance in tumor cells to vincristine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention are useful in reversing MDR in Arabidopsis plants and yeast. MDR reversal in plants and yeast cells may be shown by growing the cells in the presence of relevant drugs and in the presence and absence of the inhibitor. Cells which cannot grow in drug, in the presence of an ecto-phosphatase inhibitor, have a reversal in MDR. Additionally, the ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention are useful in reversing drug resistance in mammalian cell lines (e.g. normal COS-7 cells and breast cancer tumor cells (e.g. HS5787, MB231 and MB435)) grown in the presence of a drug (e.g. a chemotherapeutic agent). MDR reversal in mammalian cells may be shown by using the flourescent compound calcein-AM. Esterases present in cells cleave the aceto-methoxy ester (AM) from the calcein-AM and liberate calcein. Calcein is a flourescent compound which is excitable by the 488 nm laser of a FACSCaliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.), while the uncleaved calcein-AM is not excitable. Wild type cells incubated in the presence of calcein-AM show a high level of fluorescence while MDR state cells, which efflux the calcein-AM faster than the cellular esterases can cleave it, do not show a high level of fluorescence. The mammalian cells can be tested for the reversal of MDR with the ecto-phosphatase inhibitors of the present invention by the amount of calcein fluorescence detected in the cells. Furthermore, the relative importance of the mammalian MDR gene and the mammalian apyrase gene in MDR can also be determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Specificity of the ecto-phosphatase inhibitors of the present invention may be tested with the screening assay described in Example 6 below. Inhibitors are tested for their ability to inhibit acid phosphatases, alkaline phosphatases, myosin phosphatases and the luciferase ATPase. The assays may be performed using techniques known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment, the ecto-phosphatase is an apyrase and the ecto-phosphatase inhibitor is a molecule selected from among molecules represented by the Formulae I through XIX. In another preferred embodiment, the ecto-phosphatase is apyrase and the ecto-phosphatase inhibitor is a molecule selected from among molecules represented by the Formulae I through V. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the ecto-phosphatase is apyrase and the ecto-phosphatase inhibitor is a molecule selected from among molecules represented by Formula I and Formula II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The ecto-phosphatase inhibitors of the present invention which are acidic or basic in nature can form a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic bases or acids, respectively. These salts may be physiologically acceptable for in vivo administration in plants and animals, including humans. Salts of the acidic compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the acidic compound with an appropriate molar quantity of the chosen inorganic or organic base in an aqueous or suitable organic solvent and then evaporating the solvent to obtain the salt. Salts of the basic compounds of this invention can be obtained similarly by treatment with the desired inorganic or organic acid and subsequent solvent evaporation and isolation. The skilled artisan can produce salts of the small molecules of the present invention using techniques known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The skilled artisan readily can determine the amount of the ecto-phosphatase inhibitor that is required to inhibit the ecto-phosphatase by measuring ATPase activity in the presence and absence of varying amounts of the inhibitor. Phosphatase activity can be determined by assessing the dephosphorylation of ATP and liberation of phosphate as described below in Example 6. Additionally, parameters may be measured that are known to be associated with ecto-phosphatase activity to determine whether the molecule has ecto-phosphatase inhibitory activity. For example, ecto-phosphatase inhibitory activity may be measured in cells (e.g. plant, yeast, mammalian, tumor, etc. cell lines) by assessing the loss of resistance to drugs. Furthermore, the ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention may be tested for specific inhibitory activity to ecto-phosphatases versus general phosphatases or for specific inhibitory activity for a particular ecto-phosphatase activity (e.g. apyrase). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as stated above, the ecto-phosphatase inhibitory molecules of the present invention are useful in reversing MDR. Such a reversal has several applications including reducing resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in tumor cells and reducing resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Inhibition of ecto-phosphatases is useful in industrial applications as well. For example, one of the most sensitive and cost effective ways of determining the titer of microbia in soil, sludge, blood, food, and textiles is the luciferase assay which allows for the estimation of microbial biomass through the determination of precise concentrations of ATP. The sensitivity of the assay requires that &ldquo;background&rdquo; ATP or nonmicrobial ATP present in the system as a consequence of the source of the sample be separated from the ATP used in the microbe count. The removal of background ATP is accomplished using the ecto-phosphatase, apyrase. After removal of the background ATP with apyrase, the apyrase must be removed or inactivated. General techniques for removal could be improved and simplified with a method of inactivating the apyrase by adding a specific apyrase inhibitor of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides physiologically acceptable compositions comprising an ecto-phosphatase inhibitor of the present invention and a physiologically acceptable carrier or diluent as described above. The use of such physiologically acceptable carriers or diluents are well known in the art. Formulation of such physiological compositions can be made using known procedures, e.g. according to Remington&apos;s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17<highlight><superscript>ed</superscript></highlight>., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. Formulation of the compounds of the present invention may be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against contamination by microorganisms. Contamination can be avoided using antimicrobial (e.g. antibacterial and antifungal) agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The physiological forms of the compounds of the invention suitable for administration include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Typical carriers include a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water buffered aqueous solutions (i.e. biocompatible buffers), ethanol, polyols such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, surfactants, and vegetable oils. Isotonic agents such as sugars or sodium chloride may be incorporated into the subject compositions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In all experiments the growth media did not contain sugar, and plants were grown in sterile culture at 22&deg; C. under 150-200 &mgr;E of continuous light. Unless otherwise noted, a standard 0.8% agar medium (Becton Dickenson, Cockeysville, Md.) containing 100 &mgr;M phosphate was used for uptake assays (Somerville, C. et al., 1982<highlight><italic>, Methods in Chloroplast Biology, </italic></highlight>Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam, pp 129-138). Plants used for the phosphate uptake experiments were grown singly in 1 ml of the standard agar medium for 15 days prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, 10 &mgr;Ci <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P was applied to the side of the culture dish and allowed to diffuse through the agar. The lids of 95 mm&times;15 mm tissue culture dishes (Fisher, Pittsburgh, Pa.) were removed to facilitate transpiration. After 18 hours, the plants were removed from the medium. The aerial portions of the plant not in contact with the agar were weighed and counted by liquid scintillation. For each plant the entire root system was carefully pulled from the agar and washed in ice cold water prior to scintillation counting. To measure the transport of the products of ATP hydrolysis by the transgenic plants overexpressing apyrase and by wild-type plants, &lsqb;2,8<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H&rsqb;ATP, &lsqb;&agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP, and &lsqb;&ggr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb; ATP (Amersham) were fed to 15-day-old plants in separate treatments.

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> By immunoblot assay, the pea apyrase was found to be associated with nuclei and with purified plasma membranes but not with the cytoplasm (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). The contents of the lanes in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> are as follows: Lane 1, cytoplasm; Lane 2, purified plasma membrane; Lane 3, purified nuclei; and Lane 4, pre-immune control of nuclei. Protease treatment destroyed both apyrase activity and antigenicity in outside-out plasma membrane vesicles. After trypsin treatment, the exterior face of the vesicle showed 30% of the ecto-phosphatase activity of the untreated sample. Endo-phosphatase activities were retained after trypsin treatment, indicating that the digest occurred exclusively on the exterior face of the membrane. These data indicated that the ecto-apyrase was in fact being expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Enhanced Growth of Plants Over-Expressing Apyrase: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Three of the four transgenic plant lines constitutively expressed psNTP9 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and over an 18 hour period showed two to five times as much phosphate accumulation in shoots as wild type (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B); Top, the total phosphate accumulated in the shoots of three independent transformants in an 18 hour <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P uptake assay at 2 mM phosphate; Bottom, a corresponding immunoblot performed on equal amounts of protein isolated from the ECM of three week-old wild-type <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>and the psNTP9 transgenics. Apyrase expressing plants also showed four times as much phosphatase activity in the extracellular matrix as the wild-type (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>). (Note, OE 1 in the figure stands for over-expression 1 transgenic line). Transgenic plants preferentially transport the gamma phosphate of ATP: In order to address whether over-expression of ecto-apyrase was stimulating the adenosine salvage pathway, the intracellular uptake of adenosine was measured both in the presence and absence of the over-expression of apyrase. The inability of apyrase to translocate either extracellular AMP or adenosine was demonstrated by the low level of radiolabel accumulated in the transgenic plants fed &lsqb;2,8<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H&rsqb;ATP and &lsqb;&agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The complete dephosphorylation of &lsqb;2,8<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H&rsqb;ATP would result in a radiolabelled adenosine molecule while the complete dephosphorylation of &lsqb;&agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP would result in a non-labeled adenosine label. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> illustrates that plants overexpressing apyrase did not translocate radiolabelled adenosine (or byproducts of the dephosphorylation of &lsqb;2,8<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>H&rsqb;ATP) any more efficiently than plants not overexpressing apyrase (wild-type plants). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> illustrates that plants overexpressing apyrase did not translocate AMP (or the byproducts of the dephosphorylated &lsqb;&agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP) any more efficiently than wild-type plants. In comparison, feeding experiments where the y phosphate was labeled, the transgenics accumulated three times the amount of labeled phosphate as the wild-type (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>). These data show that the over-expression of apyrase does not induce an increase in the uptake of adenosine and therefore its over-expression does not act to stimulate the adenosine salvage pathway. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Effect of Over-Expression of AtPGP-1 in Yeast: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> When a yeast mutant, YMR4, which is deficient in two major extracellular phosphatases and tends to accumulate ATP extracelluarly, was grown in a potent cellular toxin, cycloheximide, it did not grow whereas a wild-type yeast strain, INVSC1, did grow in the presence of cycloheximide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>). Surprisingly, expression of the plant multidrug resistance (MDR) gene, AtPGP-1, enabled the yeast mutant to grow in the toxin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). The presence of AtPGP-1 in the wild-type yeast did not have any effect when. grown in the presence of cycloheximide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>). The same result was obtained when the yeast strains were cultured in nigericin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C, 3D</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B, 5C</cross-reference>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</cross-reference>, starting from the top of the dish clockwise, the cells are as follows: INVSC1 (wild-type) overexpressing AtPGP-1, YMR4 containing the vector alone, YMR4 overexpressing AtPGP-1, and INVSC1 containing the vector alone. When grown without drug, all the cells grow (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). However, when grown in drug, only the YMR4 containing vector alone shows reduced growth. The survival of the AtPGP-1 transformed strains was due to the ability of the MDR1 channel to efflux the toxin, hence lowering the actual cellular concentration of the poison cycloheximide. The sensitivity of the untransformed mutant to the drug is likely due to a loss of the ATP gradient below a point at which endogenous transporters, similar to AtPGP-1 can function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Effect of Over-Expression of AtPGP-1 in Plants: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The over-expression of AtPGP-1 was able to confer resistance to cycloheximide in plants (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 6</cross-reference>) and to the cytokinin, N<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>-(2-isopentenyl) adenine (2IP) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). These results had not been observed previously and in fact, the prior art actually teaches away from this finding suggesting that over-expression of plant AtPGP-1 is not involved in drug resistance. See Sidler, M. et al., 1998<highlight><italic>, The Plant Cell </italic></highlight>10:1623-1636. Therefore, this result was particularly unexpected in plants. Additionally, since Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtPGP-1 are able to grow in both cycloheximide and cytokinin, this suggests that the conference of drug resistance by AtPGP-1 is likely to be seen with other chemicals as well and is not an isolated phenomenon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Effect of Over-Expression of Apyrase on Drug Resistance in Plants: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Another unexpected result was obtained when the plant apyrase gene was over-expressed in plants. Over-expression of apyrase in plants resulted in the conference of resistance to cycloheximide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 6</cross-reference>). The same result was obtained when the plants were grown in the presence of a cytokinin, N<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>-(2-isopentenyl) adenine (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). In fact, over-expression of apyrase is surprisingly able to raise the germination rate above the level obtained by the over-expression of the MDR gene AtPGP-1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). Just as under-expression of phosphatase activity in a yeast mutant lacking two potent extracellular phosphatases diminished its resistance to cycloheximide (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>), over-expression of a powerful extracellular ATP phosphatase in plants bolstered resistance. The fact that higher resistance was found in plants genetically manipulated only with respect to phosphatase over-expression and not MDR1, indicates that there likely exists other ATP-symporters used in detoxification in addition to MDR1. Minimally, the stronger ATP gradient set up by apyrase in the transgenic plants affects the kinetics of the wild-type MDR1. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In wild-type cells there is a steady-state level of ATP in the extracellular fluid, which is to say that the ATP outside the cells is rapidly degraded by phosphatases and does not accumulate over time (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). However, the expression of the AtPGP-1 doubled this steady-state level (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). If the yeast mutant, YMR4, which is deficient in extracellular phosphatase activity, is analyzed, there was a noticeable accumulation of ATP in the extracellular fluid compared to a control mutant transformed with empty plasmid pVT101 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). In addition to ATP measurements based on luminometry performed on a kinetic time-scale of hours, an earlier differential ATP efflux in MDR1 expressing cells by pulse chase experiments was demonstrated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Furthermore, <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>plants from two independently transformed lines, that constitutively express the AtPGP-1 protein, showed a significant accumulation of ATP on their leaf surfaces (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). Taken together, these data demonstrate the absolute ability of plant MDR1, AtPGP-1, to transport ATP from inside the cell to the outside. Moreover, these data show that ATP efflux channels and phosphatases both have roles in the steady-state level of ATP outside of the cell. This is the first demonstration of the importance of extracellular ATP steady-state levels, and the importance of an ATP gradient across biological membranes in the modulation of drug resistance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Arabidopsis seeds were sown in a solid germination media containing MS salts (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.), 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar, and vitamins (Valvekens, D. et al., 1992<highlight><italic>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85:5536-5540). For selection assays, one of the following, or a combination of both, was added to media (cooled to less than 50&deg; C. before adding) immediately prior to pouring into plates: cycloheximide at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml; &agr;,&bgr;-methyleneadenosine 5&prime;-diphosphate at a final concentration of 1 mM.

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows that when wild-type and AtPGP-1 overexpressing (MDR OE) <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>plants were either treated with nothing (lane 1), cycloheximide (lane 2), &agr;,&bgr;-methyleneadenosine 5&prime;-diphosphate (phosphatase inhibitor) (lane 3), or cycloheximide and phosphatase inhibitor (lane 4), both the wild-type and the AtPGP-1 overexpressing plants were affected similarly by the presence of phosphatase inhibitor. While the AtPGP-1 overexpressing plants grew significantly better in the presence of cycloheximide alone with a 50% germination rate for the AtPGP-1 overexpressing plants and a 2% germination rate for the wild-type plants, similar germination rates were seen for both the AtPGP-1 overexpressing and wild-type plants in the presence of either phosphatase inhibitor alone (83% and 90% germination respectively) or cycloheximide plus phosphatase inhibitor (no germination at all). The addition of phosphatase inhibitor surprisingly destroys the ability of the AtPGP-expressing plants to grow in the presence of cycloheximide. These data suggest that phosphatases are involved in the conference of drug resistance in plants and that there is a two-component system similar to that demonstrated in yeast in Example 2 and 3 above in which an MDR-like protein and an ATP-gradient-maintaining ecto-phosphatase are important in modulating drug resistance. </paragraph>

Cells cultured in media alone: To create cell lines that had not been preselected for their ability to grow in drug, yeast strains were grown on plates containing YNB (Bio101, Vista, Calif.) without uracil (-URA) to maintain the presence of the vector (which supplies URA) without any drugs added. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> An ATP Gradient is Critical in MDR: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The importance of the ATP gradient in MDR in yeast cells was demonstrated by showing that the growth of cells which were previously grown in drug and had developed resistance to the drug, were not able to grow in high levels of ATP unless they were overexpressing AtPGP-1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). Cells which had not been previously selected in drug were able to grow in the presence of high levels of ATP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). These data emphasize that the loss of an ATP gradient is previously resistant cell lines abolishes resistance. This result is new to the understanding of MDR and has led to vast insight into the understanding of the mechanism by which MDR-ABC transporters confer resistance to cells and to methods to modulate such resistance. Moreover, when cells were grown in high levels of ATP and drug (cycloheximide), even the cell lines which had previously showed resistance to drug were unable to grow in the presence of drug and ATP. These data indicate that when the ATP gradient across biological membranes is destroyed (by the presence of high extracellular levels of ATP), efflux of drugs cannot be achieved and therefore, drug resistance is abolished. In summary, the multi-drug resistance channel is not functional without an ATP gradient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The Drug Resistance is not Due to an Adenosine Salvage Pathway: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In order to address whether the involvement of a nucleotide salvage pathway was responsible for the results of the present invention, yeast cells were cultured in the presence of extracellular adenosine and extracellular phosphate. The acid phosphatase yeast mutant, YMR4, was selected because its decreased ecto-phosphatase activity makes it an ideal candidate for studying the effect of extracellular nucleotides on growth. If an adenosine salvage pathway were involved, then the presence of extracellular adenosine or possibly phosphate should help cells recoup the intracellular ATP losses due to ATP/drug efflux and should help cells grow in the presence of drug whether or not the cells were overexpressing AtPGP-1. In contrast, however, the addition of adenosine or phosphate to the media did not enhance resistance to the cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). In fact, cells overexpressing AtPGP-1 grew best in drug alone, with the addition of adenosine and/or phosphate being slightly inhibitory. Furthermore, cells which did not express AtPGP-1 were unable to grow in drug regardless of the presence of adenosine and/or phosphate. These data suggest that an adenosine salvage pathway is not the principal mechanism at work in the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Material and Methods </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Small Molecule Library: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> A small molecule library (DIVERSet format F), which was specifically constructed to maximize structural diversity in a relatively small library (9600 compounds), was obtained from ChemBridge Corporation (San Diego, Calif.). The small molecules (supplied in 0.1 mg dehydrated aliquots) were dissolved in DMSO, transferred to a 96 well plate, and tested for their ability to inhibit apyrase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The Assay: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> A stringent screen to test the ability of small molecules to disrupt the ATPase activity of the apyrase enzyme was developed based on phosphate-mobylate complexation. The assay was a modification of a phospholipase assay developed by Hergenrother et al. (<highlight><italic>Lipids </italic></highlight>32:783-788 (1997)). Under normal conditions, the apyrase enzyme liberates phosphate from ATP present in the reaction. The liberated phosphate quickly forms a complex upon addition of a small amount of acidified molybdate and ascorbate allowing for the production of a very dark blue color (the less phosphate liberated, the less blue color). Control reactions were performed with heat inactivated apyrase enzyme. Color intensity was detected on an Alpha Imager 2000 with AlphaEase&trade; software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, Calif.). Color changes were also evident by the naked eye. A Biomek 2000 robot (Beckman, Fullerton, Calif.) was used for screening the 9600 samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> To each well of the 96 well plates containing a small molecule from the library, 100 &mgr;l of reaction buffer (60 mM HEPES, 3 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 3 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 3 mM ATP pH 7.0) was added. The apyrase (potato apyrase grade VI, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, Mo.) enzyme (0.1 units) was added in a 5 &mgr;l volume and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Three buffers were used to visualize activity: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Buffer A: 2% Ammonium molybdate in water </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Buffer B: 11% Ascorbic acid in 37.5% aqueous TCA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Buffer C: 2% trisodium citrate, 2% acetic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Immediately before developing the assay, buffers A and B were mixed in a 1: 1.5 ratio. 50 &mgr;l of A:B was added to each well. The 96 well plate was then vibrated on a table surface to mix the solution. The deep blue color developed after approximately 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, 50 &mgr;l of buffer C was added to each well and the blue color became darker, increasing the sensitivity of the assay. The color intensified for up to one hour with no accompanying color change in the control wells containing heat inactivated apyrase enzyme. The color intensity for a single plate was measured on an Alpha Imager 2000 with AlphaEase&trade; software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, Calif.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Results: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Nineteen positives were identified from the 9600 compound DIVERSet library.

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Among homogenous hydrogenation catalysts, the most widely used are RhCl(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(Wilkinson&apos;s catalyst)<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)(PCy<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>&lsqb;py&equals;pyridine; cod&equals;cyclooctadiene&rsqb; (1, Crabtree&apos;s catalyst)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Nucleophilic N-heterocyclic carbenes, or so-called &ldquo;phosphine mimics&rdquo;, have attracted considerable attention as possible alternatives for the widely used phosphine ligands in homogeneous catalysis.<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>Indeed, the inventors and others had found that the replacement of bulky phosphines with sterically demanding N-heterocyclic carbenes IPr (IPr&equals;1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) or IMes (IMes&equals;1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) can result in significant catalytic performance in olefin metathesis,<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>C&mdash;C bond formation reaction,<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>animation of aryl chlorides,<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>hydrogenation<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>and hydroformylation<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Also incorporated by reference is the paper which describes an embodiment of the present invention, which was attached to U.S. Provisional patent application serial No. 60/251,075, filed Dec. 4, 2000, under the title &ldquo;A Cationic Iridium Complex Bearing an Imidazolidine-2-ylidene Ligand as Alkene Hydrogenation Catalyst&rdquo;, and which was published in <highlight><italic>Organometallics </italic></highlight>(2001), vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 1255-1258 under the title: &ldquo;A Cationic Iridium Complex Bearing an Imidazol-2-ylidene Ligand as Alkene Hydrogenation Catalyst&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In view of these findings and in their continued search for more efficient and stable catalysts, the inventors turned their attention to the Crabtree-type iridium hydrogenation catalyst. The inventors wished to examine whether the replacement of PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>with SIMes (1,3-dimesityl-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene or related n-heterocyclic carbenes, which is trivially called herein saturated IMes or SIMes) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in 1 could lead to the generation of a more active and more thermally tolerant hydrogenation catalyst. The present inventors now report the synthesis of a new iridium carbene complex &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)(SIMes)&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(2) and its catalytic behavior in the hydrogenation of olefins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Attached to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/289,073 and incorporated herein by reference is a copy of a manuscript entitled &ldquo;Cationic Iridium Complexes Bearing Imidazol-2-ylidene Ligands As Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysts&rdquo; which describes work on transfer hydrogenation using an Iridium catalyst. This paper has appeared in print as &ldquo;Cationic Iridium Complexes Bearing an Imidazolidine-2-ylidene Ligand as Transfer Hydrogenation Catalysts.&rdquo; Hillier, A. C.; Lee, H. M.; Stevens, E. D.; Nolan, S. P. <highlight><italic>Organometallics, </italic></highlight>2001, 20, 4246-4252. This is complementary to our earlier work involving hydrogenation with dihydrogen described in the paper which describes an embodiment of the present invention, which was attached to U.S. Provisional patent application serial No. 60/251,075, filed Dec. 4, 2000, under the title &ldquo;A Cationic Iridium Complex Bearing an Imidazolidine-2-ylidene Ligand as Alkene Hydrogenation Catalyst&rdquo;, and which was published in <highlight><italic>Organometallics </italic></highlight>(2001), vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 1255-1258 under the title: &ldquo;A Cationic Iridium Complex Bearing an Imidazol-2-ylidene Ligand as Alkene Hydrogenation Catalyst&rdquo;. Both of these papers, and all references recited therein, are also incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes hydrogenation with H atom sources other than hydrogen gas. This is what is so special about this discovery. Other examples exist but this is a fairly active system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes hydrogenation with dihydrogen and transfer hydrogenation (alcohols are source of H atoms). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The Ir catalysts described herein perform catalytic transfer hydrogenation using an inexpensive alcohol as the H atom source. The systems are versatile, hydrogenating both ketones and olefin. Very low catalyst loadings are required. The systems are very tolerant to elevated temperatures. The systems bear a nucleophilic carbene as ancillary ligand which affords a steric and electronic handle on the catalyst activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention allows for either hydrogenation or transfer hydrogenation using inexpensive alcohols as the H atom source. The present catalyst systems allow both to be performed within essentially the same framework. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The new cationic iridium carbene complex &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)(SIMes)&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(2) has been synthesized by reaction of &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>with SIMes. Complex 2 is an active hydrogenation catalyst capable of hydrogenating simple olefins at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The cationic iridium carbene complexes &lsqb;Ir(cod)(N)(L)&rsqb;X have been synthesized by reaction of &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>with L or NL ligands. Complexes of this type are active hydrogenation catalysts capable of hydrogenating simple olefins at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of hydrogen or by transfer hydrogenation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes an iridium carbene complex of the formula &lsqb;Ir(diene)(N)(L)&rsqb;X. where diene is a diene or two monoene, N is a 2 electron nitrogen donor, L is a bulky nucleophilic carbene, and X is an anionic counterion. This complex is preferably prepared by a simple ligand exchange reaction of &lsqb;Ir(diene)(N)2&rsqb;X with L in toluene. Preferably an excess of L is used. The L can be prepared and used in situ by the reaction of L.HCl with KOBu<highlight><superscript>t </superscript></highlight>in THF, and the free carbene can be extracted with toluene and treated with &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>or equivalent precursors directly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> This complex can be used as a catalyst in a hydrogenation reaction in a method of hydrogenating simple olefins, comprising: The reaction can occurs at a pressure of 0.1 to 150 atmosphere and a temperature of 0-150&deg; C.; for example, the reaction can occurs at a pressure of about 1 atm and a temperature of about 50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes an iridium carbene complex of the formula &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)(SIMes)&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6.</subscript></highlight>; the complex can be prepared by a simple ligand exchange reaction of &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>with SIMes in toluene. Preferably, an excess of SIMes is used. The SIMes can be prepared and used in situ by the reaction of SIMes.HCl with KOBu<highlight><superscript>t </superscript></highlight>in THF, and the free carbene is extracted with toluene and treated with &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>directly. This complex can be used as a catalyst in a hydrogenation reaction for hydrogenating simple olefins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The reaction can occur at a pressure of 0.1 to 150 atm and a temperature of 0 to 150&deg; C. For example, the reaction can occur at a pressure of about 1 atm and a temperature of about 50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises an olefin hydrogenation catalyst bearing a nucleophilic carbene ligand. This catalyst can be used as a catalyst in a hydrogenation reaction to hydrogenate simple olefins. This hydrogenation can occur with H atom sources other than hydrogen gas. For example, the hydrogenation can comprise transfer hydrogenation; in such a case, alcohol can be the source of H atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention also comprises a complex of the formula Ir(cod)(py)(L)&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, where L is from the group consisting of: IMes, 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-imidazol-2-ylidene; IPr, 1,3-bis(2,6-di-iso-propylphenyl)-imidazol-2-ylidene; ICy, 1,3-bis(cyclohexyl)-imidazol-2-ylidene; and chiral carbene. This complex can be used as a catalyst for transfer hydrogenation reactions. This complex can be used as a catalyst in a method of hydrogenating simple olefins. The hydrogenation reaction can occur at a pressure of 0.1 to 150 atmosphere and a temperature of 0-150&deg; C.; for example, the reaction can occur at a pressure of about 1 atm and a temperature of about 50&deg; C. L can be ICy, 1,3-bis(cyclohexyl)-imidazol-2-ylidene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention also includes an iridium carbene complex of the formula &lsqb;Ir(diene)(N-L)&rsqb;X. where: diene is a diene or two monoene; N is a 2 electron nitrogen donor from the group consisting of oxazolines, phosphines, and carbenes; L is a bulky nucleophilic carbene; X is an anionic counterion; and N and L are tethered so N and L make a bidentate ligand. The two fragments can be tethered using a variety of subunits as known in the art. N can be an oxazoline so N-L is an oxazoline-carbene ligand; or N can be a phosphine so N&mdash;L is an phosphino-carbene ligand, or N can be a carbene and N-L is a bis-carbene ligand. A chiral version of the complex can be used as a catalyst in a method of catalyzing asymmetric hydrogenation reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention also can be characterized as an iridium carbene complex of the formula &lsqb;Ir(diene)(R-C)&rsqb;X. where: diene is a diene or two monoene; R&mdash;C is a chelating ligand; R is from the group consisting of phosphorus donors, oxygen donors, and nitrogen donors; C is a carbene; and X is an anionic counterion. R-C can be a chelating ligand from the group consisting of carbene-carbene, phosphine-carbene, and oxazoline-carbene. This complex can be used as a catalyst in a method of catalyzing hydrogenation reactions. The hydrogenation can be performed asymmetrically with a chelating ligand bearing a chiral center. The chelating ligand bearing a chiral center can be, for example, from the group consisting of chiral oxazoline-carbene, chiral phosphine-carbene, chiral carbene-oxazoline, chiral carbene-phosphine and chiral carbene-chiral carbene.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Due to the steric bulk of SIMes, this ligand could be used in slight excess to accelerate the kinetics of ligand substitution without fear of obtaining a dicarbene iridium complex. The free carbene was treated with &lsqb;Ir(cod)(py)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>directly. After stirring at room temperature for 2 d, 2 was isolated as a yellow-orange solid in 80% yield. A similar methodology has been used by Grubbs to prepare a SIMes bearing ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst.<highlight><superscript>5e </superscript></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR spectrum of 2 showed two multiplets at &dgr;3.15 and 3.80 for the vinyl protons of the cod ligand. It has been previously demonstrated for &lsqb;Ir(cod)(Cl)(L)&rsqb;PF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(L&equals;monophosphine) that the downfield signal can be assigned to the vinyl resonance trans to L (&dgr;(H<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>)). By analogy, the signal at &dgr;3.80 can be assigned to vinyl protons trans to the SIMes and that at &dgr;3.15 to the two vinyl protons trans to the pyridine ligand. Two mulitplets at &dgr;3.78 and 3.96 were observed for the methylene protons of the SIMes ligand. In order to unequivocally establish the structure of 2, a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study was performed on crystals grown from slow diffusion of diethyl ether into a saturated dichloromethane solution of 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Single Crystal X-ray Analysis of 1 and 2. As shown in the ORTEP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), 2 adopts a square-planar coordination geometry around the iridium center. The structure of 2 is very similar to that of 1, which had not previously been reported and is presented here for comparative purposes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>).<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>Selected bond lengths and angles for 1 and 2 are given in Table 1. Consistent with the greater trans influences of SIMes and PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>compared to pyridine, the Ir&mdash;C bond distances trans to the SIMes in 2 and PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in 1 are significantly longer than those trans to pyridine. This is also in accord with the vinyl protons assignments in the <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR spectrum (vide supra). Previously, we showed that IMes was a stronger &sgr;-donor than PCy<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>,<highlight><superscript>5a </superscript></highlight>so it is reasonable to assume that the saturated analogue would also have a strong &sgr;-donating capability. Consistently, the Ir&mdash;N bond distance in 2 (2.1073 &angst;) was longer than that found in 1 (2.089 &angst;) and the C&boxH;C bond distance trans to the SIMes in 2 was shorter than that trans to PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in 1 by 0.013 &angst;. A comparison of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> clearly illustrates the SIMes ligand in 2 occupying significantly more space around the iridium center than the PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>ligand in 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Catalytic Hydrogenation. The catalytic performance of 2 in the hydrogenation of simple alkenes has been investigated. The catalytic activity of 1 was also studied for comparative purposes. Selected results are listed in Table 3. The catalytic reactions were performed with 1 mol % of catalyst in 5 mL of CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. At ambient temperature and pressure of hydrogen, 2 was an efficient catalyst in the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, although displaying a lower activity than 1 (entry 1, 2). It is generally significantly more difficult to hydrogenate highly substituted alkenes. As shown in entry 3 and 4, Crabtree&apos;s catalyst gave a final 77% conversion of 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene while a modest yield of 44% was obtained when using 2. The catalytic reaction did not proceed to completion even after prolonged stirring when either 1 or 2 were employed. It had been shown that 1 undergoes an irreversible deactivation process over time involving the formation of the catalytic inactive hydrogen-bridged cluster (vide supra).

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Interestingly, 1 and 2 displayed different catalytic behaviors in the hydrogenation of 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexene, which contains both a trisubstituted and a disubstituted non conjugated double bonds. Complex 1 gave a mixture of methylcyclohexane and 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene within 1 h (entry 5). The ratio of the fully hydrogenated to the partially hydrogenated product increased slowly over time until a final ratio of 84:16 was obtained. The isomeric, partially hydrogenated product, 1-methyl-4-cyclohexene was not observed. Presumably, 1 catalyzes a simple two-step process in which the first hydrogenation occurs at the less hindered double bond to form 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene, which is then converted to the fully hydrogenated methylcyclohexane in the subsequent step. Surprisingly, 2 gave a mixture of products, methylcyclohexane, 1-methyl-4-cyclohexene, and 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene in a ratio of 3:12:25 after 1 h (entry 6). The amount of 1-methyl-4-cyclohexene increased to a maximum after 4 h and then gradually decreased with time. The yield of the fully hydrogenated product increased slowly to a final 57% yield. These results showed that, in contrast to 1, the relative kinetics of hydrogenation of the least substituted and more substituted olefins are similar. Efforts directed at understanding the relative kinetics of these hydrogenation reactions are underway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In an effort to determine the factors leading to an increase of the yield of the fully hydrogenated product for hindered substrates, we conducted catalytic hydrogenations of 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene under 60 psi of H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at 50&deg; C. Since Crabtree&apos;s catalyst is not very thermally stable, it may not be surprising that its activity was drastically decreased when the catalytic reaction was conducted under 60 psi at 50&deg; C. Catalyst degradation is presumably favored at elevated temperatures and conversion into a catalytically inactive species results in poor or no olefin hydrogenation. A poor 34% yield of methylcyclohexane was obtained after 7 h (entry 7) when using 1. In contrast, the activity of 2 is significantly improved under these conditions. In fact, a complete conversion to the fully hydrogenated product was obtained within 7 h (entry 8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In summary, a new cationic iridium carbene complex 2 has been prepared and found to be effective in the hydrogenation of simple olefins. Although it is less efficient than Crabtree&apos;s catalyst at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of hydrogen, (which may be related to the larger steric bulk of SIMes in 2 compared to that of PCy<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>in 1), it displayed a higher activity under a mild pressure of hydrogen at 50&deg; C. This is in contrast to the catalytic property of 1, which is significantly less active under the same conditions. The difference in activity can be attributed to the presence of the bulky N-heterocyclic carbene ligand in 2 which results in an improved thermal stability. Investigations into the use of the new catalyst to a variety of substrates and synthesis of a family of nucleophilic carbene bearing iridium complexes are ongoing. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The hydrogenation experiments. A solution of 0.01 mmol of catalyst, 1.0 mmol of olefin in 5 mL of dichloromethane was loaded into a 50 ML scintillation vial equipped with a screw cap and septum inside a glove box. The vial was then purged with hydrogen from a Schlenk line for 1 min. The reaction was allowed to stir under atmospheric pressure of hydrogen and the product ratio was monitored by GC. In some of the cases, the catalytic solution was loaded into a 100 mL Fisher-Porter pressure bottle, which was purged with hydrogen three times and then pressurized with 60 psi of hydrogen. The reaction was allowed to stir in an oil bath at 50&deg; C. for 7 h. The reaction flask was cooled to room temperature. The pressure was then carefully discharged and product ratios were determined by gas chromatography. Reported experimental yields are the average of two runs. </paragraph>

13864663,20131017,20130275082,Methods and Apparatus for Jammable HCI Interfaces,"In exemplary implementations of this invention, a jammable structure functions as an HCI interface. A user provides input by changing the shape of a flexible layer of the jammable structure (e.g., by pressing against it or stretching, twisting or bending it) and receives haptic feedback (e.g., varying stiffness). Sensors are used to determine the shape of the flexible layer. The sensors output data that is indicative of electromagnetic waves that have traveled through the jammable media or of electrical or magnetic phenomena that are produced by the waves. For example, visible or infrared light may be shone through a transparent jammable media to the flexible layer and reflect back to a camera. The media may comprise granular particles (e.g., glass beads) and a liquid (e.g., oil) with matching indices of refraction. Or capacitive sensing may be used to detect the shape of the flexible layer.",[Sean Follmer][Daniel Leithinger][Hiroshi Ishii][Alex Olwal],[Massachusetts Institute of Technology],"This application is a non-provisional of, and claims the benefit of the filing date of, U.S. Provisional Application Ser.

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a gas chromatographic method and apparatus which uses a primary separation column and parallel secondary separation columns to separate volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a sample at different times as a result of the sample flowing through the columns. In particular, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus which uses a valve which accumulates a sample from the primary column for transfer to the secondary columns in parallel. The primary column has a smaller fluid flow capacity than the combined fluid capacities of the secondary columns. In this manner, the chromatographic separations of the primary and secondary columns are matched to provide the best available separation of compounds in the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key components in industrial, environmental, and medical samples. Air, water soil, and body fluids often contain hundreds of VOCs (Helmig, D., et al., <highlight><italic>Chemosphere </italic></highlight>38 2163-2187 (1999); and Phillips, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Chromatogr. B </italic></highlight>729 75-88 (1999)) with concentrations in the part-per-trillion to part-per-million range (Helmig, D., et al., <highlight><italic>Chemosphere </italic></highlight>38 2163-2187 (1999); and Phillips, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Journal of Chromatography B </italic></highlight>729 75-88 (1999)) Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is conventionally used to characterize complex VOC mixtures. However, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC&times;GC) has recently emerged as an alternative to GC/MS (Liu, Z. Y., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. Sci </italic></highlight>29 227-231 (1991); Beens, J., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. A </italic></highlight>919 127-132 (2001); Bruckner, C. A., et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>70 2796-2804 (1998); Frysinger, G. S., et al., <highlight><italic>J. High Res. Chrom. </italic></highlight>22 195-200 (1999); Kinghorn, R. M., et al., High Res. Chrom. 21 620-622 (1998); and Lewis, A. C., et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>405 778-781 (2000)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> GC/MS instruments use gas chromatography to separate mixtures into individual components and mass spectrometry to detect and identify each component. Chromatographic separation is the rate-limiting step: complex samples often require more than 30 minutes to resolve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Chromatography is an analytical method for the separation and identification of chemical compounds from mixtures. Gas chromatography is a particularly well-known discipline of this science which, when used in combination with quantitative instrumentation (for example GC-IR, GC-UV, GC-MS), provides the user with reliable results. However, in an attempt to find lower cost methods and decrease sample testing time, a variety of sources have taught the technique of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography as a high resolution alternative to the previously known methods. In comprehensive two-dimensional GC, a sample is first injected into and separated by a primary column. Thereafter, at least a portion of the separated sample is collected and injected into a secondary column for further separation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC&times;GC) is a high resolution alternative to GC/MS. GC&times;GC has been developed in a limited number of laboratories over the past 10 years (Phillips, J. B., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. A. </italic></highlight>856 331-347 (1999); and Bertsch, W., <highlight><italic>J. High Resol. Chromatogr. </italic></highlight>23 167-181 (2000)). GC&times;GC subjects the entire sample to two serial chromatographic separations. The sample is first partially separated by a primary column. Sample components are collected by a modulator as they leave the primary column and are subsequently injected at regular intervals into a secondary column where they undergo a fast secondary separation. The stationary phases of the primary and secondary columns have different selectivities so that species that co-elute from the primary column can be separated by the secondary column. GC&times;GC frequently produces greater levels of chromatographic separation than GC/MS (Bertsch, W., <highlight><italic>J. High Resol. Chromatogr. </italic></highlight>23 167-181 (2000) and Seeley, J. V., et al., Analytical Chem. 72 4346 (2000)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,196,039 that issued to Phillips et al provides an example of prior art two-dimensional GC. Specifically, Phillips et al disclose a method and apparatus for two-dimensional chromatography wherein a sample is injected and separated in a first column (a first dimension), collected, and then re-injected and separated into a second column (a second dimension) that is in series with the first dimension. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is shown a two-dimensional gas chromatography apparatus having parallel dual secondary columns constructed in accordance with the present invention. Preferably, the apparatus includes an oven <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> leading to a primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides fluid communication between an outlet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the primary column and a secondary inlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The secondary inlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> communicates with a Y union <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having a first <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a second <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> secondary column that are arranged in a parallel relationship. Preferably, the outlets <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the first <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> secondary columns communicate with first <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> flame ionization detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a split inlet having a 20:1 split ratio in 0.05 &mgr;L quantities. The primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably non-polar. For example, in testing, it was found that a 15 m DB-624 capillary column (6% cyanopropylphenyl, 94% dimethyl polysiloxane, 1.4 &mgr;m film thickness), available from J&amp;W Scientific (Folsom, Calif.) was able to perform quite adequately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The split inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows part of the VOC to be vaporized and fed into capillary primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such that 95% is exhausted from the system and 5% goes to the column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The oven <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> heats the sample at an upwards ramping temperature using a heating coil (not shown). This allows for staggered volatilization of the sample. Thus the 20:1 ratio in the Examples. This allows relatively concentrated samples to be tested (10 ppb VOC). Where more dilute VOC are to be tested (i.e. breath samples; 1 ppb VOC) then the ratio can be 1:1, such that 50% is fed to the column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The balance is achieved so as to obtain peak widths which are usable and so that there are separations between the peaks as detected by the flame ionization detectors <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The carrier gas for the VOC is usually H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or He. While H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be explosive in air, it is cheaper. In any event, because of the small size of these gases and low viscosity, high diffusion coefficients and flow rates can be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a high-speed six-port diaphragm valve fitted with a 20 &mgr;L sample loop that collects effluent from the primary column and periodically injects the effluent into the secondary columns as described below. One particular example of a diaphragm valve used in the present invention is available from Valco (Houston, Tex.) (Model No. DV22-2116). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A secondary inlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends from the valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and terminates at a Y union <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Extending from each arm <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the Y union <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are the first <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and second <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> secondary columns. Preferably, these secondary columns are polar and have selectivities that differ between themselves and the primary column. One example particular of suitable first secondary column is a 5 m DB-Wax column (polyethylene glycol, 0.25 &mgr;m film thickness) available from J&amp;W Scientific. Likewise, a suitable example of a second secondary column is a 5 m DB-210 column (trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane, 0.50 &mgr;m film thickness), which is also available from J&amp;W Scientific. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Preferably, each of the secondary columns communicates with a separate flame ionization detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. However, other types of detectors are well known in the art and may be easily interchanged with flame detectors <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The dual secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the above-described apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> permit comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography that produces a pair of two-dimensional chromatographs in a single run. Using the above-described apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a sample is first injected into the split inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and communicated into the primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, where it is separated into a first dimension. Preferably, ultra high purity hydrogen is used as a carrier in both the primary <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and secondary columns. Additionally, the preferred flow of the sample through the primary column is 0.75 ml per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> From the primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the sample enters the diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where it is subsequently injected into the secondary inlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and partitioned at the Y union <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> into the parallel secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Notably, the preferred flow of the sample through the secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is 20 ml/min. Effluent from the secondary columns is monitored by a flame ionization detector <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The use of dual secondary columns increases resolution and qualitative information supplied by traditional comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic analysis. Furthermore, using different secondary columns it should be appreciated that the range, resolution and scope of the present invention may be greatly expanded. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> This Example examines the use of a nonpolar primary column coupled to two polar secondary columns in the instrument of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. One secondary column interacts strongly with compounds possessing high levels of hydrogen bond acidity, whereas the other secondary column interacts strongly with dipolar compounds. Differential flow modulation has been used to couple the primary column to the secondary columns. A collection of 130 volatile organic compounds were analyzed using the GC&times;2GC instrument. The observed secondary retention times form distinct clusters according to the functional groups present and greatly facilitate compound identification. The data demonstrate that the dual secondary column configuration increases separation efficiency for mixtures containing organic compounds with electronegative functional groups (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and oxygen containing compounds). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> This example uses the GC&times;2GC instrument described previously with the six-port diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> fitted with a sample loop to couple the primary <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This technique, called differential flow modulation GC&times;GC, provides high-speed, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity while maintaining a simple experimental design. Differential flow modulation passes 90% of the effluent exiting the primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Although this is not 100% transfer (like that produced by most thermal modulation systems), the technique is classified as a comprehensive technique because the primary column effluent is sampled throughout a chromatographic run at a frequency (1 Hz) high enough to retain the chromatographic separation produced by the primary column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Differential flow modulation was used to create a GC&times;GC instrument that splits the effluent leaving the diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into two secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The resulting technique, dual-secondary column comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC&times;2GC), produces a pair of two-dimensional chromatograms in a single run. This example shows the use of a 6% cyanopropylphenyl, 94% dimethyl polysiloxane primary column coupled to a polyethylene glycol secondary column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane secondary column <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Each column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has a unique selectivity. The primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> interacts largely through dispersive forces, whereas the polyethylene glycol column exhibits strong hydrogen bonding interactions and the trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane column exhibits strong dipole-dipole interactions (Li, J., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. </italic></highlight>517 103 (1990)). This work evaluates the efficacy of using GC&times;2GC to analyze complex VOC mixtures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, Conn., USA) Autosystem XL gas chromatograph with electronic pneumatics and dual flame-ionization detectors (FIDs) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> was used as the experimental platform. Two alterations were made to the gas chromatograph: the 6-port diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (described below) was mounted in the location normally reserved for a second sample inlet, and a 100 nF filtering capacitor on each FID electrometer was replaced by an 8 nF capacitor. The filtering capacitor is used for amplification of the peaks. With the 100 nf capacitor, the peak widths are 1 second to 10 seconds. With the nf capacitor, the peak widths are 50 milliseconds wide. In some instances the amplifier capacitor may not be necessary with very low concentration samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Neat VOC mixtures were injected into the primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through a split inlet (20:1 split ratio) in 0.05 &mgr;L quantities. The oven temperature in inlet <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was ramped according to the following program: 40&deg; C. for 0.4 min, ramp to 60&deg; C. at 40 K min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, ramp to 120&deg; C. at 30 K min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, ramp to 200&deg; C. at 22.5 K min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, hold for 1.0 min. All capillary columns <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> were purchased from J &amp; W Scientific (Folsom, Calif., USA). A 15 m&times;250 &mgr;m DB-624 capillary column (6% cyanopropylphenyl, 94% dimethyl polysiloxane, 1.4 &mgr;m film thickness) was used as the primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A 5 m&times;250 &mgr;m DB-Wax column (polyethylene glycol, 0.25 &mgr;m film thickness) and a 5 m&times;250 &mgr;m DB-210 column (trifluoropropyl-methyl polysiloxane, 0.50 &mgr;m film thickness) were used as the secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Ultra-high purity hydrogen was used as the carrier gas in the primary and secondary columns. The primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> flow was 0.75 mL min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, and the flow leading to the secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> was 20.0 mL min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. At 40&deg; C., the inlet pressure of the secondary columns was 76 kPA gauge. The high-speed 6-port diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (DV22-2116, Valco, Houston, Tex., USA) fitted with a 20 &mgr;L sample loop was used to collect effluent from the primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and periodically inject the effluent into the secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> temperature was maintained at 130&deg; C. Secondary injections were performed at a frequency of 1 Hz; the sample loop in valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> was filled with primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> effluent for 0.9 s and flushed for 0.1 s into a short transfer line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> leading to the secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The 20.0 mL min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>flow passing through the transfer line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> was split between the two secondary columns with a fused silica &ldquo;Y&rdquo; union <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Measurements of the flow exiting from each secondary column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> indicated that the flow was evenly split to within 2%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Effluent from each secondary column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> was monitored by a flame-ionization detector <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. FID signals were monitored at 200 Hz by an Apple Macintosh computer equipped with a data acquisition board and custom software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A collection of 130 VOCs was divided into 20 simple mixtures, each containing 5 to 10 compounds. The GC&times;2GC system was used to analyze the mixtures. Each run produced a pair of FID signal arrays that were converted into 2-dimensional chromatograms as previously described (Seeley, J. V., et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>72 4346 (2000). Retention times, peak areas and peak widths were determined as previously described (Seeley, J. V., et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>72 4346 (2000)) for each 2-dimensional chromatogram using software written in-house. Peaks in the DB-Wax 2-dimensional chromatogram were matched with their respective peaks in the DB-210 2-dimensional chromatogram by correlating primary retention times and peak areas. The observed retention times for the entire set of VOCs are compiled in Table 1.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The primary retention times are the average of the values obtained from the DB-Wax and DB-210 chromatograms. The two values agreed to within 0.1 s. Most of the compounds had DB-Wax and DB-210 secondary retention times between 1.90 s and 2.90 s. The absolute values of the secondary retention times were verified for a selected set of compounds by changing the secondary injection period from 1 s to 3 s. The unretained retention time was approximately 1.8 s for both secondary columns. Peak areas obtained from the DB-210 chromatogram were consistently 3% larger than the DB-Wax peak areas. Peak widths-at-half-maximum along the primary retention time axis were approximately 1.5 s for all the compounds analyzed. Peak widths along the secondary retention axis were dependent upon the secondary retention times. A linear least-squares fit of the DB-Wax peak widths resulted in the following equation:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> where W<highlight><subscript>&frac12;</subscript></highlight> is the width-at-half maximum (in seconds) along the secondary retention axis and t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the secondary retention time. Thus, poorly retained compounds (e.g., alkanes) had widths of approximately 0.040 s, and highly retained compounds (e.g., 1-alcohols) had widths of approximately 0.060 s. A linear least-squares fit to a plot of the DB-210 peak widths-at-half-maximum resulted in the following equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>W</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&frac12;</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.038<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&minus;0.036&emsp;&emsp;(2)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Poorly retained compounds (e.g., alkanes) had widths of approximately 0.046 s, and highly retained compounds (e.g., 2-ketones) had widths of approximately 0.070 s. The 40% larger broadening rate observed for the DB-210 secondary column is most likely a result of the DB-210 stationary phase being twice as thick as the DB-Wax stationary phase (Gaspar, G., et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>50 1512 (1978)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The method used to transform a one-dimensional signal array into a two-dimensional chromatogram (Seeley, J. V., et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>72 4346 (2000)) assumed that all compounds had secondary retention times between 1.90 and 2.90 s. However, several of the VOCs had secondary retention times greater than 2.9 s, but less than 3.9 s. Upon transformation, such compounds appeared as peaks with secondary retention times 1.0 s less (i.e., the secondary injection period) than that their actual value and primary retention times 1.0 s greater than their actual value. Fortunately, the peak width along the secondary retention axis can be used to detect compounds originating from previous injection cycles. For example, methyl benzoate had a primary retention time of 309.3 s, DB-Wax retention time of 3.00 s, and a DB-210 retention time of 2.73 s. Thus, the DB-210 2-dimensional chromatogram had the methyl benzoate peak in the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; position because the secondary retention time was between 1.90 and 2.90 s. In contrast, the DB-Wax 2-dimensional chromatogram showed the methyl benzoate peak at a primary retention time of 310.3 s and a secondary retention time of 2.00 s. However, the peak width along the DB-Wax retention time axis was 60% greater than those of nearby peaks. Thus, the peak was determined to be &ldquo;wrapped-around&rdquo; from a previous injection cycle, and 1.0 s was added to the secondary retention time and 1.0 s was subtracted from the primary retention time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> To demonstrate the performance of the GC&times;2GC system, several mixtures were combined to produce a 55-component sample containing the following compounds: C<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>n-alkanes, C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>1-alcohols, C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>2-alcohols, C<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>2-methyl-2-alcohols, C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>and C<highlight><subscript>10 </subscript></highlight>acetates, C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>11 </subscript></highlight>aldehydes, C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>8 </subscript></highlight>2-ketones, and C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>10 </subscript></highlight>alkyl aromatics. Compounds within each functional class (e.g., alkanes, 1-alcohols, etc.) differed only by the length of their straight-chain alkyl group. The chromatogram for this mixture is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The data are also represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> as two-dimensional scatter plots organized according to functional group. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> demonstrate the complementary nature of the DB-Wax and DB-210 secondary columns for analyzing the 55-component mixture: The DB-Wax 2-dimensional chromatogram easily distinguishes the alkanes, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, and tertiary alcohols, but the aldehydes, ketones, acetates, and aromatic compounds all display similar secondary retention times. The DB-210 2-dimensional chromatogram easily distinguishes the alkanes, acetates, aldehydes, and ketones, but the primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, and aromatic compounds display similar secondary retention times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The approximate secondary retention times observed for a wide variety of compound classes is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Compounds that are nonpolar and not highly polarizable (e.g., alkanes, monounsaturated hydrocarbons, and saturated cyclic hydrocarbons) have minimal retention on both columns. Highly polarizable compounds having neither large dipole moments nor hydrogen bonding functional groups (e.g., dienes, unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons, and aromatic compounds) display moderate retention on both secondary columns. Compounds with high levels of hydrogen bond acidity but moderate dipole moments (e.g., primary and secondary alcohols) have high retention on the DB-Wax column and moderate retention on the DB-210 column. Compounds with large dipole moments but with low hydrogen bond acidity (e.g., ketones and aldehydes) display high retention on the DB-210 column and moderate retention on the DB-Wax column. High levels of retention is observed on both secondary columns for compounds that are both highly polarizable and have large dipole moments (e.g, oxygenated aromatics). All of these observations are in agreement with the established selectivities of the DB-624, DB-Wax, and DB-210 stationary phases (Li, J., eta l., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. </italic></highlight>517 103 (1990)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a scatter plot of the secondary retention times obtained for the 130 VOCs. The compounds have been categorized as either hydrocarbons or compounds containing one or more electronegative atoms (O, N, or Cl). Hydrocarbons have DB-210 secondary retention times that are highly correlated with their DB-Wax retention times. A linear fit to the hydrocarbon data produces a correlation coefficient of 0.942, indicating that any separation or qualitative information provided by the DB-210 column is largely redundant with that produced by the DB-Wax column. This is not surprising, as the retention of hydrocarbons on standard liquid stationary phases is primarily dictated by size and polarizability, and not by hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole interactions (Abraham, M. H., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. </italic></highlight>2 1777 (1994)). Thus, the data generated by the dual secondary column configuration should aid in the identification of VOCs containing electronegative functional groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The measured retention times and peak widths were used to compare the separation efficiency of single-column GC analysis, GC&times;GC analysis, and GC&times;2GC analysis for the compounds and conditions of this study. A pair of compounds was classified as unresolved by the primary column if the calculated value of primary column resolution was less than 1.0. Primary column resolution, R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, was calculated (Giddings, J. C., <highlight><italic>Unified Separation Science. </italic></highlight>J.

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> where &Dgr;t<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the difference in secondary retention times, and &lt;w<highlight><subscript>&frac12;</subscript></highlight>&gt;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is the average width-at-half maximum along the secondary retention axis. Equations (1) and (2) were used to calculate secondary peak widths for the DB-624/DB-Wax configuration and DB-624/DB-210 configuration, respectively. Compounds with a secondary retention time greater than 2.9 s had 1.0 s added to their primary retention time and 1.0 s subtracted from their secondary retention time, thus placing the peak in the experimentally observed position. For the DB-624/DB-Wax configuration, 34 of the 8385 possible compound pairs produce overlapping peaks and 46 of the 130 compounds are members of at least one overlapping pair. Thus, if all 130 VOCs were injected at the same time, 84 compounds would be predicted to be resolved in the DB-624/DB-Wax chromatogram. For the DB-624/DB-210 configuration, 29 of the 8385 possible pairs produce overlapping peaks and 45 of the 130 compounds are members of at least one overlapping pair. Thus, if all 130 VOCs were injected at the same time, 85 compounds would be predicted to be resolved in the DB-624/DB-210 chromatogram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Compounds were classified as unresolved by GC&times;2GC analysis if they were unresolved in both two-dimensional chromatograms. Under this assumption, only 6 of the 8385 possible pairs are unresolved. When considering mixtures with more than two compounds, it is important to note that the interfering compounds need not be the same. For example, compound A can be pair-wise resolved by GC&times;2GC with both compound B and compound C, but be unresolved when a mixture of A, B, and C is examined. This is possible if A overlaps with B in one chromatogram and A overlaps with C in the other chromatogram. The simulation results show that 21 of the 130 compounds are members of overlapping pairs in both column configurations. Thus, if all 130 VOCs were injected at the same time, 109 compounds would be predicted to be resolved by GC&times;2GC analysis (i.e., the number of unresolved compounds decreases by a factor of two when going from GC&times;GC analysis to GC&times;2GC analysis). These results indicate that in addition to increased qualitative information, GC&times;2GC analysis can increase separation efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The results demonstrate that dual secondary columns can increase the resolution and qualitative information supplied by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic analysis. The largest improvement in performance is expected for mixtures containing compounds with a wide range of dipole moments and hydrogen bond acidities. Thus, our GC&times;2GC configuration is well suited for analyzing samples containing oxidized or halogenated compounds (such as environmental and biomedical samples) (Helmig, D., et al., <highlight><italic>Chemosphere </italic></highlight>38 2163 (1999); Phillips, M., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. B </italic></highlight>729 75 (1999); and Helmig, J., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Geophys. Res. </italic></highlight>103 22 (1998)), but not as useful for samples dominated by hydrocarbons (such as most petrochemical samples). It is possible that other column configurations can be developed to extend the scope of GC&times;2GC analysis.

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the following Example the comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatograph with dual secondary columns (GC&times;2GC )as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> was used to characterize gaseous mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Samples were collected on multi-layer sorbent tubes and introduced into the gas chromatograph using a thermal desorption apparatus. Differential flow modulation by sample accumulation was used to couple the primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Each GC&times;2GC analysis produced a pair of two-dimensional gas chromatograms. The chromatograms provided complementary information due to the unique selectivities of the secondary columns. The additional information was especially useful in separating and identifying oxygenated and aromatic compounds. Samples of outdoor air, indoor air, and exhaled breath were analyzed with the GC&times;2GC system. More than 100 volatile organic compounds could be separated in less than 10 minutes. The identities of approximately 50 peaks were determined for each sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The following example examined the use of a non-polar primary column, a polyethylene glycol secondary column, and a trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane secondary column. Each column has a unique selectivity. The primary column interacts largely through dispersive forces, the polyethylene glycol column exhibits strong hydrogen bonding interactions, and the trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane column exhibits strong dipole-dipole interactions (Li, J. J., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. </italic></highlight>517 103 (1990)). Mixtures containing compounds with a wide range of dipole moments and hydrogen bond acidities such as alcohols, ketones, and chlorinated compounds were separated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The GC&times;2GC of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> was used to analyze indoor air, outdoor air, and exhaled breath. Such samples are known to contain numerous VOCs with a wide variety of functional groups (Helmig, D., et al., <highlight><italic>Chemosphere </italic></highlight>38 2163-2187 (1999); Phillips, M., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. B </italic></highlight>729 75-88 (1999); Lewis, A. C., et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>405 778-781 (2000); and Helmig, D., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Geophys. Res. </italic></highlight>103 22397-22414 (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The oven temperature was ramped according to the following program: 40&deg; C. for 0.50 min, ramp to 95&deg; C. at 33&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, ramp to 140&deg; C. at 23.7&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, ramp to 200&deg; C. at 16.5&deg; C. min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, hold for 1.00 min. All capillary columns were purchased from J&amp;W Scientific. The primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> was a 15 m&times;250 &mgr;m DB-624 capillary column (6% cyanopropylphenyl, 94% dimethyl polysiloxane, 1.4 &mgr;m film thickness) . The secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> were a 5 m&times;250 &mgr;m DB-Wax capillary column (polyethylene glycol, 0.25 &mgr;m film thickness) and a 5 m&times;250 &mgr;m DB-210 capillary column (trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane, 0.50 &mgr;m film thickness). Ultra-high purity hydrogen was used as the carrier gas in the primary <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> flow was approximately 0.75 ml min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>, and the flow leading to the secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> was 20.0 ml min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The high-speed 6-port diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> fitted with a 20 &mgr;L sample loop was used to collect effluent from the primary column and periodically inject it into the secondary columns. Secondary injections were performed at a frequency of 1 Hz: the sample loop was filled with primary column <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> effluent for 0.9 s and flushed for 0.1 s into a short transfer line leading to the secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The 20.0 ml min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>flow passing through the transfer line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> was split between the two secondary columns <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with a fused silica &ldquo;Y&rdquo; union <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Effluent from each secondary column <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> was monitored by a flame-ionization detector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Gaseous samples were collected on multi-layer sorbent tubes containing 200 mg of Carbotrap C, 200 mg of Carbotrap, and 100 mg Carbosieve adsorbents. Similar sampling tubes have been shown to effectively trap VOCs within the volatility range of C<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>15 </subscript></highlight>alkanes (Helmig, D., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Geophys. Res. </italic></highlight>103 22397-22414 (1998)). Gaseous VOCs were collected by drawing air through sorbent tubes at 100 ml min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. Sorbent tubes were heated to 45&deg; C. during sampling to reduce water accumulation. Air samples were drawn directly through the tubes for 30 min. Exhaled breath samples were collected in 2-L tedlar bags, then drawn through the sorbent tubes for 15 min. VOCs collected on the sorbent tubes were injected into the GC&times;2GC system with a Perkin-Elmer ATD 400 thermal desorption unit. The split flows on the ATD were adjusted such that 33% of the desorbed VOCs were transferred to the GC&times;2GC system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The quantitative performance of the ATD/GC&times;2GC system was evaluated by analyzing sorbent tubes containing known amounts of toluene. A dilution system containing a toluene permeation tube was used to make gaseous standards. Seven sorbent tubes were loaded with 3.0 ng to 10.0 ng of toluene. The tubes were analyzed with the ATD/GC&times;2GC system. Peak areas determined from the DB-210 chromatogram were consistently 3% larger than the areas determined from the DB-Wax chromatogram. A plot of toluene peak area versus the mass of toluene displayed an excellent linear correlation (R<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;0.999). A 0.3 ng detection limit for toluene was calculated from the regression parameters (Felinger, A., <highlight><italic>Data Analysis and Signal Processing in Chromatography, </italic></highlight>Elsevier: Amsterdam (1998)). Thus, it was estimated that the ATD/GC&times;2GC system can detect toluene at concentrations down to approximately 20 parts-per-trillion when 3.0 L of air is sampled. This experiment was repeated for hexane, and similar results were observed. The reproducibility of the ATD/GC&times;2GC system was tested by analyzing six different sorbent tubes loaded with 6.0 ng of toluene. The area of the resulting toluene peaks had a relative standard deviation of 3%. This RSD is similar to values previously reported for conventional GC/FID analysis of air samples collected on sorbent tubes (Woolfenden, E., <highlight><italic>J. Air Waste Manage. </italic></highlight>47 20-36 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The GC&times;2GC retention times of over 150 volatile organic compounds were determined. As expected, primary retention is largely determined by compound size, whereas secondary retention times are dictated by functional group. The secondary retention times observed with the ATD/GC&times;2GC for several functional group classes are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The DB-Wax secondary column displays high levels of retention for compounds with large hydrogen bonding acidities (such as alcohols) and the DB-210 column displays high levels of retention for compounds with large dipole moments (such as carbonyls). The dual secondary column configuration is particularly well suited for differentiating oxygenated compounds and aromatic compounds: Ketones, aldehydes, esters, and aromatics all have similar secondary retention on the DB-Wax column, but vastly different retention on the DB-210 column. In contrast, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols, and aromatics have similar DB-210 retention but vastly different DB-Wax retention times. All of these compound classes are known to be important constituents in air and in breath (Phillips, M., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogra. B </italic></highlight>729 75-88 (1999); and Helmig, D., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Geophys. Res. </italic></highlight>103 22397-22414 (1998)). Table 2 contains a list of compounds that have been identified in our outdoor air, indoor air, and breath chromatograms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> contains a set of 2-D chromatograms typical of those obtained for outdoor air in suburban and rural locations. The chromatograms are displayed with a full-scale signal intensity of 250 (arbitrary units). The peaks with greatest intensity appear to be elongated because they are off-scale for the chosen plotting parameters (e.g., toluene has a maximum peak height of 900 but the full-scale signal intensity is 250). Over 80 peaks are observed in each chromatogram. Several of the major peaks are labeled in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The largest peaks represent compounds with concentrations near 1 part-per-billion. The main VOCs present are saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, and aldehydes. The DB-Wax 2-D chromatogram produces a distinct band of peaks with secondary retention times near 2.0 s. These peaks originate from saturated and monounsaturated hydrocarbons with carbon numbers ranging from 4 to 14. A second peak band is observed at a secondary retention time of approximately 2.35 s. These peaks originate from aromatic hydrocarbons, saturated ketones, and saturated aldehydes. The DB-210 chromatogram produces a distinct band of saturated and monounsaturated hydrocarbon peaks with low secondary retention (approximately 2.15 s). In contrast to the DB-Wax chromatogram, the aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, and aldehydes have significantly different secondary retention times in the DB-210 chromatogram. Thus, several sets of compounds that overlap in the DB-Wax chromatogram can be fully resolved in the DB-210 chromatogram (e.g., acetone and propanol). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> contains a set of 2-D chromatograms obtained form air in the chemical stockroom at Oakland University, Rochester, Mich. The full-scale intensity is 500. As expected, the chromatograms contain a multitude of high intensity peaks. The GC&times;2GC system can fully separate over 100 peaks; however, some regions of the chromatogram are particularly congested (such as near a primary retention time of 140 s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> contains a set of 2-D chromatograms obtained from the breath of a healthy non-smoking individual. The full-scale signal intensity is 20,000 (i.e., a factor of 20 greater than that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Acetone and isoprene were observed in quantities greater than 20 ppb and produced off-scale peaks. Phenol was observed at a primary retention time of 321 s. This compound is highly retained by the DB-Wax column (8.06 secondary retention time). In fact the peak is wrapped-around from several previous secondary injection cycles. In contrast, phenol is only moderately retained by the DB-210 column (2.40 s secondary retention time). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> contains the same chromatograms shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, but with a full-scale signal intensity of 500. Nearly 100 peaks are fully resolved in the breath chromatograms. The ability of the DB-Wax column to separate alcohols is demonstrated in the clear distinction of methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, whereas the DB-210 column is useful at separating the numerous ketones and aldehydes found in breath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The results indicate that GC&times;2GC is particularly useful in characterizing the VOCs found in indoor air, outdoor air, and breath. It is important to note that the separations described here were performed in approximately 15% of the time normally required to analyze similar samples with GC/MS (Phillips, M., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Chromatogr. B </italic></highlight>729 75-88 (1999); and Helmig, D., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Geophys. Res. </italic></highlight>103 22397-22414 (1998)).

<heading lvl="1">Example 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> This Example relates to the application of a dual-secondary column comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatograph (GC&times;2GC) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to quantitate chemical exposure levels. GC&times;2GC provides high resolution, high sensitivity, and short analysis times for a fraction of the cost of conventional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques. A retention database is developed to allow peaks to be identified under a wide range of chromatographic conditions. Volatile organic compound profiles of breath are obtained with the GC&times;2GC system. The data is analyzed to determine if this novel technique can be used to detect and quantitate the levels of exposure to cigarette smoke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> VOC levels in breath may also be a sensitive marker for exposure to other hazardous pollutants: Mathews, et al (Mathews, J. M., et al., Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 146, 255-260 (1997)) have recently shown that rats exposed to trans-1,2-dichloroethylene exhibited greater than 100% increases in breath acetone, hexane, and 2-butanone. Elevated levels were maintained for several hours after exposure. Similar increases in breath VOCs have been observed for individuals exposed to cigarette smoke (Euler, D. E., et al., <highlight><italic>Clinical Chemistry </italic></highlight>42, 303-308 (1996); and Lin, Y., et al., Clinical Chemistry, 41, 1028-1032 (1995)). Lipid peroxidation brought on by oxidant stress has been cited as the cause for increases of VOC production (Risby, T. H., et al., <highlight><italic>Free Radical Biology and Medicine, </italic></highlight>27, 1182-1192 (1999); and Steinberg, F. M., et al., <highlight><italic>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, </italic></highlight>69, 319-327 (1999)). The non-invasive nature of breath VOC analysis makes it a promising candidate for quantitative exposure assessment. Unfortunately, conventional GC/MS breath analysis is very time consuming; a single breath assay requires the analysis of a breath sample and a room air sample, with each taking approximately 1 hour to complete (Phillips, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Journal of Chromatography B, </italic></highlight>729, 75-88 (1999)). This greatly limits the quantity of samples that can be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> GC&times;2GC methods are used for analyzing VOCs in air, water, and breath. In each case, the VOCs are trapped on multi-layer sorbent tubes and then injected into the GC&times;2GC system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with a Perkin-Elmer ATD 400 thermal desorption unit. Atmospheric samples are collected by pulling air directly through the sorbent tube. Aqueous samples are analyzed by purging with inert gas and collecting the VOCs in a sorbent tube. Breath samples are collected in Tedlar bags then passed through a sorbent tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The data acquisition and analysis software is provided with (Helmig, D., et al., <highlight><italic>Journal of Geophysical Research, </italic></highlight>103, 22397-22414 (1998)) multiple run automation that allows the thermal desorption unit to be loaded with up to 50 samples and run overnight, (Phillips, M., et al., <highlight><italic>Journal of Chromatography B, </italic></highlight>729, 75-88 (1999)) sample data entry that allows sample collection data to be merged with the chromatographic data, and (Phillips, J. B., et al., <highlight><italic>Journal of Chromatography A, </italic></highlight>856, 331-347 (1999)) standardized data output that allows the chromatographic data to be imported into pattern recognition software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A portable breath collection apparatus (BCA) produced by Menssana Research is used (Phillips, M., <highlight><italic>Analytical Biochemistry </italic></highlight>247, 272-278 (1997)). The BCA was developed by Michael Phillips over the last 10 years and is now being used in clinical studies throughout the United States and Europe. This system allows breath samples to be collected easily. Subjects breathe into the BCA via a disposable mouth piece while the VOCs are trapped in a heated sorbent tube. The BCA is constructed so that alveolar breath is sampled and not dead space breath. After sample acquisition, the sorbent tubes can be stored for weeks without significant artifact formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> While GC&times;2GC produces greater separation efficiencies than GC/MS, unknown identification is much more advanced on GC/MS systems. The mass spectrum of an unknown compound can be compared to a library of 100,000 mas spectra. Fully resolved, high-intensity chromatographic peaks can be identified with high levels of confidence. On the other hand, if two components elute simultaneously they produce an overlapped spectrum that results in erroneous matches. Unknown identification in GC&times;2GC is done by the peak position in the 2 D chromatogram. As GC&times;2GC is just beginning to be explored, extensive chromatographic libraries do not exist. Conclusive matching requires standard mixtures are analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Artificial neural networks are used to predict retention times. Neural networks have previously been shown to approximate nonlinear multivariable functions with high accuracy (Gasteiger, J., et al., <highlight><italic>Angew. Chem. </italic></highlight>105, 510 (1993)). Their results indicate that standard 1-dimensional retention time libraries for each of the three columns can be used to predict primary retention time to within 3 s and the secondary retention times to within 0.02 s. This level of accuracy allows a short list of possible matches to be generated for each unknown peak. The neural network/1-D library approach is preferable to simply creating a library of 2-D chromatograms as it can be used to predict retention times under a wide range of experimental conditions (e.g., column dimensions, temperature programs, flow-rates, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Comprehensive breath measurements of individuals with varying levels of exposure to cigarette smoke are made. Cigarette smoke has been shown to increase breath VOCs through direct exposure to VOCs (Jordan, A., et al., <highlight><italic>International Journal of mass Spectrometry and Ion Processes, </italic></highlight>148, L1-L3 (1995)) and by promoting the endogenous production of VOCs (Lin, Y., et al., <highlight><italic>Clinical Chemistry </italic></highlight>41, 1028-1032 (1995); Risby, T. H., et al., <highlight><italic>Free Radical Biology and Medicine </italic></highlight>27, 1182-1192 (1999); and Steinberg, F. M., et al., <highlight><italic>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition </italic></highlight>69, 319-327 (1999)). Approximately 50 volunteers are recruited from each of the following groups: (1) non-smokers who live and work in essentially smoke-free environments, (2) heavy smokers who smoke over 20 cigarettes per day, and (3) passive smokers, non-smokers who are exposed to smokers at work and/or reside with at least one heavy smoker. The oxidant status of each individual is determined by measuring the isoprostane levels in urine and plasma. Isoprostanes are known to increase dramatically under conditions of oxidative stress (Roberts, L. J., et al., <highlight><italic>Free Radical Biology and Medicine </italic></highlight>28, 505-513 (2000)). It is necessary to know the oxidant stress status of the individuals as lipid peroxidation is known to produce many VOCs, including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones (Frankel, E. N. , <highlight><italic>Lipid Oxidation; </italic></highlight>Oily Press: Dundee (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Breath compounds that correlate with the exposure categories and the isoprostane measurements are searched. Statistical algorithms, such as forward stepwise discriminant analysis (Phillips, M., et al., &ldquo;Volatile organic compounds in breath as markers of lung cancer: a cross-sectional study, <highlight><italic>Lancet, </italic></highlight>353, 1930-1933 (1999)), are used to identify the VOCs that are the best markers of exposure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A diverse pool of individuals is obtained. It may be necessary to travel to selected locations to further promote the study. Interested individuals are provided with information regarding the procedures to be employed. After obtaining informed participants are asked to complete a questionnaire. Each questionnaire includes a cover page requesting the name and telephone number of the respondent that can be conveniently removed after coding. The questionnaire is a modified form of one which has been used for over 20 years by the Oakland University&apos;s Meadow Brook Health Enhancement Institute. Each questionnaire solicits information regarding age, sex, race, and medical history. It also solicits information regarding dietary habits, exercise regimen, smoking history, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, passive smoking, alcohol consumption, and medications taken (including antioxidant vitamins). Volunteers are paid for their initial responses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Participants are selected based on questionnaire responses. The goal is to assemble a diverse distribution of age and sex matched participants. Volunteers selected for further participation in this study are contacted by telephone and scheduled for specimen collection. They are reminded of the purpose of the study and their right to withdraw at anytime. Individuals expecting to continue are instructed to refrain from eating or smoking for 12 hours prior to sample collection. The questionnaire responses are evaluated by designating three levels (low, medium, high) for several parameters, including smoking, exercise, anti-oxidant vitamin supplementation, and age. These parameters are then assigned a letter code, and the levels for each parameter code transferred to a table containing randomly assigned donor codes. After encoding, the cover sheet of the questionnaires, containing the names of volunteers, are removed and destroyed. Sample donors will be paid $25. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Breath: Volunteers are fitted with a nose clip and instructed to breathe into the breath collection apparatus for 5 minutes. 10 L of alveolar breath VOCs is collected on a sorbent tube. A room air sample is collected simultaneously on a second sorbent tube. Upon completion of breath sampling, each tube is placed in a labeled, hermetically-sealed container. The GC&times;2GC system is used to analyze the breath and air samples. An internal standard is added to each tube. Each chromatographic peak is integrated and tabulated. The alveolar gradient of each compound is calculated by subtracting the relative peak area of the room air sample from the relative peak area of the breath sample. The concentrations of selected compounds are determined from standard calibration curves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Blood: 50 cc of peripheral blood is obtained by venipuncture into a Vacutainer containing EDTA as an anticoagulant, with precautions to avoid transmission of blood borne pathogens. Following low speed centrifugation, the plasma is separated and aliquoted. A known quantity of isoprostane is added to two fractions (spiked samples) to control for potential losses during extraction. Aliquots of blood is treated with 5 mg lipase obtained from the yeast, <highlight><italic>Candida cylindraccae, </italic></highlight>at 37&deg; C. for 1 hr to hydrolyze esterified isoprostanes. Multiple coded aliquots are then frozen at &minus;80&deg; C. for subsequent analyses. This minimizes differences in isoprostane levels that can result from ex vivo peroxidation in plasma samples. The levels of free and total isoprostanes are determined using the OBR commercial ELISA kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Urine: Participants donate a urine sample during their visit to the collection facility. The sample is marked with a coded label. To normalize for variations in urinary output, creatinine levels in urine is measured using a calorimetric procedure described previously (19). Urinary cotinine is also measured using a standard calorimetric method (20) to provide a quantitative measure of nicotine metabolism and to confirm levels of smoking reported on questionnaires. The levels of free and total isoprostanes are determined using the OBR commercial ELISA kit. The results are normalized to the creatinine level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The dual secondary columns can be fed by other standard switching means such as thermal modulation of the sample. Obviously there can be more than two secondary columns which are fed from a common source. All of these variations will produce the improved resolution and compound resolution of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> While the present invention is described herein with reference to illustrated embodiments, it should be understood that the invention is not limited hereto. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings herein will recognize additional modifications and embodiments within the scope thereof. Therefore, the present invention is limited only by the claims attached herein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Crystals of doped semiconductors and alloys are grown in a Czochralski process utilizing a single crucible. An upper heater around the crucible applies heat to an upper portion of the crucible while a lower heater below the upper heater applies heat to a lower portion of the crucible independently of the upper heater. A solid feed material in a lower portion of the crucible is maintained by the lower heater at a temperature below the melting point of the feed material, while the upper heater maintains an upper portion of the crucible at a higher temperature to provide a melt of the feed material in the upper portion of the crucible. A crystal grown from a seed introduced into the melt is drawn upwardly from the melt, and through a liquid encapsulant layer for a liquid encapsulated Czochralski process, and the crucible is displaced relative to the upper and lower heaters to bring additional portions of the solid feed material into the higher temperature region of the upper heater to replenish the melt drawn out with the formed crystal, avoiding spatial segregation of dopants or of constituents of an alloy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention pertains to the field of crystal growth by the Czochralski process and particularly to the growth of crystals by the liquid encapsulated Czochralski process. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Compositionally uniform semiconductor crystals are required for the manufacturing of a variety of devices, including integrated circuits, photodetectors, solar cells, thermoelectric devices, x-ray, gamma ray and neutron monochromators, power FETs, diode lasers, infrared detectors, pollution detectors for carbon dioxide and other pollutant gases, etc. Such crystals are often grown with a small amount of an impurity as a dopant, e.g., indium doped gallium arsenide, or as alloys of two or more semiconductors. The crystals must be compositionally homogeneous to be useful. Spatial segregation in the crystal of dopants or alloys would result in variations in the physical properties of the devices made with the crystals, and for the case of alloy crystals, could promote polycrystalline growth or even cracking. For example, GaAs single crystals have been doped with InAs to reduce dislocations, and such crystals are referred to as In-doped GaAs. The effect of segregation coefficient k for InAs in In-doped GaAs is small, from 0.1 to 0.13. Consequently, InAs tends to segregate along a GaAs crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The liquid-encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) process has been the most widely used process to grow GaAs crystals. B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>is typically used as a liquid encapsulant under pressurized Ar to suppress As evaporation from the melt. In order to reduce dopant segregation, efforts have been made to use double-crucible techniques for growing doped GaAs crystals. In a double-crucible process, the crystal is grown from a growth melt held in an inner crucible, and the growth melt is fed with a replenishing melt held in the outer crucible. A high temperature shutter has been used to regulate the flow of the melt from the outer, replenishing crucible into the inner crucible. While such double crucible processes have been successfully utilized for growing uniform silicon crystals, the double crucible technique is less suited to use with crystals requiring liquid encapsulation, such as GaAs. A primary problem is that the liquid encapsulant, e.g., boric oxide for GaAs, tends to plug up the passageway(s) between the inner and outer crucibles. Further, the inner crucible has commonly been prepared from hot pressed BN because the crucible walls need to be very thick to maintain a temperature differential between the inner and outer crucibles. The hot pressed BN is not nearly as clean as the pyrolytic BN crucibles with relatively thin walls that are preferred for growing GaAs crystals. In addition, the two crucibles are commonly quite large and much of the expensive, high-purity charge for crystal growth is left over at the end of a run and consequently wasted. This leftover charge cannot be utilized because of its unknown characteristics, partly due to the contamination from the hot pressed BN crucible, but also because of the way crystals tend to develop a severe segregation during crystal growth, leaving a higher concentration of dopant in the remaining melt. Attempts to utilize double-crucible techniques to grow uniform crystals in In-doped GaAs have been reported but with relatively limited success. See, e.g., H. Okada, et al., J. Crystal Growth, Vol. 82, 1987, pp. 643 et seq.; J. He, et al, J. Crystal Growth, Vol. 208, 2000, pp. 42-48; J. He, et al., J. Crystal Growth, Vol. 211, 2000, pp. 163-168; R. M. Ware, Technical Report ADA 297039, Defense Technical Information Center, Ft. Belvoir, Va., 1995; K. Nakajima, et al., Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings, Vol. 281, 1993, p. 197; K. Nakajima, et al., J. Crystal Growth, Vol. 169, 1996, pp. 217-222. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Lin, et al. (M. H. Lin, et al., J. Crystal Growth, Vol. 193, 1998, pp. 443-445) have reported a reduction in segregation in Czochralski growth of Cd-doped InSb by using an elongated crucible to accommodate a solid feed below the melt. The crystal was pulled from a molten zone on the solid feed. There was no liquid encapsulant covering the melt. A single heater was used and the crucible was raised to cause the solid feed to replenish the melt above it. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, crystals of doped semiconductors or alloys are grown with homogeneous composition along the length of the crystal rod. Spatial segregation of dopants or of one of the constituents of an alloy is essentially avoided, allowing high quality devices to be manufactured from sections of the crystal rod along essentially the entire length of the rod. The invention is particularly well adapted for growing of crystals of materials requiring liquid encapsulation, such as GaAs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Apparatus for crystal growth in accordance with the invention includes a crucible having a preferably flat bottom, a sidewall, and an open top, with an axial height from the open top to the bottom, an upper heater around the crucible to apply heat to an upper portion of the crucible, a lower heater around the crucible below the upper heater to apply heat to a lower portion of the crucible, with the lower heater operable independently of the upper heater so that the heat applied by the upper heater and the lower heater to the crucible can be selected, and heat insulation between the upper and lower heaters. The crucible is supported on an axially advanceable crucible support. In a crystal growth process in accordance with the invention, the crucible is initially filled with a feed charge of the crystal to be grown, for example, GaAs doped with InAs, and the upper and lower heaters are operated to melt the feed material, which is then thoroughly mixed. The feed is then solidified, for example, by turning off the heaters and withdrawing the crucible from the heater region to cause rapid cooling and freezing of the melt. The upper and lower heaters are then turned back on and the crucible advanced into the heater area, with the upper heater raising the temperature of an upper portion of the crucible above the melting point of the feed material while the lower heater maintains a lower portion of the crucible at a temperature which is below the melting point of the feed material. Where needed, a liquid encapsulant (e.g., B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>for use with GaAs) is deposited over the melt layer. To begin crystal growth, a seed crystal pulling rod is advanced through the encapsulant into the melt to initiate crystal growth from the melt onto the seed. The pulling rod with the seed and growing crystal on it is then drawn upwardly and rotated as the crystal grows to pull the growing crystal out of the melt layer and through the liquid encapsulant. As the crystal rod is drawn from the melt, the crucible is raised to bring some of the solid feed material into the heating zone of the upper heater, which raises the temperature of this solid material sufficiently to melt it and thus replenish the melt drawn out by the crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Because only a single crucible is required in the present invention, there are no passageways or orifices to be clogged, and the large majority of the original solid feed material is used in the process so that the amount of waste feed material left at the end of the process is greatly reduced as compared to double crucible processes. The present invention is also well suited to the production of semiconductor alloys, such as alloys of InAs and GaAs. Because of the natural convection occurring in the melt as a result of the temperature gradients in the melt from the top to the bottom of the melt layer, the melt remains well mixed and stratification due to settling of heavier constituents in the melt is avoided. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings, apparatus for homogeneous crystal growth in accordance with the invention is shown generally at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes an outer enclosure or chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of conventional design, within which are mounted an insulating enclosure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, formed, e.g., of an outer layer of graphite felt insulation <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and an inner graphite shield <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, of cylindrical configuration. A crucible support <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (e.g., of graphite) is mounted at the end of a support rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that extends outside of the enclosure <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in a conventional fashion to a conventional driving mechanism <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> that selectively pushes the rod <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and crucible support <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> upwardly at a controlled rate (and which may also rotate the support <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, if desired). A crucible holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted on the crucible support <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and contains within it an axially extending crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which has a preferably flat bottom <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a (typically cylindrical) sidewall <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and an open top end <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The crucible holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be unitary elements, and can be considered together as a crucible. A separate inner crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is desirable for use with materials such as GaAs which may be reactive with or contaminated by conventional crucible materials. For example, the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be formed of a relatively thin walled pyrolytic BN (PBN) material which will be highly stable in contact with a GaAs melt, while the physical support provided by the holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (e.g., of graphite) allows the thickness of the walls of the relatively expensive inner crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be minimized. As shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> crystal pulling rod <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> extends out of the enclosure <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to a conventional drive <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for pulling and rotating the rod <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. A seed crystal <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is mounted at the end of the rod <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and the growing crystal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> forms attached to the seed <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and is drawn upwardly as the rod <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, driven by the drive <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, raises and rotates the crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, an upper heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is positioned around an upper portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and crucible holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A lower heater <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is positioned to surround a lower portion <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and crucible holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The lower heater <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is positioned below the upper heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and a heat insulator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned between the upper heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the lower heater <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The heaters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> may be of conventional design, e.g., electrically powered graphite heaters of cylindrical construction. The insulator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is preferably formed of a durable heat insulating material, such as graphite felt supported by graphite, that can withstand the high temperatures within the growth chamber. It also preferably has a cylindrical form, with an inner surface spaced closely adjacent to the outer surface of the crucible holder <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The insulator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned intermediate the top <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and bottom <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and effectively divides the upper section <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> of the crucible that is heated by the upper heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from the lower section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the crucible that is heated by the lower heater <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The heaters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are provided with electrical power independently of one another so that the amount of heat that they apply to the portions of the crucible adjacent to them can be independently controlled, to thereby allow independent control of the temperature of the crucible and its contents in the upper region <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and in the lower region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The insulator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> helps to maintain the difference in temperature between the upper region <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and the lower region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Temperature sensors <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, e.g., thermocouples, may be mounted in the insulating enclosure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> adjacent to the upper heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and lower heater <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, respectively, to allow the temperatures of the heaters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to be monitored and controlled by controllers <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, respectively. The controllers <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, of conventional design, are connected to supply power to the heaters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to maintain their temperatures at desired levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is relatively long in the axial direction with respect to its diameter as compared with conventional crucibles. A relatively high aspect ratio of length to diameter (e.g., 1.5 to 5) is preferred to allow the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be filled with a solid feed charge <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that is initially significantly greater in volume than the volume of melt material that will be required to allow growth of the crystal. In carrying out the present invention, the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may initially be filled with a mix of the solid feed particles, e.g., particles of InAs mixed with particles of GaAs. This solid feed is then covered by a layer of the encapsulant (e.g., B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). This charge is then melted (e.g., by turning on both of the heaters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to apply high heat), thoroughly mixed, and then cooled to a solid (e.g., by turning off the heaters). The crucible support <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is drawn downwardly to a lowermost position at which the layer of encapsulant and a top portion of the solid feed material are surrounded by the upper heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, while the rest of the solid feed <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is positioned below the insulator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and is surrounded by the heater <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The heaters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are then supplied with power to heat the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and its contents, with the temperature of the upper region <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> being raised by the heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> above the melting point of the solid feed <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and above the melting point of the encapsulant, resulting in a layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of feed melt above the solid feed <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, and a layer of liquid encapsulant <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> over the melt layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The seed crystal <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is then advanced downwardly by the rod <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> into contact with the melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and, after crystallization begins, is slowly drawn upwardly and rotated by the rod <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to draw the crystal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> out of the melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and through the encapsulant <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Zone leveling of dopant in the melt may be utilized, as discussed further below. The drawing of the crystal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> draws material away from the melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. This material is replaced by selective advancing of the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> upwardly by the crucible support <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> so that more of the solid feed <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is advanced into the hotter zone <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which is heated by the upper heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The newly melted material which is added to the melt layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> has the uniform dopant concentration of the solid feed <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, thereby tending to maintain the desired dopant concentration in the melt layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> despite the effects of segregation of dopant that may occur as the crystal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from the melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Typically, the upper heater is reduced a few degrees in temperature to allow seeding and at the same time the lower heater is increased a few degrees to prevent the melt depth from shrinking. After the melt temperature has stabilized, the seed is allowed to grow by further lowering the upper heater temperature by a few degrees and at the same time raising the lower heater temperature by a few degrees. The rate of advancement of the crucible support <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to raise the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> may be controlled in coordination with the drawing of the crystal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> out of the melt in a conventional fashion to maintain a melt layer <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> at a desired volume and dopant concentration. For example, a video camera <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> (e.g., a CCD camera) may be mounted at a viewing port in the enclosure <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to display a picture of the melt surface and the growing crystal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on a monitor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, allowing an operator to adjust the speed of the drives <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The following are examples of crystal growth as carried out in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An apparatus for crystal growth was used as shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> was 30 mm inside diameter (ID) by 33 mm outside diameter (OD) by 85 mm in height. In order to reduce cost, silica crucibles were used rather than pyrolytic BN. The upper graphite heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> applied heat to the melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the lower heater <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> applied heat to the solid feed <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The depth of the melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> was determined by lowering a 1.5 mm diameter probe of quartz or alumina into the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> along the crucible wall. A pyrolytic BN-coated rod could be used as a probe if a pyrolytic BN crucible were used. For a typical experiment the depth of the melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> was from about 30 to 35 mm and its variation during crystal growth was about &plusmn;0.5 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In order to grow a crystal at a targeted InAs concentration C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, the compositions of the growth melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the solid feed <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> were set at C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>/k and C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, respectively, according to the concept of zone leveling, where k is an experimentally determined constant. A k value of 0.116 was experimentally measured for In-doped GaAs in a previous study under similar crystal growth conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The procedure for preparing the solid feed and the melt was as follows: a charge consisting of 6N GaAs, 6N InAs and 5N B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(&lt;200 ppm H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) was loaded in the crucible. The amounts of GaAs and InAs were such that the solid feed of the targeted composition C<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>could be prepared. To grow a crystal of the targeted composition C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.04 mol % InAs, the charge consisted of 230 g GaAs, 0.1224 g InAs and 20 g B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>depth was 16 mm, the melt depth was 32.5 mm and the initial length of the solid feed was 29 mm. The amount of InAs added to the melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for zone leveling was 0.4887 g. This was expected to raise the melt composition to about 0.348 mol % (&equals;0.04 mol %/0.115), based on a selected k value of 0.115. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> To grow a crystal of the targeted composition of C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.1 mol % InAs, the charge consisted of 233.5 g GaAs, 0.3088 g InAs and 20 g B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The amount of InAs added to the melt for zone leveling was 1.2540 g. The melt was 33 mm deep and the solid feed was initially 29 mm long. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Both heaters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> were turned on to melt the charge. After 4 h of mixing at about 1245&deg; C., the melt was allowed to solidify rapidly to minimize macrosegregation in the resultant ingot. Since the melt is separated from the crucible wall by a thin layer of molten B<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, large undercooling of the melt can be achieved easily. This was done suddenly by lowering the crucible <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to below the heaters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and turning-off the heaters immediately. An undercooled melt tends to freeze instantaneously, leaving no time for solute segregation to develop over a long distance that is comparable to the crucible dimension. This rapid solidification is different from directional solidification, which does not reduce macrosegregation. The melt remained in the liquid state with a mirror-like free surface until it solidified instantaneously with a dull top surface, suggesting rapid solidification of an undercooled melt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Immediately after freezing, the crucible was raised back into the heaters and the heaters were turned back on. The power of the lower heater <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, however, was set at a reduced level that was predetermined to give the desired melt depth. After 2 h InAs was added to the melt to level (adjust) the melt composition to C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>/k. The melt was then allowed to mix for 4 h. After seeding, the power of the upper heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> was reduced slightly to allow the seed to grow. The power of the lower heater <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> was raised slightly to help reduce the change in the melt depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Crystals were pulled in the &lsqb;100&rsqb; direction at 4 mm/h and rotated at 20 rpm. The crucible was raised at the speed V<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;V<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>(d<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>/d<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>where V<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>is the crystal pulling speed, d<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>the crystal diameter and d<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>the inner diameter of the crucible. The Ar pressure in the chamber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> was 6.76&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>Pa (98 psi). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The InAs concentration was measured in the resultant crystals in the axial and radial directions by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). Samples about 0.5 g each were removed from the crystals, dissolved in HC1:HNO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>3:1 and then diluted with distilled water to 100 cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the single-crucible LEC process of the present invention, the melt temperature can be adjusted, either for the seed to grow or for adjusting the crystal diameter, which can cause the melt depth to change. The heat applied by upper heater <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the lower heater <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> can be adjusted to help reduce such changes in the melt depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> show the dopant segregation in a rod of GaAs crystal grown with the targeted composition of C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.04 mol % InAs. The InAs concentration is essentially uniform in the axial direction in the crystal of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The InAs concentration in the radial direction, measured in the crystal rod at about 33 mm from the seed end of the crystal, is also uniform, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. This uniform composition of the crystal suggests that the segregation control technique is effective. The axial InAs concentration profile in a similar crystal grown by the conventional LEC process, also included in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, shows the expected dopant segregation that occurs in the conventional LEC process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> show the dopant segregation in a rod of GaAs crystal grown with the targeted composition of C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.1 mol % InAs. Again, the InAs concentration in the crystal rod grown by the present invention is essentially uniform in the axial direction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The InAs concentration in the radial direction, measured at 50 mm from the seed end of the crystal rod is also uniform, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The axial distribution of dopant in a crystal rod grown by the conventional LEC process is also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> for comparison. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The effectiveness of segregation control also depends on the compositional uniformity of the solid feed. The compositional uniformity of the solid feed was not checked in the example above. However, an ingot of Ga<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>In<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>As alloy was prepared using the procedure described above. The ingot was 3 cm in diameter and 3.5 cm high, and the composition was 28.5 &plusmn;1 mol % InAs throughout the ingot. This indicates that solid feed of uniform compositions can be prepared by such procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Fused silica is relatively soft at the crystal growth temperature of GaAs, and if there is a tendency for a silica crucible to crack during the preparation of the solid feed, it cannot be detected if a fused silica crucible is used. An experiment was conducted to find out if the procedure for preparing the solid feed would also work with PBN crucibles. A PBN crucible, obtained from Union Carbide (of the same dimensions as the fused silica crucibles described above), was used, and no signs of cracking were observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present invention may also be utilized to provide crystal growth of alloys to achieve solid crystals in which the alloy concentration is highly uniform both axially and radially. As noted, control over segregation is not feasible in the standard Czochralski process. Segregation control has been feasible in the double-crucible Czochralski process (with a bottom opening in the inner crucible and without an encapsulant) for doped crystals but not crystal alloys. Because the compositions of the growth melt and the replenishing melt are very different in alloy crystal growth (because of the wide gap in the phase diagram), the densities and the freezing temperatures can be significantly different. Consequently, two problems have been encountered in crystal growth with Czochralski processes. First, the two melts can mix suddenly due to the density difference. Second, the outer melt can freeze during crystal growth. The present invention can be utilized to avoid these problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As an example of alloys produced in accordance with the invention, the foregoing processing was carried out utilizing much higher percentages of InAs in the initial feed than are used for In-doping. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> illustrate InAs axial concentration and radial concentration, respectively, for a crystal produced by the foregoing procedure with an InAs concentration of about 5 mol %. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> show InAs axial concentration and radial concentration, respectively, for a crystal produced by the foregoing procedure with an InAs concentration of over 7 mol %. These graphs show that the axial and radial concentrations of the alloy are extremely constant, with a variation from the initial InAs concentration over the length of the crystal rod of less than 5 percent of the initial concentration level. The present invention may also be used to grow alloy crystals of other materials, for example, GaP&mdash;InP and GaP&mdash;GaAs, and may also be used to grow alloys that do not need an encapsulant (e.g., SiGe, NaNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;KNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, etc.). Conventional double crucible systems with a bottom opening in the inner crucible are not as well suited to growing alloy crystals because the growth melt can be heavier than the replenishing melt and thus leak out through the bottom opening of the inner crucible. In the present invention, the heaters <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> maintain the uppermost portion of the melt <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> at a higher temperature than the lowermost portion of the melt, resulting in convection mixing in the melt due to temperature gradients, thereby maintaining the uniformity of the melt. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to hearing aids and other listening conditioning systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a listening conditioning system and a method of establishing and updating filter profiles for the listening conditioning system to accommodate for changes in the hearing of the user of the system and/or for new sound environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hearing aids and other listening conditioning systems are well known in the art. Many of these devices or systems utilize a filter profile established by an audiologist to filter sound in order to compensate for the specific hearing loss, capabilities or preferences of the user. Some of these systems allow the user to select from multiple different filter profiles for different sound environments to which the user may be exposed. The filter profile(s) are determined after the user of the system takes an audiogram test under the supervision of the audiologist or a technician. This is a time consuming process, which may or may not require the user of the listening conditioning system to leave components of the system with the audiologist or the manufacturer for programming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> If the user of the listening conditioning system wishes to establish a new filter profile for a sound environment not previously addressed by the available filter profiles, he or she may again have to return to the audiologist for help in doing so. This is again time consuming and potentially costly. Some prior art systems have allowed the user to adjust some of the operational parameters (volume, etc.) of the filter profiles. Prior art systems which allow the user to adjust the operational parameters of the filter profiles may not do so based upon an audiogram. Further, these systems may not provide the user a mechanism for evaluating and fine tuning these adjustments prior to use in a particular sound environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> People frequently experience changes in hearing capability or preference caused by temporary physical ailments such as colds. These changes in hearing capability can also be more permanent in nature. When the user of a listening conditioning system configured by an audiologist experiences a change in hearing, the corresponding necessary adjustment of the filter profile(s) again typically requires the aid of an audiologist. Once again, this can be a time consuming and expensive process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Many hearing aids and sound conditioning systems suffer from significant signal-to-noise ratio problems due to noisy sound environments and attenuation of the sound waves as they travel from the source of sound to the microphone. Further, when used in environments in which more than one primary source of sound is important, these systems have limitations since regardless of where the microphone is positioned, at least one source of sound will likely not be positioned close enough to the microphone to avoid significant loss of the audible signal. These and other problems with many prior art listening conditioning systems limit their usefulness in some manner. </paragraph>

Although not required, the invention will be described, at least in part, in the general context of computer-executable instructions such as an application program being executed by a personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The user of the listening conditioning system of the present invention can utilize the personal computer to run an application program which develops filter profiles, tailored to the current hearing abilities of the user for multiple sound environments, which can be uploaded to the listening conditioning system. The application program and associated methods, as well as the listening conditioning system, are discussed below in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exemplary system for implementing personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (or other similar computing devices such as hand-held or laptop computers) includes a processing unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a system memory <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and a system bus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that couples various system components including the system memory <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the processing unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The system memory <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> typically includes read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. A basic input/output system (BIOS) <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which helps to transfer information between elements within the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, can be stored in ROM <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> further includes a hard disk drive <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for reading from and writing to a hard disk (not shown), a magnetic disk drive <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for reading from or writing to removable magnetic disk <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and an optical disk drive <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> such as a CD ROM or other optical media. The drives and the associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media, which can store data that is accessible by a computer, can be used in conjunction with computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in implementing the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, magnetic disk <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, optical disk <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or RAM <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, including an operating system <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, one or more application programs <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and program data <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. A user may enter commands and information into the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through input devices such as a keyboard <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, pointing device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and microphone <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through a standard external device or system interface <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Interface <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> can be, for example, a serial port interface. Interface <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> can also be other types of external device or system interfaces such as a sound card, a modem, a network card, a parallel port, a game port or a universal serial bus (USB) for example. A monitor <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> via an interface, such as a video card or adapter <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In addition to the monitor <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, computers may typically include other peripheral output devices such as speakers <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and printers. In embodiments of the invention, computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is coupleable through a serial, USB or other port to audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of a listening conditioning system for the purpose of uploading sound conditioning filter profiles to the audio conditioning unit. This will be described below in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may operate in a networked environment using logic connections to one or more remote computers such as a remote computer <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The remote computer <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> may be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other network node. The logic connections depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> include a local area network (LAN) <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and a wide area network (WAN) <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer network intranets and the Internet, and any of these types of networks can be used to transfer data between computers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> as will be described below in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic illustration of a graphical user interface (GUI) <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of an application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the present invention. GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is displayed on computer monitor <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> in conjunction with the operating system GUI <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. For discussion purposes, inputs, outputs and other features described with reference to GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> should be understood to be discussions of inputs or outputs of application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the present invention. Further, other features of application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which are not specifically illustrated in GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are discussed as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is stored on a computer readable medium containing computer executable instructions for performing various steps in methods of the present invention for creating multiple filter profiles which can be uploaded to an audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of a sound or listening sound conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> runs on computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the user of the listening conditioning system can update or change the filter profiles without the aid of an audiologist as is typically required in the prior art. This is very useful in allowing the user of the listening conditioning system to compensate for temporary changes in hearing, for example caused by colds, allergies or other physical conditions. Also, application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> allows the user of the listening conditioning system to create new filter profiles for different sound environments to which the user may be exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a filter response plot display area <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which is used to display a frequency response curve (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) corresponding to a filter profile generated by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for the user of the listening conditioning system Also provided by GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are filter response manipulation inputs <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which are used to control or change the frequency response of a current filter profile which was loaded into or automatically generated by program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, filter response manipulation inputs <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> include multiple slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and corresponding direct gain numerical readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, each slide scale input <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and each corresponding direct gain numerical readout <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be used to manipulate the gain of a frequency range, of the filter profile, defined by the corner frequencies illustrated in corner frequency numerical inputs <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, only the slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> or only the readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be used to change the gain values, but not both. The corner frequency numerical inputs <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> for each frequency range are illustrated as being those inputs <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which are positioned immediately adjacent either side of the corresponding slide scale input <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and direct gain numerical readout <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Generally, the corner frequencies are set to the default values illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which conform to normal audiogram settings. However, the corner frequencies can be changed by the user if desired by entering different corner frequency values into inputs <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> using a pointing device and keyboard. Check box inputs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are selected to enable the various filter frequency ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also provided by GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are audiogram input controls <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Audiogram <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> input control <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be selected by a user of the personal computer, causing application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to conduct a standard audiogram test of the hearing of the user. Using speakers <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generate a series of tones at differing frequencies with linearly increasing volumes. When the volume of a tone increases to the point that the user can audibly detect the tone, the user provides an input to personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The input can be, for example, a press of a key on keyboard <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> At the end of the audiogram test, application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> automatically sets gain values for the different frequency ranges of the filter profile. This can be seen for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in which slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and direct gain numerical readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> reflect relative gain differences between the frequency ranges of the filter profile. The gain differences between the various frequency ranges in the filter profile are such that when filtering sound, the user of the listening conditioning system will hear sound in each of the frequency ranges at substantially equal volumes (assuming the sound of each frequency range is generated at a substantially equal volume). In other words, the filter profile generated by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> attenuates the gain more in the frequency ranges in which the user&apos;s hearing is best such that when filtered the user will hear the filtered sound substantially equally well in all of the frequency ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Audiogram <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> causes application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to function similarly, but the sequence of tones provided by the personal computer and the speakers is not linearly increased in volume as was the case with the Audiogram <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. A binary search pattern sequency is used. In this manner, Audiogram <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> provides for a faster audiogram test of the user&apos;s hearing. Audiogram <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> can be selected by the user after the application of an the Audiogram <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or Audiogram <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> tests. Selection of the Audiogram <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> causes a series of tones to be filtered by the generated filter profile and played through the speakers. Thus a preliminary check of the filter profile generated using the Audiogram <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or Audiogram <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inputs can be conducted, allowing the user to verify that the volume of each tone sounds approximately equal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Also provided by GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are sound file manipulation inputs <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. When selected, Record Buffer A input control <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> causes application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to record sound data corresponding to audio to be played for the user of the sound conditioning system. The sound data can be representative of a variety of different sound environments to which the user of the listening conditioning system (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) will be exposed. The sound data recorded by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be obtained from a variety of sources. For example, the sound data can be obtained by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> from microphone <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, from data stored on a magnetic or optical disc, from data at the sound card used to drive the speakers, from data downloaded over a computer network such as the Internet, or from other sources. The recorded sound data is temporarily stored in a memory location referred to as &ldquo;Buffer A&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Play Buf A input <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, when selected, causes application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to play the recorded and stored sound data over the speakers of the personal computer. Play Buf B input <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> causes the computer to play sound data stored in a second memory location known as &ldquo;Buffer B&rdquo; over the speakers. Buffer data transfer input control <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> causes sound data stored in the memory location referred to as Buffer A to be transferred to the memory location referred to as Buffer B. Input <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> causes sound data stored in memory location Buffer B to be transferred to the memory location Buffer A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Input <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, when selected, causes the sound data stored in memory location Buffer A to be filtered using the current filter profile (represented by the position of slide scales <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the numerical gain values shown in direct gain inputs <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>), with the filtered results stored in memory location Buffer B. Thus, sound data representing a particular sound environment can be recorded from an external source and stored in Buffer A, filtered using the filter profile generated by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and the filtered sound data stored in the memory location Buffer B. Then, using one or more of inputs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, the filtered sound data can be transferred between memory locations and/or ultimately played over the speakers of the personal computer. Thus, the user of the personal computer and of the listening conditioning system can test the generated filter profile on the recorded sound data to determine whether the filter profile is optimized for the particular sound environment and/or for current hearing loss levels. Maximum decibel input <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> sets the maximum volume of the sound data played back over the speakers of the personal computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Also provided by GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are file manipulation inputs <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. Selecting input <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> causes a sound file having a name, which is input into alphanumeric input box <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, to be loaded into the memory location Buffer A from other more permanent memory locations. Selection of input <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> causes sound file data in memory location Buffer A to be stored in a sound file having a user determined name. Thus, using inputs <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, sound data recorded from other sources can be stored in memory of the personal computer and can be later retrieved for use in analysis of a generated filter profile. Generated profiles can be saved to memory of the computer using input <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> and alphanumeric input <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, while saved profiles can be loaded to application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> using input <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Thereby, multiple filter profiles corresponding to different sound environments and/or hearing conditions of the user can be saved in the memory of personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for uploading to the listening conditioning system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Sinewave control inputs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> respectively allow the duration, volume and frequency of a generated tone to be controlled by the user. The Sinewave or tone established by the user through manipulation of inputs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be transferred to memory location Buffer A using transfer input <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the tone can be filtered using the currently loaded or established filter profile (for example using input <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> discussed above) and played back to the user for analysis of the filter profile. The gain of individual frequency ranges of the filter profile can then be adjusted using tailored tones to facilitate feedback or testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow diagram <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> demonstrating a method in accordance with the present invention. Although described here as method steps, the invention also includes computer readable medium containing computer executable instructions for performing the steps of the method. As shown at block <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the method includes the step of obtaining a first filter profile for an audio conditioning unit of a sound conditioning system, with the first filter profile corresponding to an audiogram of a user of the sound conditioning system. In some embodiments, step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of obtaining the first filter profile for the audio conditioning unit includes retrieving the first filter profile from memory of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this can be accomplished by selecting the load profile input <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the first filter profile can correspond to a filter profile established by an audiologist after conducting an audiogram test of the user&apos;s hearing, or can be a filter profile previously established by the user without the direct aid of an audiologist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring for the moment to the flow diagram <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of obtaining the first filter profile for an audio conditioning unit of a sound conditioning system can include the step shown at block <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> of testing the hearing of the user of the sound conditioning system to establish an audiogram for the user, followed by the step shown at block <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> of determining the first filter profile from the audiogram. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can perform an audiogram-type test of the user&apos;s hearing. As discussed above, the audiogram-type test is initiated by selecting either of inputs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Once the first filter profile for the user is obtained, gain values for the various frequency ranges of the filter profile are automatically set. This can be seen with the repositioning of slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the differing direct gain numerical values in readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Further, by selecting plot frequency response input <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> a frequency response <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is plotted in plot display area <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the method illustrated in flow diagram <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> next includes the step shown at block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of obtaining sound data corresponding to audio to be played for the user of the sound conditioning system. As discussed previously, the sound data corresponding to audio to be played for the user of the sound conditioning system can be obtained from a wide variety of sources. For example, the sound data can be retrieved from memory using input <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The sound data can also be retrieved from internal hardware of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, sound data can be retrieved from the sound card or sound driver of the computer. The sound data can also be retrieved from microphone <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or downloaded from a computer network such as the Internet. Generally, the sound data, and the corresponding audio to be played for the user of the sound conditioning system, represents a sound environment to which the user of the listening conditioning system will be exposed while using the conditioning system. For example, the audio can be various types of music, noise environments, sporting events, or any of a wide variety of other sound audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The method shown in flow diagram <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also includes the step shown at block <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of filtering the sound data using the first filter profile to obtain first filtered sound data. Using application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, this can be performed for example by placing the sound data in Buffer A and selecting input <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> to filter the sound data in Buffer A, placing the filtered sound data in Buffer B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The method next includes the step shown at block <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of playing the first filtered sound data for the user of the sound conditioning system. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this can be implemented by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> upon the user selecting the appropriate input (for example inputs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>) to play the filtered sound data. When the filtered sound data is played by personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the user of the personal computer and the listening conditioning system can make a determination of whether the filtering afforded by the filter profile is appropriate for the particular sound environment and/or the user&apos;s current hearing capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Aspects of the present invention include not only the ability to generate and/or test filter profiles on a variety of different types of audio, but also the ability for the user to adjust the filter profile to accommodate his or her specific needs, without requiring an audiologist&apos;s aid. Using personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the user of the listening conditioning system can adjust filter profiles to compensate for changes in hearing resulting from a cold, for example. Similarly, the user of the listening conditioning system can utilize the personal computer to adjust filter profiles for his or her preferences in a variety of different sound environments. The various adjusted filter profiles can be saved in memory, and multiple different filter profiles can be uploaded to the listening conditioning system where the user selects which filter profile to use in a particular sound environment. These aspects of the present invention are further illustrated in the additional methods steps shown in the flow diagram <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in some embodiments the methods of the present invention further include the step shown at block <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> of receiving a change profile input from an input device controlled by the user of the sound conditioning system. As shown at block <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the application program changes the first filter profile in response to the change profile input. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, this input from the user can be, for example, in the form of clicking on and dragging one of slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to adjust the gain of a particular frequency range of the filter profile. Moving one of slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> results in an automatic change of the gain value in the corresponding readout <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In the alternative, the user of personal computer can in some embodiments change the gain for a particular frequency range simply by clicking on one of readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and using the keyboard to type in a new gain value. When all desired changes to the filter profile are completed, a second filter profile is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A next step in the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> includes filtering the sound data using the second filter profile to obtain second filtered sound data. This step is shown at block <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> and can be implemented, for example, using input <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Next, as shown at block <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, the method includes playing the second filtered sound data for the user of the sound conditioning system. This step can be implemented, for example, using the play buffer inputs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Playing the second filtered sound data for the user of the conditioning system allows the user to determine whether the second filter profile is an improvement over the first filter profile for a particular sound environment and/or for the user&apos;s current hearing capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> illustrate further steps in some embodiments of the methods of the present invention. As illustrated in the flow diagram <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, if the user of the listening conditioning system determines that the second filter profile is an improvement for a particular sound environment or for the current hearing capabilities of the user, he or she provides a save profile input to the application program. For example, using the keyboard or a pointing device, a name for the second filter profile can be entered in file name input <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, and save profile input <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> can be selected to cause the second filter profile to be saved to the memory of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These steps are shown in blocks <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Once one or more (typically multiple) filter profiles are saved in the memory of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the user of the personal computer provides an input command to upload the filter profile(s) to an audio conditioning unit of the user&apos;s listening conditioning system. Upon the application program receiving the upload filter profile input from the input device (block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> shown in flow diagram <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), the second filter profile is uploaded to the audio conditioning unit in response (block <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>) In this manner, the audio conditioning unit of the user&apos;s listening conditioning system can be updated in the convenience of the user&apos;s home. Neither a trip to an audiologist, nor the burden and task of returning the listening conditioning system to the manufacturer, are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating first embodiments of listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the present invention. As shown, listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes multiple effective displacement compression units (EDUs) <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>M, audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and multiple audio delivery components <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>N. Each EDU <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is positionable proximate a sound source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> (sound sources <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>L are shown), and can include an attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> which attaches the EDU to the desired sound source. In some embodiments, the attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is a lapel attachment mechanism which is adapted to attach the EDU to the clothing of a speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring for the moment to the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, shown is a more particular embodiment of an EDU <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> the present invention. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, each EDU <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> includes a microphone or sound sensing component <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> which coverts sound from the proximate source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> into electrical signals <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>. Each EDU <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> also includes a transmitter <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, coupled to the sound sensing component <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, which receives the electrical signals and in response transmits electromagnetic signals <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> (signals <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>M are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) indicative of sound from the proximate source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> sensed by the sound sensing component. By including multiple EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> in system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, multi-channeled wireless raw sound delivery to audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Each channel <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> can correspond to an EDU proximate a different source of sound. However, in some embodiments, multiple EDUs are positioned proximate the same source of sound in order to capture the sound from that source in a stereo format. For example, EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>D are each positioned proximate source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>C. Electromagnetic signals or channels <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>D can thereby provide stereo sound from source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>C. The electromagnetic signals transmitted by EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> can be wireless format signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> also includes audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> in greater detail. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a receiver <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> which receives the electromagnetic signals or channels EDU-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through EDU-M (<highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>N) transmitted by the EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Receiver <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> converts the electromagnetic signals into digital sound data channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> (channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>N are shown). It will be understood by those of skill in the signal processing art that the number of channels M provided to receiver <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> need not be the same as the number of output channels N provided by the receiver. Although several stages of signal processing illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> are shown to include N channels, it is to be understood that the number of channels provided to any stage of the signal processing circuitry need not be the same as the number of channels provided as an output from that stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As is also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> further includes digital signal processing circuitry <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> coupled to the multiple receiver output channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The digital signal processing circuitry <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> filters the digital sound data from each receiver output channel <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> using a filter profile to obtain filtered digital sound data or data channels <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A profile upload input <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> is included in audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and is configured to be coupled to personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or to other sources. Profile upload input <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> receives one or more (typically multiple) available filter profiles from the personal computer or from other sources for use in different sound environments. As such, each of the multiple available filter profiles uploaded to audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> through input <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> corresponds to user preferences or to an audiogram of a user of the listening conditioning system and to a particular sound environment. A profile selection user input <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is also included in audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The user input <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> provides a mechanism for the user of the listening conditioning system to select one of the filter profiles from the multiple available filter profiles. Thus, the user can change the filter profile used to filter sound data based upon the current sound environment to which he or she is exposed. In some embodiments, different filter profiles can be selected to filter different sound data channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> containing sound data from sources in differing sound environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A transmitter <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> of audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is coupled to digital signal processing circuitry <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> and is configured to transmit filtered sound data from each of the plurality of receiver channels. Like EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, transmitter <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> is adapted for wireless transmission of output channels ACUL-ACUN (<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>N). In the particular embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, transmitter <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> transmits filtered sound data from each of the plurality of receiver channels by transmitting filtered digital sound data <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. Sound data <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> can be transmitted in any of a wide range of formats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> also includes at least one audio delivery component (ADC) <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes N ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>N. However, this need not be the case. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, each ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> includes a receiver <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> and a speaker component <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. The receiver receives the filtered sound data <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> from multiple of the ACU output channels <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>N, providing ADC receiver output channel data <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> in response. Speaker component <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> converts the received and filtered sound data <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> into sound for a user <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> (users <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>B are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the present invention, a left audio delivery component and a right audio delivery component are respectively positionable proximate the left and right ears of a user of the listening conditioning system. For example, ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>A and ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>B can be left and right ADCs positionable proximate left and right ears of user <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>A. In these embodiments, audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be configured to transmit a first portion of the filtered sound data, corresponding to a first portion of the plurality of receiver channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> or output channels <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, to the left conditioning unit, while it transmits a second portion of the filtered sound data corresponding to a second portion of the multiple receiver or output channels to the right ADC. Thereby, stereo or directional sound delivery is provided to the user of the listening conditioning system. In some embodiments, the audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is configured such that sound data corresponding to different ones of the multiple receiver channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> (or corresponding output channels <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>) is filtered by the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> using different ones of the plurality of available filter profiles. Therefore, if different sources of sound <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> are positioned in or represent different sound environments, different filter profiles can be used to filter sound data from these different sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can include a universal audio connection with delivery to standard output jacks so that the media used is user optional for different sound environments. A variety of different embodiments of ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can be utilized in the present invention. For example, at least one of ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can include a telephone or cell phone adapted to receive filtered sound data from audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, at least one ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> includes a stereo receiver adapted to receive filtered sound data from audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and to play the sound data over speakers connected to the stereo receiver. In yet other embodiments, at least one ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is a hearing aid device coupleable to the ear of the user. Other embodiments include over ear head phones, in ear head phones, or other sound delivering devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the system disclosed, by the placement of the sound sensing component and electromagnetic propagation (as opposed to wave propagation of the sound), the effective displacement between sound source and sound receiver is compressed. For example when capture is <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&Prime; from the sound source rather than <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime; (8&times;) the sound level is improved by 64 times (36 db). This is audio quality that the conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> need not supply. Furthermore, ambient signal-to-noise is improved by the same factor. Typical sound environments include dining in a restaurant and riding in a car, each of which present significant noise problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to the environments above, in an example use of system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, each of multiple speakers (sound sources <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>) is fitted with a wireless lapel microphone, each with a corresponding receiver channel in the conditioning unit. Directional orientation can be preserved by (color) coding the microphones. The audio conditioning unit delivers the captured sound to the left, balanced, or right ears of the user depending on the relative directions of the speaker(s) as set up by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In addition to the numerous embodiments of the listening conditioning system discussed above, other embodiments within the scope of the invention can also be realized. For example, while in listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, sound capture occurs using an EDU <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, sound capture can also occur in other ways. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, some embodiments of the listening conditioning systems of the invention can acquire the sound without the use of EDUs. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> can include one or more ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> and an audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> similar to those discussed above. However, listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> does not include EDUs to capture sound from sources of sound <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. In listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight>, channels <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> do not necessarily correspond to electromagnetic signals transmitted from a microphone. Instead, channels <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> can correspond to electrical or other types of signals received directly from source of sound <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> or some intermediate circuitry or device. Examples of this type of acquisition of the sound signals would include systems in which the audio conditioning unit was incorporated in and/or coupled directly to circuitry in a telephone, stereo system, television or other personal electronic systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> are representations of the circuitry boundaries which can be defined, in some embodiments, when portions of the listening conditioning systems of the present invention are incorporated in personal or other types of electronic devices. Box <highlight><bold>860</bold></highlight> represents embodiments of the listening conditioning system which would include only audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and one or more ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. In these embodiments, the signals indicative of the source of sound are provided externally from the listening conditioning system. For example, channels <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> provided as inputs to audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can include electrical signals from a stereo receiver, radio, movie theater sound system, personal or laptop computer, television, analog or digital telephones, wireless telephones, and analog or digital cellular phones, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Box <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight> illustrates embodiments in which a listening conditioning system incorporating one or more ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, an audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and one or more sources of sound <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> are all included in an electronic system such as a telephone or those discussed above. In these embodiments, the source of sound can be receivers, transmitters or other electronics which provide a signal indicative of sound content. Generally, the concepts of the present invention in which the audio conditioning unit filters sound signals using filter profiles established by the user can be implemented in a wide range of embodiments. These embodiments can include the ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> and the sources of sound <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> if desired, but this need not be the case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention. In listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, a signal conversion device <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> is coupled to each source of sound for use in sound capture. The signal conversion devices or circuitry can be considered to be part of the audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, or can remain separate. For example, for the sake of illustration, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in which signal conversion circuitry is included with receiver <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight>. In actual implementations, this circuitry can be included with receiver <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight>, can be separate circuitry from receiver <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight>, and can be implemented altogether remotely from the audio conditioning unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Inclusion of signal conversion devices or circuitry in some embodiments of the invention allows use of signals in a wide range of formats. Generally, the signal conversion circuitry or devices receive a first type of signal indicative of sound from a source of desired sound and convert it to a second type of signal indicative of sound from the source of desired sound. Receiver channels provided by audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> provide in response digital sound data for each receiver channel. In various embodiments, any of a wide range of signal types can be received and converted into electrical signals for use by audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. For example, the signals can be electromagnetic signals as discussed previously. However, the signals can also be other signal types such as magnetic signals, infrared signals, optical signals, or other types. The signal conversion devices or circuitry will be of an appropriate type to convert the signals of the first type into electrical signals which can be processed by audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. For example, if the signals are magnetic signals, the signal conversion devices or circuitry shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> could include transformers or other coils which would produce electrical signals in response to varying magnetic fields. If the signals were optical or infrared signals, appropriate optical or infrared receivers or transducers would be as the signal conversion devices in order to convert these signals into electrical signals which could be processed by audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As was the case with the listening conditioning system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> can have its various components implemented within electronic devices such as cellular telephones, digital telephones, personal electronic systems, stereo systems, televisions, wireless telephones, personal computers, radios, to name just a few. These personal electronic devices, when implementing the audio conditioning unit and/or listening conditioning systems described above, are considered to be embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the listening conditioning systems of the present invention include an audio conditioning unit and at least one audio delivery component, though the audio delivery component can also be separate from the listening conditioning system if desired. The audio conditioning unit includes a receiver which provides at least one receiver channel. Each receiver channel receives signals indicative of sound from a source of desired sound and provides as an output digital sound data. As discussed above, these signals received by the receiver can be electrical signals, or can be signals of other formats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Digital signal processing circuitry coupled to the at least one receiver channel filters the digital sound data from each receiver channel using a filter profile to obtain filtered digital sound data In many embodiments, a profile upload input configured to receive multiple filter profiles corresponding to user preferences or to an audiogram of the user of the listening conditioning system is also included. Also, a profile selection user input can be included to allow the user of the listening conditioning system to select the filter profile from multiple filter profiles for a particular sound environment. However, in some applications, only a single filter profile is provided and the profile selection user input is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The audio conditioning unit also includes a transmitter coupled to the digital signal processing circuitry configured to transmit filtered sound data from each receiver channel. The transmitter can represent a radio frequency (RF) or other type of transmitters which transmit signals a distance to an audio delivery component. However, in embodiments in which the listening conditioning system is configured within an electronic device such as a cellular telephone, for example, the transmitter can be driver circuitry or other electronics which derives an audio delivery component to produce sound filtered for the particular user&apos;s preferences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In embodiments in which at least one audio delivery component is included, the audio delivery component(s) include a receiver which receives the filtered sound data from the at least one receiver channel, and a speaker component which converts the received filtered sound data into sound. Once again, the receiver can be a receiver which receives RF or other types of transmitted signals and converts them into electrical signals, or the receiver can simply be circuitry associated with the speaker component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a listening conditioning system of the present invention as implemented in a non-personal electronic application such as at a telephone switching office <highlight><bold>975</bold></highlight>. The methods of the present invention can be utilized, for example by providers of telephone services, to filter telephone audio signals using one or more filter profiles developed for the particular hearing needs of a customer. The provider of telephone service can obtain one or more filter profiles for a particular customer in any of a variety of different manners. For example, the filter profiles can be provided to the telephone service provider by an audiologist, by the customer, or by applying an audiogram-like test similar to those discussed above with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In embodiments in which the provider of telephone service automatically administers this type of test, the test can be administered remotely over the telephone system. For example, using a telephone handset, when the customer hears tones at particular frequencies and volumes, the customer can respond by pressing a key on the telephone handset. Once the filter profile(s) is/are established for a particular customer, incoming audio signals (for example from a first telephone handset <highlight><bold>976</bold></highlight>) can be filtered (at the telephone switching office <highlight><bold>975</bold></highlight>) prior to providing the audio signals to the telephone handset <highlight><bold>977</bold></highlight> of the customer. Thus, in the example of hearing impaired individuals, the telephone audio signal provided to the hearing impaired customer can be already compensated to aid the customer&apos;s listening capabilities. This type of service would be of great value to hearing impaired customers of telephone and digital/analog cellular companies, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> illustrates a method of processing telephone audio signals at a telephone switching office <highlight><bold>975</bold></highlight> (such as a telephone office exchange or a mobile telephone switching office). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> at block <highlight><bold>980</bold></highlight>, the method includes receiving telephone audio signals indicative of sound content from a source of sound intended for a recipient. This can be, for example, receipt of audio signals originating from the telephone of a caller and intended for a recipient (for example with a hearing impairment). Next, as illustrated at block <highlight><bold>981</bold></highlight>, the method includes filtering the telephone audio signals using a filter profile to obtain filtered audio signals. The filter profile corresponds to listening preferences or to an audiogram (or similar hearing profile) of the intended recipient of the audio signals. Then, as illustrated at block <highlight><bold>982</bold></highlight>, the filtered audio signals are provided to the recipient for listening to the sound content. Providing the filtered audio signals to the recipient can occur real-time, or in a time delayed manner. In other words, the filtered telephone audio signals can be stored for later listening by the intended recipient if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns the identification of nucleic acid sequences and constructs, and methods related thereto, and the use of these sequences and constructs to produce genetically modified plants for the purpose of altering the fatty acid composition of plant oils, waxes and related compounds. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DEFINITIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The subject of this invention is a class of enzymes that introduce a hydroxyl group into several different fatty acids resulting in the production of several different kinds of hydroxylated fatty acids. In particular, these enzymes catalyze hydroxylation of oleic acid to 12-hydroxy oleic acid and icosenoic acid to 14-hydroxy icosenoic acid. Other fatty acids such as palmitoleic and erucic acids may also be substrates. Since it is not possible to refer to the enzyme by reference to a unique substrate or product, we refer to the enzyme throughout as kappa hydroxylase to indicate that the enzyme introduces the hydroxyl three carbons distal (i.e., away from the carboxyl carbon of the acyl chain) from a double bond located near the center of the acyl chain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The following fatty acids are also the subject of this invention: ricinoleic acid, 12-hydroxyoctadec-cis-9-enoic acid (12OH-18:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;9</superscript></highlight>); lesquerolic acid, 14-hydroxy-cis-11-icosenoic acid (14OH-20:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;11</superscript></highlight>); densipolic acid, 12-hydroxyoctadec-cis-9,15-dienoic acid (12OH-18:2<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;9,15</superscript></highlight>); auricolic acid, 14-hydroxy-cis-11,17-icosadienoic acid (14OH-20:2<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;11,17</superscript></highlight>); hydroxyerucic, 16-hydroxydocos-cis-13-enoic acid (16OH-22:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;13</superscript></highlight>); hydroxypalmitoleic, 12-hydroxyhexadec-cis-9-enoic (12OH-16:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;9</superscript></highlight>); icosenoic acid (20:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;11</superscript></highlight>). It will be noted that icosenoic acid is spelled eicosenoic acid in some countries. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Extensive surveys of the fatty acid composition of seed oils from different species of higher plants have resulted in the identification of at least 33 structurally distinct monchydroxylated plant fatty acids, and 12 different polyhydroxylated fatty acids that are accumulated by one or more plant species (reviewed by van de Loo et al. 1993). Ricinoleic acid, the principal constituent of the seed oil from the castor plant <highlight><italic>Ricinus communis </italic></highlight>(L.), is of commercial importance. We have previously described the cloning of a gene from this species that encodes a fatty acid hydroxylase, and the use of this gene to produce ricinoleic acid in transgenic plants of other species (see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/320,982, filed Oct. 11, 1994). The scientific evidence supporting the claims in that patent application were subsequently published (van de Loo et al., 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The use of the castor hydroxylase gene to also produce other hydroxylated fatty acids such as lesquerolic acid, densipolic acid, hydroxypalmitoleic, hydroxyerucic and auricolic acid in transgenic plants is the subject of this invention. In addition, the identification of a gene encoding a homologous hydroxylase from <highlight><italic>Lesquerella fendleri</italic></highlight>, and the use of this gene to produce these hydroxylated fatty acids in transgenic plants is the subject of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Castor is a minor oilseed crop. Approximately 50% of the seed weight is oil (triacylglycerol) in which 85-90% of total fatty acids are the hydroxylated fatty acid, ricinoleic acid. Oil pressed or extracted from castor seeds has many industrial uses based upon the properties endowed by the hydroxylated fatty acid. The most important uses are production of paints and varnishes, nylon-type synthetic polymers, resins, lubricants, and cosmetics (Atsmon 1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition to oil, the castor seed contains the extremely toxic protein ricin, allergenic proteins, and the alkaloid ricinine. These constituents preclude the use of the untreated seed meal (following oil extraction) as a livestock feed, normally an important economic aspect of oilseed utilization. Furthermore, with the variable nature of castor plants and a lack of investment in breeding, castor has few favorable agronomic characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For a combination of these reasons, castor is no longer grown in the United States and the development of an alternative domestic source of hydroxylated fatty acids would be attractive. The production of ricinoleic acid, the important constituent of castor oil, in an established oilseed crop through genetic engineering would be a particularly effective means of creating a domestic source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Because there is no practical source of lesquerolic, densipolic and auricolic acids from plants that are adapted to modern agricultural practices, there is currently no large-scale use of these fatty acids by industry. However, the fatty acids would have uses similar to those of ricinoleic acid if they could be produced in large quantities at comparable cost to other plant-derived fatty acids (Smith 1985). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Plant species, such as certain species in the genus Lesquerella, that accumulate a high proportion of these fatty acids, have not been domesticated and are not currently considered a practical source of fatty acids (Hirsinger, 1989). This invention represents a useful step toward the eventual production of these and other hydroxylated fatty acids in transgenic plants of agricultural importance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The taxonomic relationships between plants having similar or identical kinds of unusual fatty acids have been examined (van de Loo et al., 1993). In some cases, particular fatty acids occur mostly or solely in related taxa. In other cases there does not appear to be a direct link between taxonomic relationships and the occurrence of unusual fatty acids. In this respect, ricinoleic acid has now been identified in 12 genera from 10 families (reviewed in van de Loo et al., 1993). Thus, it appears that the ability to synthesize hydroxylated fatty acids has evolved several times independently during the radiation of the angiosperms. This suggested to us that the enzymes which introduce hydroxyl groups into fatty acids arose by minor modifications of a related enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Indeed, as shown herein, the sequence similarity between &Dgr;12 fatty acid desaturases and the kappa hydroxylase from castor is so high that it is not possible to unambiguously determine whether a particular enzyme is a desaturase or a hydroxylase on the basis of evidence in the scientific literature. Similarly, a patent application (PCT/US93/09987) that purports to teach the isolation and use of &Dgr;12 fatty acid desaturases does not teach how to distinguish a hydroxylase from a desaturase. In view of the importance of being able to distinguish between these activities for the purpose of genetic engineering of plant oils, the utility of that application is limited to the several instances where direct experimental evidence (e.g., altered fatty acid composition in transgenic plants) was presented to support the assignment of function. A method for distinguishing between fatty acid desaturases and fatty acid hydroxylases on the basis of amino acid sequence of the enzyme is also a subject of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A feature of hydroxylated or other unusual fatty acids is that they are generally confined to seed triacylglycerols, being largely excluded from the polar lipids by unknown mechanisms (Battey and Ohlrogge 1989; Prasad et al., 1987). This is particularly intriguing since diacylglycerol is a precursor of both triacylglycerol and polar lipid. With castor microsomes, there is some evidence that the pool of ricinoleoyl-containing polar lipid is minimized by a preference of diacylglycerol acyltransferase for ricinoleate-containing diacylglycerols (Bafor et al. 1991). Analyses of vegetative tissues have generated few reports of unusual fatty acids, other than those occurring in the cuticle. The cuticle contains various hydroxylated fatty acids which are interesterified to produce a high molecular weight polyester which serves a structural role. A small number of other exceptions exist in which unusual fatty acids are found in tissues other than the seed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The biosynthesis of ricinoleic acid from oleic acid in the developing endosperm of castor (<highlight><italic>Ricinus communis</italic></highlight>) has been studied by a variety of methods. Morris (1967) established in double-labeling studies that hydroxylation occurs directly by hydroxyl substitution rather than via an unsaturated-, keto- or epoxy-intermediate. Hydroxylation using oleoyl-CoA as precursor can be demonstrated in crude preparations or microsomes, but activity in microsomes is unstable and variable, and isolation of the microsomes involved a considerable, or sometimes complete loss of activity (Galliard and Stumpf, 1966; Moreau and Stumpf, 1981). Oleic acid can replace oleoyl-CoA as a precursor, but only in the presence of CoA, MG<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> and ATP (Galliard and Stumpf, 1966) indicating that activation to the acyl-CoA is necessary. However, no radioactivity could be detected in ricinoleoyl-CoA (Moreau and Stumpf, 1981). These and more recent observations (Bafor et al., 1991) have been interpreted as evidence that the substrate for the castor oleate hydroxylase is oleic acid esterified to phosphatidylcholine or another phospholipid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The hydroxylase is sensitive to cyanide and azide, and dialysis against metal chelators reduces activity, which could be restored by addition of FeSO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, suggesting iron involvement in enzyme activity (Galliard and Stumpf, 1966). Ricinoleic acid synthesis requires molecular oxygen (Galliard and Stumpf, 1966; Moreau and Stumpf 1981) and requires NAD(P)H to reduce cytochrome b5 which is thought to be the intermediate electron donor for the hydroxylase reaction (Smith et al., 1992). Carbon monoxide does not inhibit hydroxylation, indicating that a cytochrome P450 is not involved (Galliard and Stumpf, 1966; Moreau and Stumpf 1981). Data from a study of the substrate specificity of the hydroxylase show that all substrate parameters (i.e., chain length and double bond position with respect to both ends) are important; deviations in these parameters caused reduced activity relative to oleic acid (Howling et al., 1972). The position at which the hydroxyl was introduced, however, was determined by the position of the double bond, always being three carbons distal. Thus, the castor acyl hydroxylase enzyme can produce a family of different hydroxylated fatty acids depending on the availability of substrates. Thus, as a matter of convenience, we refer to the enzyme throughout as a kappa hydroxylase (rather than an oleate hydroxylase) to indicate the broad substrate specificity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The castor kappa hydroxylase has many superficial similarities to the microsomal fatty acyl desaturases (Browse and Somerville, 1991). In particular, plants have a microsomal oleate desaturase active at the &Dgr;12 position. The substrate of this enzyme (Schmidt et al., 1993) and of the hydroxylase (Bafor et al., 1991) appears to be a fatty acid esterified to the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine. When oleate is the substrate, the modification occurs at the same position (&Dgr;12) in the carbon chain, and requires the same cofactors, namely electrons from NADH via cytochrome b<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>and molecular oxygen. Neither enzyme is inhibited by carbon monoxide (Moreau and Stumpf, 1981), the characteristic inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> There do not appear to have been any published biochemical studies of the properties of the hydroxylase enzyme(s) in Lesquerella. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Conceptual Basis of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/320,982, we described the use of a cDNA clone from castor for the production of ricinoleic acid in transgenic plants. As noted above, biochemical studies by others had suggested that the castor hydroxylase may not have strict specificity for oleic acid but would also catalyze hydroxylation of other fatty acids such as icosenoic acid (20:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;11</superscript></highlight>) (Howling et al., 1972). Based on these studies, our previous application Ser. No. 08/320,982 noted in Example 2 that the expression of the castor hydroxylase in transgenic plants of species such as <highlight><italic>Brassica napus </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>that accumulate fatty acids such as icosenoic acid (20:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;11</superscript></highlight>) and erucic acid (13-docosenoic acid; 22:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;13</superscript></highlight>) would be expected to accumulate some of the hydroxylated derivatives of these fatty acids due to the activity of the hydroxylase on these fatty acids. We have now obtained additional direct evidence for such a claim based on the production of ricinoleic, lesquerolic, densipolic and auricolic fatty acids in transgenic Arabidopsis plants and have included such evidence herein as Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In Example 3 of the previous application, we taught the various methods by which the castor hydroxylase clone and sequences derived thereof could be used to identify other hydroxylase clones from plant species such as <highlight><italic>Lesquerella fendleri </italic></highlight>that are known to accumulate hydroxylated fatty acids in seed oils. In this continuation we have provided an example of the use of that aspect of the invention for the isolation of a novel hydroxylase gene from <highlight><italic>Lesquerella fendleri</italic></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In view of the high degree of sequence similarity between &Dgr;12 fatty acid desaturases and the castor hydroxylase (van de Loo et al., 1995), the validity of claims (e.g., PCT WO 94/11516) for the use of desaturase or hydroxylase genes or sequences derived therefrom for the identification of genes of identical function from other species must be viewed with skepticism. In this application, we teach a method by which hydroxylase genes can be distinguished from desaturases and describe methods by which &Dgr;12 desaturases can be converted to hydroxylases by the modification of the gene encoding the desaturases. A mechanistic basis for the similar reaction mechanisms of desaturases and hydroxylases was presented in the earlier patent application (Ser. No. 08/320,982). Briefly, the available evidence suggests that fatty acid desaturases have a similar reaction mechanism to the bacterial enzyme methane monooxygenase which catalyses a reaction involving oxygen-atom transfer (CH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&rarr;CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OH) (van de Loo et al., 1993). The cofactor in the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase is termed a &mgr;-oxo bridged diiron cluster (FeOFe). The two iron atoms of the FeOFe cluster are liganded by protein-derived nitrogen or oxygen atoms, and are tightly redox-coupled by the covalently-bridging oxygen atom. The FeOFe cluster accepts two electrons, reducing it to the diferrous state, before oxygen binding. Upon oxygen binding, it is likely that heterolytic cleavage also occurs, leading to a high valent oxoiron reactive species that is stabilized by resonance rearrangements possible within the tightly coupled FeOFe cluster. The stabilized high-valent oxoiron state of methane monooxygenase is capable of proton extraction from methane, followed by oxygen transfer, giving methanol. The FeOFe cofactor has been shown to be directly relevant to plant fatty acid modifications by the demonstration that castor stearoyl-ACP desaturase contains this type of cofactor (Fox et al., 1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the foregoing considerations, we hypothesized that the castor oleate hydroxylase is a structurally modified fatty acyl desaturase, based upon three arguments. The first argument involves the taxonomic distribution of plants containing ricinoleic acid. Ricinoleic acid has been found in 12 genera of 10 families of higher plants (reviewed in van de Loo et al., 1993). Thus, plants in which ricinoleic acid occurs are found throughout the plant kingdom, yet close relatives of these plants do not contain the unusual fatty acid. This pattern suggests that the ability to synthesize ricinoleic acid has arisen (and been lost) several times independently, and is therefore a quite recent divergence. In other words, the ability to synthesize ricinoleic acid has evolved rapidly, suggesting that a relatively minor genetic change in the structure of the ancestral enzyme was necessary to accomplish it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The second argument is that many biochemical properties of castor kappa hydroxylase are similar to those of the microsomal desaturases, as discussed above (e.g., both preferentially act on fatty acids esterified to the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine, both use cytochrome b5 as an intermediate electron donor, both are inhibited by cyanide, both require molecular oxygen as a substrate, both are thought to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The third argument stems from the discussion of oxygenase cofactors above, in which it is suggested that the plant membrane bound fatty acid desaturases may have a &mgr;-oxo bridged diiron cluster-type cofactor, and that such cofactors are capable of catalyzing both fatty acid desaturations and hydroxylations, depending upon the electronic and structural properties of the protein active site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Taking these three arguments together, it was hypothesized that kappa hydroxylase of castor endosperm is homologous to the microsomal oleate &Dgr;12 desaturase found in all plants. The evidence supporting this hypothesis was disclosed in the previous patent application (Ser. No. 08/320,982). A number of genes encoding microsomal &Dgr;12 desaturases from various species have recently been cloned (Okuley et al., 1994) and substantial information about the structure of these enzymes is now known (Shanklin et al. 1994). Hence, in the following invention we teach how to use structural information about fatty acyl desaturases to isolate kappa hydroxylase genes of this invention. This example teaches the method by which any carbon-monoxide insensitive plant fatty acyl hydroxylase gene can be identified by one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An unpredicted outcome of our studies on the castor hydroxylase gene in transgenic Arabidopsis plants was the discovery that expression of the hydroxylase leads to increased accumulation of oleic acid in seed lipids. Because of the low nucleotide sequence homology between the castor hydroxylase and the &Dgr;12-desaturase (about 67%), we consider it unlikely that this effect is due to silencing (also called sense-suppression or cosuppression) of the expression of the desaturase gene by the hydroxylase gene. Whatever the basis for the effect, this invention teaches the use of hydroxylase genes to alter the level of fatty acid unsaturation in transgenic plants. On the basis of a hypothesis about the mechanisms of the effect, this invention also teaches the use of genetically modified hydroxylase and desaturase genes to achieve directed modification of fatty acid unsaturation levels.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to plant fatty acyl hydroxylases. Methods to use conserved amino acid or nucleotide sequences to obtain plant fatty acyl hydroxylases are described. Also described is the use of cDNA clones encoding a plant hydroxylase to produce a family of hydroxylated fatty acids in transgenic plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment, this invention is directed to recombinant DNA constructs which can provide for the transcription or transcription and translation (expression) of the plant kappa hydroxylase sequence. In particular, constructs which are capable of transcription or transcription and translation in plant host cells are preferred. Such constructs may contain a variety of regulatory regions including transcriptional initiation regions obtained from genes preferentially expressed in plant seed tissue. In a second aspect, this invention relates to the presence of such constructs in host cells, especially plant host cells which have an expressed plant kappa hydroxylase therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, this invention relates to a method for producing a plant kappa hydroxylase in a host cell or progeny thereof via the expression of a construct in the cell. Cells containing a plant kappa hydroxylase as a result of the production of the plant kappa hydroxylase encoding sequence are also contemplated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, this invention relates to methods of using a DNA sequence encoding a plant kappa hydroxylase for the modification of the proportion of hydroxylated fatty acids produced within a cell, especially plant cells. Plant cells having such a modified hydroxylated fatty acid composition are also contemplated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of this invention, plant kappa hydroxylase proteins and sequences which are related thereto, including amino acid and nucleic acid sequences, are contemplated. Plant kappa hydroxylase exemplified herein includes a <highlight><italic>Lesquerella fendleri </italic></highlight>fatty acid hydroxylase. This exemplified fatty acid hydroxylase may be used to obtain other plant fatty acid hydroxylases of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of this invention, a nucleic acid sequence which directs the seed specific expression of an associated polypeptide coding sequence is described. The use of this nucleic acid sequence or fragments derived thereof, to obtain seed-specific expression in higher plants of any coding sequence is contemplated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of this invention, the use of genes encoding fatty acyl hydroxylases of this invention are used to alter the amount of fatty acid unsaturation of seed lipids. We further envision the use of genetically modified hydroxylase and desaturase genes to achieve directed modification of fatty acid unsaturation levels. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A genetically transformed plant of the present invention which accumulates hydroxylated fatty acids can be obtained by expressing the double-stranded DNA molecules described in this application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A plant fatty acid hydroxylase of this invention includes any sequence of amino acids, such as a protein, polypeptide or peptide fragment, or nucleic acid sequences encoding such polypeptides, obtainable from a plant source which demonstrates the ability to catalyze the production of ricinoleic, lesquerolic, hydroxyerucic (16-hydroxydocos-cis-13-enoic acid) or hydroxypalmitoleic (12-hydroxyhexadec-cis-9-enoic) from CoA, ACP or lipid-linked monoenoic fatty acid substrates under plant enzyme reactive conditions. By &ldquo;enzyme reactive conditions&rdquo; is meant that any necessary conditions are available in an environment (i.e., such factors as temperature, pH, lack of inhibiting substances) which will permit the enzyme to function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Preferential activity of a plant fatty acid hydroxylase toward a particular fatty acyl substrate is determined upon comparison of hydroxylated fatty acid product amounts obtained per different fatty acyl substrates. For example, by &ldquo;oleate preferring&rdquo; is meant that the hydroxylase activity of the enzyme preparation demonstrates a preference for oleate-containing substrates over other substrates. Although the precise substrate of the castor fatty acid hydroxylase is not known, it is thought to be a monounsaturated fatty acid moiety which is esterified to a phospholipid such as phosphatidylcholine. However, it is also possible that monounsaturated fatty acids esterified to phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid or a neutral lipid such as diacylglycerol or a Coenzyme-A thicester may also be substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As noted above, significant activity has been observed in radioactive labelling studies using fatty acyl substrates other than oleate (Howling et al., 1972) indicating that the substrate specificity is for a family of related fatty acyl compounds. Because the castor hydroxylase introduces hydroxy groups three carbons from a double bond, proximal to the methyl carbon of the fatty acid, we term the enzyme a kappa hydroxylase for convenience. Of particular interest, we envision that the castor kappa hydroxylase may be used for production of 12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid (ricinoleate), 12-hydroxy-9-hexadecenoic acid, 14-hydroxy-11-eicosenoic acid, 16-hydroxy-13-docosanoic acid, 9-hydroxy-6-octadecenoic acid by expression in plants species which produce the non-hydroxylated precursors. We also envision production of additionally modified fatty acids such as 12-hydroxy-9,15-octadecadienoic acid that result from desaturation of hydroxylated fatty acids (e.g., 12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid in this example). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> We also envision that future advances in the genetic engineering of plants will lead to production of substrate fatty acids, such as icosenoic acid esters, and palmitoleic acid esters in plants that do not normally accumulate such fatty acids. We envision that the invention described herein may be used in conjunction with such future improvements to produce hydroxylated fatty acids of this invention in any plant species that is amenable to directed genetic modification. Thus, the applicability of this invention is not limited in our conception only to those species that currently accumulate suitable substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As noted above, a plant kappa hydroxylase of this invention will display activity towards various fatty acyl substrates. During biosynthesis of lipids in a plant cell, fatty acids are typically covalently bound to acyl carrier protein (ACP), coenzyme A (CoA) or various cellular lipids. Plant kappa hydroxylases which display preferential activity toward lipid-linked acyl substrate are especially preferred because they are likely to be closely associated with normal pathway of storage lipid synthesis in immature embryos. However, activity toward acyl CoA substrates or other synthetic substrates, for example, is also contemplated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Other plant kappa hydroxylases are obtainable from the specific exemplified sequences provided herein. Furthermore, it will be apparent that one can obtain natural and synthetic plant kappa hydroxylases including modified amino acid sequences and starting materials for synthetic-protein modeling from the exemplified plant kappa hydroxylase and from plant kappa hydroxylases which are obtained through the use of such exemplified sequences. Modified amino acid sequences include sequences which have been mutated, truncated, increased and the like, whether such sequences were partially or wholly synthesized. Sequences which are actually purified from plant preparations or are identical or encode identical proteins thereto, regardless of the method used to obtain the protein or sequence, are equally considered naturally derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Thus, one skilled in the art will readily recognize that antibody preparations, nucleic acid probes (DNA and RNA) and the like may be prepared and used to screen and recover &ldquo;homologous&rdquo; or &ldquo;related&rdquo; kappa hydroxylases from a variety of plant sources. Typically, nucleic acid probes are labeled to allow detection, preferably with radioactivity although enzymes or other methods may also be used. For immunological screening methods, antibody preparations either monoclonal or polyclonal are utilized. Polyclonal antibodies, although less specific, typically are more useful in gene isolation. For detection, the antibody is labeled using radioactivity or any one of a variety of second antibody/enzyme conjugate systems that are commercially available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Homologous sequences are found when there is an identity of sequence and may be determined upon comparison of sequence information, nucleic acid or amino acid, or through hybridization reactions between a known kappa hydroxylase and a candidate source. Conservative changes, such as Glu/Asp, Val/Ile, Ser/Thr, Arg/Lys and Gln/Asn may also be considered in determining sequence homology. Typically, a lengthy nucleic acid sequence may show as little as 50-60% sequence identity, and more preferably at least about 70% sequence identity, between the target sequence and the given plant kappa hydroxylase of interest excluding any deletions which may be present, and still be considered related. Amino acid sequences are considered homologous by as little as 25% sequence identity between the two complete mature proteins. (See generally, Doolittle, R. F., OF URFS and ORFS, University Science Books, CA, 1986.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A genomic or other appropriate library prepared from the candidate plant source of interest may be probed with conserved sequences from the plant kappa hydroxylase to identify homologously related sequences. Use of an entire cDNA or other sequence may be employed if shorter probe sequences are not identified. Positive clones are then analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and/or sequencing. When a genomic library is used, one or more sequences may be identified providing both the coding region, as well as the transcriptional regulatory elements of the kappa hydroxylase gene from such plant source. Probes can also be considerably shorter than the entire sequence. oligonucleotides may be used, for example, but should be at least about 10, preferably at least about 15, more preferably at least 20 nucleotides in length. When shorter length regions are used for comparison, a higher degree of sequence identity is required than for longer sequences. Shorter probes are often particularly useful for polymerase chain reactions (PCR) , especially when highly conserved sequences can be identified (See Gould, et al., 1989 for examples of the use of PCR to isolate homologous genes from taxonomically diverse species). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> When longer nucleic acid fragments are employed (&gt;100 bp) as probes, especially when using complete or large cDNA sequences, one would screen with low stringencies (for example, 40-50&deg; C. below the melting temperature of the probe) in order to obtain signal from the target sample with 20-50% deviation, i.e., homologous sequences. (Beltz, et al. 1983). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a plant kappa hydroxylase of this invention will have at least 60% overall amino acid sequence similarity with the exemplified plant kappa hydroxylase. In particular, kappa hydroxylases which are obtainable from an amino acid or nucleic acid sequence of a castor or lesquerella kappa hydroxylase are especially preferred. The plant kappa hydroxylases may have preferential activity toward longer or shorter chain fatty acyl substrates. Plant fatty acyl hydroxylases having oleate-12-hydroxylase activity and eicosenoate-14-hydroxylase activity are both considered homologously related proteins because of in vitro evidence (Howling et al., 1972), and evidence disclosed herein, that the castor kappa hydroxylase will act on both substrates. Hydroxylated fatty acids may be subject to further enzymatic modification by other enzymes which are normally present or are introduced by genetic engineering methods. For example, 14-hydroxy-11,17-eicosadienoic acid, which is present in some Lesquerella species (Smith 1985), is thought to be produced by desaturation of 14-hydroxy-11-eicosenoic acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Again, not only can gene clones and materials derived thereof be used to identify homologous plant fatty acyl hydroxylases, but the resulting sequences obtained therefrom may also provide a further method to obtain plant fatty acyl hydroxylases from other plant sources. In particular, PCR may be a useful technique to obtain related plant fatty acyl hydroxylases from sequence data provided herein. One skilled in the art will be able to design oligonucleotide probes based upon sequence comparisons or regions of typically highly conserved sequence. Of special interest are polymerase chain reaction primers based on the conserved regions of amino acid sequence between the castor kappa hydroxylase and the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>hydroxylase (SEQ ID NO:4). Details relating to the design and methods for a PCR reaction using these probes are described more fully in the examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that the fatty acyl hydroxylases of a variety of sources can be used to investigate fatty acid hydroxylation events in a wide variety of plant and in vivo applications. Because all plants synthesize fatty acids via a common metabolic pathway, the study and/or application of one plant fatty acid hydroxylase to a heterologous plant host may be readily achieved in a variety of species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Once the nucleic acid sequence is obtained, the transcription, or transcription and translation (expression), of the plant fatty acyl hydroxylases in a host cell is desired to produce a ready source of the enzyme and/or modify the composition of fatty acids found therein in the form of free fatty acids, esters (particularly esterified to glyceroliplds or as components of wax esters), estolides, or ethers. Other useful applications may be found when the host cell is a plant host cell, in vitro and in vivo. For example, by increasing the amount of an kappa hydroxylase available to the plant, an increased percentage of ricinoleate or lesqueroleate (14-hydroxy-11-eicosenoic acid) may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Kapoa Hydroxylase </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> By this invention, a mechanism for the biosynthesis of ricinoleic acid in plants is demonstrated. Namely, that a specific plant kappa hydroxylase having preferential activity toward fatty acyl substrates is involved in the accumulation of hydroxylated fatty acids in at least some plant species. The use of the terms ricinoleate or ricinoleic acid (or lesqueroleate or lesquerolic acid, densipoleate etc.) is intended to include the free acids, the ACP and CoA esters, the salts of these acids, the glycerolipid esters (particularly the triacylglycerol esters), the wax esters, the estolides and the ether derivatives of these acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The determination that plant fatty acyl hydroxylases are active in the in vivo production of hydroxylated fatty acids suggests several possibilities for plant enzyme sources. In fact, hydroxylated fatty acids are found in some natural plant species in abundance. For example, three hydroxy fatty acids related to ricinoleate occur in major amounts in seed oils from various Lesquerella species. Of particular interest, lesquerolic acid is a 20 carbon homolog of ricinoleate with two additional carbons at the carboxyl end of the chain (Smith 1985). Other natural plant sources of hydroxylated fatty acids include but are not limited to seeds of the Linum genus, seeds of Wrightia species, Lycopodium species, Strophanthus species, Convolvulaces species, Calendula species and many others (van de Loo et al., 1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Plants having significant presence of ricinoleate or lesqueroleate or desaturated other or modified derivatives of these fatty acids are preferred candidates to obtain naturally-derived kappa hydroxylases. For example, <highlight><italic>Lesquerella densipila </italic></highlight>contains a diunsaturated 18 carbon fatty acid with a hydroxyl group (van de Loo et al., 1993) that is thought to be produced by an enzyme that is closely related to the castor kappa hydroxylase, according to the theory on which this invention is based. In addition, a comparison between kappa hydroxylases and between plant fatty acyl hydroxylases which introduce hydroxyl groups at positions other than the 12-carbon of oleate or the 14-carbon of lesqueroleate or on substrates other than oleic acid and icosenoic acid may yield insights for protein modeling or other modifications to create synthetic hydroxylases as discussed above. For example, on the basis of information gained from structural comparisons of the &Dgr;12 desaturases and the kappa hydroxylase, we envision making genetic modifications in the structural genes for &Dgr;12 desaturases that convert these desaturases to kappa-hydroxylases. We also envision making changes in &Dgr;15 hydroxylases that convert these to hydroxylases with comparable substrate specificity to the desaturases (e.g., conversion of 18:2<highlight><superscript>&Dgr;9,12 </superscript></highlight>to 15OH-18:2<highlight><superscript>&Dgr;9,12</superscript></highlight>. Since the difference between a hydroxylase and a desaturases concerns the disposition of one proton, we envision that by systematically changing the charged groups in the region of the enzyme near the active site, we can effect this change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Especially of interest are fatty acyl hydroxylases which demonstrate activity toward fatty acyl substrates other than oleate, or which introduce the hydroxyl group at a location other than the C12 carbon. As described above, other plant sources may also provide sources for these enzymes through the use of protein purification, nucleic acid probes, antibody preparations, protein modeling, or sequence comparisons, for example, and of special interest are the respective amino acid and nucleic acid sequences corresponding to such plant fatty acyl hydroxylases. Also as previously described, once a nucleic acid sequence is obtained for the given plant hydroxylase, further plant sequences may be compared and/or probed to obtain homologously related DNA sequences thereto and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Genetic Engineering Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As is well known in the art, once a cDNA clone encoding a plant kappa hydroxylase is obtained, it may be used to obtain its corresponding genomic nucleic acid sequences thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid sequences which encode plant kappa hydroxylases may be used in various constructs, for example, as probes to obtain further sequences from the same or other species. Alternatively, these sequences may be used in conjunction with appropriate regulatory sequences to increase levels of the respective hydroxylase of interest in a host cell for the production of hydroxylated fatty acids or study of the enzyme in vitro or in vivo or to decrease or increase levels of the respective hydroxylase of interest for some applications when the host cell is a plant entity, including plant cells, plant parts (including but not limited to seeds, cuttings or tissues) and plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A nucleic acid sequence encoding a plant kappa hydroxylase of this invention may include genomic, cDNA or mRNA sequence. By &ldquo;encoding&rdquo; is meant that the sequence corresponds to a particular amino acid sequence either in a sense or anti-sense orientation. By &ldquo;recombinant&rdquo; is meant that the sequence contains a genetically engineered modification through manipulation via mutagenesis, restriction enzymes, and the like. A cDNA sequence may or may not encode pre-processing sequences, such as transit or signal peptide sequences. Transit or signal peptide sequences facilitate the delivery of the protein to a given organelle and are frequently cleaved from the polypeptide upon entry into the organelle, releasing the &ldquo;mature&rdquo; sequence. The use of the precursor DNA sequence is preferred in plant cell expression cassettes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, as discussed above the complete genomic sequence of the plant kappa hydroxylase may be obtained by the screening of a genomic library with a probe, such as a cDNA probe, and isolating those sequences which regulate expression in seed tissue. In this manner, the transcription and translation initiation regions, introns, and/or transcript termination regions of the plant kappa hydroxylase may be obtained for use in a variety of DNA constructs, with or without the kappa hydroxylase structural gene. Thus, nucleic acid sequences corresponding to the plant kappa hydroxylase of this invention may also provide signal sequences useful to direct transport into an organelle 5&prime; upstream non-coding regulatory regions (promoters) having useful tissue and timing profiles, 3&prime; downstream non-coding regulatory region useful as transcriptional and translational regulatory regions and may lend insight into other features of the gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Once the desired plant kappa hydroxylase nucleic acid sequence is obtained, it may be manipulated in a variety of ways. Where the sequence involves non-coding flanking regions, the flanking regions may be subjected to resection, mutagenesis, etc. Thus, transitions, transversions, deletions, and insertions may be performed on the naturally occurring sequence. In addition, all or part of the sequence may be synthesized. In the structural gene, one or more codons may be modified to provide for a modified amino acid sequence, or one or more codon mutations may be introduced to provide for a convenient restriction site or other purpose involved with construction or expression. The structural gene may be further modified by employing synthetic adapters, linkers to introduce one or more convenient restriction sites, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid or amino acid sequences encoding a plant kappa hydroxylase of this invention may be combined with other non-native, or &ldquo;heterologous&rdquo;, sequences in a variety of ways. By &ldquo;heterologous&rdquo; sequences is meant any sequence which is not naturally found joined to the plant kappa hydroxylase, including, for example, combination of nucleic acid sequences from the same plant which are not naturally found joined together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The DNA sequence encoding a plant kappa hydroxylase of this invention may be employed in conjunction with all or part of the gene sequences normally associated with the kappa hydroxylase. In its component parts, a DNA sequence encoding kappa hydroxylase is combined in a DNA construct having, in the 5&prime; to 3&prime; direction of transcription, a transcription initiation control region capable of promoting transcription and translation in a host cell, the DNA sequence encoding plant kappa hydroxylase and a transcription and translation termination region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Potential host cells include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. A host cell may be unicellular or found in a multicellular differentiated or undifferentiated organism depending upon the intended use. Cells of this invention may be distinguished by having a plant kappa hydroxylase foreign to the wild-type cell present therein, for example, by having a recombinant nucleic acid construct encoding a plant kappa hydroxylase therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Depending upon the host, the regulatory regions will vary, including regions from viral, plasmid or chromosomal genes, or the like. For expression in prokaryotic or eukaryotic microorganisms, particularly unicellular hosts, a wide variety of constitutive or regulatable promoters may be employed. Expression in a microorganism can provide a ready source of the plant enzyme. Among transcriptional initiation regions which have been described are regions from bacterial and yeast hosts, such as <highlight><italic>E. coli, B. subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, </italic></highlight>including genes such as beta-galactosidase, T7 polymerase, tryptophan E and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> For the most part, the constructs will involve regulatory regions functional in plants which provide for modified production of plant kappa hydroxylase with resulting modification of the fatty acid composition. The open reading frame, coding for the plant kappa hydroxylase or functional fragment thereof will be joined at its 5&prime; end to a transcription initiation regulatory region such as the wild-type sequence naturally found 5&prime; upstream to the kappa hydroxylase structural gene. Numerous other transcription initiation regions are available which provide for a wide variety of constitutive or regulatable, e.g., inducible, transcription of the structural gene functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Among transcriptional initiation regions used for plants are such regions associated with the structural genes such as for nopaline and mannopine synthases, or with napin, soybean &bgr;-conglycinin, oleosin, 12S storage protein, the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoters and the like. The transcription/translation initiation regions corresponding to such structural genes are found immediately 5&prime; upstream to the respective start codons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In embodiments wherein the expression of the kappa hydroxylase protein is desired in a plant host, the use of all or part of the complete plant kappa hydroxylase gene is desired; namely all or part of the 5&prime; upstream non-coding regions (promoter) together with the structural gene sequence and 3&prime; downstream non-coding regions may be employed. If a different promoter is desired, such as a promoter native to the plant host of interest or a modified promoter, i.e., having transcription initiation regions derived from one gene source and translation initiation regions derived from a different gene source, including the sequence encoding the plant kappa hydroxylase of interest, or enhanced promoters, such as double 35S CaMV promoters, the sequences may be joined together using standard techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> For such applications when 5&prime; upstream non-coding regions are obtained from other genes regulated during seed maturation, those preferentially expressed in plant embryo tissue, such as transcription initiation control regions from the <highlight><italic>D. napus </italic></highlight>napin gene, or the Arabidopsis 12S storage protein, or soybean &bgr;-conglycinin (Bray et al., 1987), or the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>kappa hydroxylase promoter described herein are desired. Transcription initiation regions which are preferentially expressed in seed tissue, i.e., which are undetectable in other plant parts, are considered desirable for fatty acid modifications in order to minimize any disruptive or adverse effects of the gene product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Regulatory transcript termination regions may be provided in DNA constructs of this invention as well. Transcript termination regions may be provided by the DNA sequence encoding the plant kappa hydroxylase or a convenient transcription termination region derived from a different gene source, for example, the transcript termination region which is naturally associated with the transcript initiation region. Where the transcript termination region is from a different gene source, it will contain at least about 0.5 kb, preferably about 1-3 kb of sequence 3&prime; to the structural gene from which the termination region is derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Plant expression or transcription constructs having a plant kappa hydroxylase as the DNA sequence of interest for increased or decreased expression thereof may be employed with a wide variety of plant life, particularly, plant life involved in the production of vegetable oils for edible and industrial uses. Most especially preferred are temperate oilseed crops. Plants of interest include, but are not limited to rapeseed (Canola and high erucic acid varieties), Crambe, <highlight><italic>Brassica juncea, Brassica nigra</italic></highlight>, meadowfoam, flax, sunflower, safflower, cotton, Cuphea, soybean, peanut, coconut and oil palms and corn. An important criterion in the selection of suitable plants for the introduction on the kappa hydroxylase is the presence in the host plant of a suitable substrate for the hydroxylase. Thus, for example, production of ricinoleic acid will be best accomplished in plants that normally have high levels of oleic acid in seed lipids. Similarly, production of lesquerolic acid will best be accomplished in plants that have high levels of icosenoic acid in seed lipids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Depending on the method for introducing the recombinant constructs into the host cell, other DNA sequences may be required. Importantly, this invention is applicable to dicotyledons and monocotyledons species alike and will be readily applicable to new and/or improved transformation and regulation techniques. The method of transformation is not critical to the current invention; various methods of plant transformation are currently available. As newer methods are available to transform crops, they may be directly applied hereunder. For example, many plant species naturally susceptible to Agrobacterium infection may be successfully transformed via tripartite or binary vector methods of Agrobacterium mediated transformation. In addition, techniques of microinjection, DNA particle bombardment, electroporation have been developed which allow for the transformation of various monocot and dicot plant species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In developing the DNA construct, the various components of the construct or fragments thereof will normally be inserted into a convenient cloning vector which is capable of replication in a bacterial host, e.g., <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>. Numerous vectors exist that have been described in the literature. After each cloning, the plasmid may be isolated and subjected to further manipulation, such as restriction, insertion of new fragments, ligation, deletion, insertion, resection, etc., so as to tailor the components of the desired sequence. Once the construct has been completed, it may then be transferred to an appropriate vector for further manipulation in accordance with the manner of transformation of the host cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Normally, included with the DNA construct will be a structural gene having the necessary regulatory regions for expression in a host and providing for selection of transformant cells. The gene may provide for resistance to a cytotoxic agent, e.g., antibiotic, heavy metal, toxin, etc., complementation providing prototropy to an auxotrophic host, viral immunity or the like. Depending upon the number of different host species the expression construct or components thereof are introduced, one or more markers may be employed, where different conditions for selection are used for the different hosts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the degeneracy of the DNA code provides that some codon substitutions are permissible of DNA sequences without any corresponding modification of the amino acid sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the manner in which the DNA construct is introduced into the plant host is not critical to this invention. Any method which provides for efficient transformation may be employed. Various methods for plant cell transformation include the use of Ti- or Ri-plasmids, microinjection, electroporation, infiltration, imbibition, DNA particle bombardment, liposome fusion, DNA bombardment or the like. In many instances, it will be desirable to have the construct bordered on one or both sides of the T-DNA, particularly having the left and right borders, more particularly the right border. This is particularly useful when the construct uses <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>or <highlight><italic>A. rhizogenes </italic></highlight>as a mode for transformation, although the T-DNA borders may find use with other modes of transformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Where Agrobacterium is used for plant cell transformation, a vector may be used which may be introduced into the Agrobacterium host for homologous recombination with T-DNA or the Ti- or Ri-plasmid present in the Agrobacterium host. The Ti- or Ri-plasmid containing the T-DNA for recombination may be armed (capable of causing gall formation) or disarmed (incapable of causing gall), the latter being permissible, so long as the vir genes are present in the transformed Agrobacterium host. The armed plasmid can give a mixture of normal plant cells and gall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In some instances where Agrobacterium is used as the vehicle for transforming plant cells, the expression construct bordered by the T-DNA border(s) will be inserted into a broad host spectrum vector, there being broad host spectrum vectors described in the literature. Commonly used is pRK2 or derivatives thereof. See, for example, Ditta et al., (1980), which is incorporated herein by reference. Included with the expression construct and the T-DNA will be one or more markers, which allow for selection of transformed Agrobacterium and transformed plant cells. A number of markers have been developed for use with plant cells, such as resistance to kanamycin, the aminoglycoside G418, hygromycin, or the like. The particular marker employed is not essential to this invention, one or another marker being preferred depending on the particular host and the manner of construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> For transformation of plant cells using Agrobacterium, explants may be combined and incubated with the transformed Agrobacterium for sufficient time for transformation, the bacteria killed, and the plant cells cultured in an appropriate selective medium. Once callus forms, shoot formation can be encouraged by employing the appropriate plant hormones in accordance with known methods and the shoots transferred to rooting medium for regeneration of plants. The plants may then be grown to seed and the seed used to establish repetitive generations and for isolation of vegetable oils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Using Hydroxylase Genes to Alter the Activity of Fatty Acid Desaturases </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A widely acknowledged goal of current efforts to improve the nutritional quality of edible plant oils, or to facilitate industrial applications of plant oils, is to alter the level of desaturation of plant storage lipids (Topfer et al., 1995). In particular, in many crop species it is considered desirable to reduce the level of polyunsaturation of storage lipids and to increase the level of oleic acid. The precise amount of the various fatty acids in a particular plant oil varies with the intended application. Thus, it is desirable to have a robust method that will permit genetic manipulation of the level of unsaturation to any desired level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Substantial progress has recently been made in the isolation of genes encoding plant fatty acid desaturases (reviewed in Topfer et al., 1995). These genes have been introduced into various plant species and used to alter the level of fatty acid unsaturation in one of three ways. First, the genes can be placed under transcriptional control of a strong promoter so that the amount of the corresponding enzyme is increased. In some cases this leads to an increase in the amount of the fatty acid that is the product of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. For example, Arondel et al. (1992) increased the amount of linolenic acid (18:3) in tissues of transgenic Arabidopsis plants by placing the endoplasmic reticulum-localized fad3 gene under transcriptional control of the strong constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A second method of using cloned genes to alter the level of fatty acid unsaturation is to cause transcription of all or part of a gene in transgenic tissues so that the transcripts have an antisense orientation relative to the normal mode of transcription. This has been used by a number of laboratories to reduce the level of expression of one or more desaturase genes that have significant nucleotide sequence homology to the gene used in the construction of the antisense gene (reviewed in Topfer et al.). For instance, antisense repression of the oleate &Dgr;12-desaturase in transgenic rapeseed resulted in a strong increase in oleic acid content (cf., Topfer et al., 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> A third method for using cloned genes to alter fatty acid desaturation is to exploit the phenomenon of cosuppression or &ldquo;gene-silencing&rdquo; (Matzke et al., 1995). Although the mechanisms responsible for gene silencing are not known in any detail, it has frequently been observed that in transgenic plants, expression of an introduced gene leads to inactivation of homologous endogenous genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> For example, high-level sense expression of the Arabidopsis fad8 gene, which encodes a chloroplast-localized &Dgr;15-desaturase, in transgenic Arabidopsis plants caused suppression of the endogenous copy of the fad8 gene and the homologous fad7 gene (which encodes an isozyme of the fad8 gene) (Gibson et al., 1994). The fad7 and fad8 genes are only 76% identical at the nucleotide level. At the time of publication, this example represented the most divergent pair of plant genes for which cosuppression had been observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In view of previous evidence concerning the relatively high level of nucleotide sequence homology required to obtain cosuppression, it is not obvious to one skilled in the art that sense expression in transgenic plants of the castor fatty acyl hydroxylase of this invention would significantly alter the amount of unsaturation of storage lipids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> However, we have established that fatty acyl hydroxylase genes can be used for this purpose as taught in Example 4 of this invention. Of particular importance, this invention teaches the use of fatty acyl hydroxylase genes to increase the proportion of oleic acid in transgenic plant tissues. The mechanism by which expression of the gene exerts this effect is not known but may be due to one of several possibilities which are elaborated upon in Example 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples which are included for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The kappa hydroxylase encoded by the previously described fah12 gene from Castor (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/320,982) was used to produce ricinoleic acid, lesquerolic acid, densipolic acid and auricolic acid in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. This example specifically discloses the method taught in Example 2 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/320,982. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> A variety of methods have been developed to insert a DNA sequence of interest into the genome of a plant host to obtain the transcription and translation of the sequence to effect phenotypic changes. The following methods represent only one of many equivalent means of producing transgenic plants and causing expression of the hydroxylase gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Arabidopsis plants were transformed, by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, with the kappa hydroxylase encoded by the Castor fah12 gene on binary Ti plasmid pB6. This plasmid was previously used to transform <highlight><italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic></highlight>for the production of ricinoleic acid (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/320,982). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Inoculums of <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>strain GV3101 containing binary Ti plasmid pB6 were plated on L-broth plates containing 50 &mgr;g/ml kanamycin and incubated for 2 days at 30&deg; C. Single colonies were used to inoculate large liquid cultures (L-broth medium with 50 mg/l rifampicin, 110 mg/l gentamycin and 200 mg/l kanamycin) to be used for the transformation of Arabidopsis plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Arabidopsis plants were transformed by the in planta transformation procedure essentially as described by Bechtold et al., (1993). Cells of <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>GV3101(pB6) were harvested from liquid cultures by centrifugation, then resuspended in infiltration medium at OD<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.8 (Infiltration medium was Murashige and Skoog macro and micronutrient medium (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) containing 10 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine and 5% glucose). Batches of 12-15 plants were grown for 3 to 4 weeks in natural light at a mean daily temperature of approximately 25&deg; C. in 3.5 inch pots containing soil. The intact plants were immersed in the bacterial suspension then transferred to a vacuum chamber and placed under 600 mm of vacuum produced by a laboratory vacuum pump until tissues appeared uniformly water-soaked (approximately 10 min). The plants were grown at 25&deg; C. under continuous light (100 &mgr;mol m<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>s<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>irradiation in the 400 to 700 nm range) for four weeks. The seeds obtained from all the plants in a pot were harvested as one batch. The seeds were sterilized by sequential treatment for 2 min with ethanol followed by 10 min in a mixture of household bleach (Chlorox), water and Tween-80 (50%, 50%, 0.05%) then rinsed thoroughly with sterile water. The seeds were plated at high density (2000 to 4000 per plate) onto agar-solidified medium in 100 mm petri plates containing 1/2&times;Murashige and Skoog salts medium enriched with B5 vitamins (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and containing kanamycin at 50 mg/l. After incubation for 48 h at 4&deg; C. to stimulate germination, seedlings were grown for a period of seven days until transformants were clearly identifiable as healthy green seedlings against a background of chlorotic kanamycin-sensitive seedlings. The transformants were transferred to soil for two weeks before leaf tissue could be used for DNA and lipid analysis. More than 20 transformants were obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> DNA was extracted from young leaves from transformants to verify the presence of an intact fah12 gene. The presence of the transgene in a number of the putative transgenic lines was verified by using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the insert from pB6. The primers used were HF2&equals;GCTCTTTTGTGCGCTCATTC (SEQ ID NO:12) and HR1&equals;CGGTACCAGAAAACGCCTTG (SEQ ID NO:13), which were designed to allow the amplification of a 700 bp fragment. Approximately 100 ng of genomic DNA was added to a solution containing 25 pmol of each primer, 1.5 U Taq polymerase (Boehringer Manheim), 200 uM of dNTPs, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris.Cl (pH 9), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 3% (v/v) formamide, to a final volume of 50 &mgr;l. Amplifications conditions were: 4 min denaturation step at 94&deg; C., followed by 30 cycles of 92&deg; C. for 1 min, 55&deg; C. for 1 min, 72&deg; C. for 2 min. A final extension step closed the program at 72&deg; C. for 5 min. Transformants could be positively identified after visualization of a characteristic 1 kb amplified fragment on an ethidium bromide stained agarose gel. All transgenic lines tested gave a PCR product of a size consistent with the expected genotype, confirming that the lines were, indeed, transgenic. All further experiments were done with three representative transgenic lines of the wild type designated as 1-3, 4D, 7-4 and one transgenic line of the fad2 mutant line JB12. The transgenic JB12 line was included in order to test whether the increased accumulation of oleic acid in this mutant would have an effect on the amount of ricinoleic acid that accumulated in the transgenic plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Analysis of Transgenic Plants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Leaves and seeds from fah12 transgenic Arabidopsis plants were analyzed for the presence of hydroxylated fatty acids using gas chromatography. Lipids were extracted from 100-200 mg leaf tissue or 50 seeds. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) were prepared by placing tissue in 1.5 ml of 1.0 M methanolic HCl (Supelco Co.) in a 13&times;100 mm glass screw-cap tube capped with a teflon-lined cap and heated to 80&deg; C. for 2 hours. Upon cooling, 1 ml petroleum ether was added and the FAMES removed by aspirating off the ether phase which was then dried under a nitrogen stream in a glass tube. One hundred &mgr;l of N,O-bis(Trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA; Pierce Chemical Co) and 200 &mgr;l acetonitrile was added to derivatize the hydroxyl groups. The reaction was carried out at 70&deg; C. for 15 min. The products were dried under nitrogen, redissolved in 100 &mgr;l chloroform and transferred to a gas chromatograph vial. Two &mgr;l of each sample were analyzed on a SP2340 fused silica capillary column (30 m, 0.75 mm ID, 0.20 mm film, Supelco), using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 II series Gas Chromatograph. The samples were not split, the temperature program was 195&deg; C. for 18 min, increased to 230&deg; C. at 25&deg; C./min, held at 230&deg; C. for 5 min then down to 195&deg; C. at 25&deg; C./min., and flame ionization detectors were used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The chromatographic elution time of methyl esters and O-TMS derivatives of ricinoleic acid, lesquerolic acid and auricolic acid was established by GC-MS of lipid samples from seeds of <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>and comparison to published chromatograms of fatty acids from this species (Carlson et al., 1990). A O-TMS-methyl-ricinoleate standard was prepared from ricinoleic acid obtained from Sigma Chemical Co (St, Louis, Mo.). O-TMS-methyl-lesqueroleate and O-TMS-methyl-auricoleate standards were prepared from triacylglycerols purified from seeds of <highlight><italic>L. fendleri</italic></highlight>. The mass spectrum of O-TMS-methyl-ricinoleate, O-TMS-methyl-densipoleate, O-TMS-methyl-lesqueroleate, and O-TMS-methyl-auricoleate are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-D, respectively. The structures of the characteristic ions produced during mass spectrometry of these derivatives are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Lipid extracted from transgenic tissues were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry for the presence of hydroxylated fatty acids. As a matter of reference, the average fatty acid composition of leaves in Arabidopsis wild type and fad2 mutant lines was reported by Miquel and Browse (1992). Gas chromatograms of methylated and silylated fatty acids from seeds of wild type and a fah12 transgenic wild type plant are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and </cross-reference>3B, respectively. The profiles are very similar except for the presence of three small but distinct peaks at 14.3, 15.9 and 18.9 minutes. A very small peak at 20.15 min was also evident. The elution time of the peaks at 14.3 and 18.9 min corresponded precisely to that of comparably prepared ricinoleic and lesquerolic standards, respectively. No significant differences were observed in lipid extracts from leaves or roots of the wild type and the fah12 transgenic wild type lines (Table 1). Thus, in spite of the fact that the fah12 gene is expressed throughout the plant, we observed effects on fatty acid composition only in seed tissue. A similar observation was described previously for transgenic fah12 tobacco in patent application Ser. No. 08/320,982.

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In order to confirm that the observed new peaks in the transgenic lines corresponded to derivatives of ricinoleic, lesquerolic, densipolic and auricolic acids, mass spectrometry was used. The fatty acid derivatives were resolved by gas chromatography as described above except that a Hewlett-Packard 5971 series mass selective detector was used in place of the flame ionization detector used in the previous experiment. The spectra of the four new peaks in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> (peak numbers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-D, respectively. Comparison of the spectrum obtained for the standards with that obtained for the four peaks from the transgenic lines confirms the identity of the four new peaks. On the basis of the three characteristic peaks at M/Z 187, 270 and 299, peak <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is unambiguously identified as O-TMS-methylricinoleate. On the basis of the three characteristic peaks at M/Z 185, 270 and 299, peak <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is unambiguously identified as O-TMS-methyldensipoleate. On the basis of the three characteristic peaks at M/Z 187, 298 and 327, peak <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is unambiguously identified as O-TMS-methyllesqueroleate. On the basis of the three characteristic peaks at M/Z 185, 298 and 327, peak <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is unambiguously identified as O-TMS-methylauricoleate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> These results unequivocally demonstrate the identity of the fah12 cDNA as encoding a hydroxylase that hydroxylates both oleic acid to produce ricinoleic acid and also hydroxylates icosenoic acid to produce lesquerolic acid. These results also provide additional evidence that the hydroxylase can be functionally expressed in a heterologous plant species in such a way that the enzyme is catalytically functional. These results also demonstrate that expression of this hydroxylase gene leads to accumulation of ricinoleic, lesquerolic, densipolic and auricolic acids in a plant species that does not normally accumulate hydroxylated fatty acids in extractable lipids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The presence of lesquerolic acid in the transgenic plants was anticipated in the previous patent application (Ser. No. 08/320,982) based on the biochemical evidence suggesting broad substrate specificity of the kappa hydroxylase. By contrast, the accumulation of densipolic and auricolic acids was less predictable. Since Arabidopsis does not normally contain significant quantities of the non-hydroxylated precursors of these fatty acids which could serve as substrates for the hydroxylase, it appears that one or more of the three n-3 fatty acid desaturases known in Arabidopsis (eg., fad3, fad7, fad8; reviewed in Gibson et al., 1995) are capable of desaturating the hydroxylated compounds at the n-3 position. That is, densipolic acid is produced by the action of an n-3 desaturase on ricinoleic acid. Auricolic acid is produced by the action of an n-3 desaturase on lesquerolic acid. Because it is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, the fad3 desaturase is almost certainly responsible. This can be tested in the future by producing fah12-containing transgenic plants of the fad3-deficient mutant of Arabidopsis (similar experiments can be done with fad7 and fad8). It is also formally possible that the enzymes that normally elongate 18:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;9 </superscript></highlight>to 20:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;11 </superscript></highlight>may elongate 12OH-18:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;9 </superscript></highlight>to 14OH-20:1<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;11</superscript></highlight>, and 12OH-18:2<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;9, 15 </superscript></highlight>to 14OH-20:2<highlight><superscript>cis&Dgr;11, 17</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The amount of the various fatty acids in seed, leaf and root lipids of the control and transgenic plants is also presented in Table 1. Although the amount of hydroxylated fatty acids produced in this example is less than desired for commercial production of ricinoleate and other hydroxylated fatty acids from plants, we envision numerous improvements of this invention that will increase the level of accumulation of hydroxylated fatty acids in plants that express the fah12 or related hydroxylase genes. Improvements in the level and tissue specificity of expression of the hydroxylase gene is envisioned. Methods to accomplish this by the use of strong, seed-specific promoters such as the <highlight><italic>B. napus </italic></highlight>napin promoter or the native promoters of the castor fah12 gene or the corresponding hydroxylase gene from <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>will be obvious to one skilled in the art. Additional improvements are envisioned to involve modification of the enzymes which cleave hydroxylated fatty acids from phosphatidylcholine, reduction in the activities of enzymes which degrade hydroxylated fatty acids and replacement of acyltransferases which transfer hydroxylated fatty acids to the sn-1, sn-2 and sn-3 positions of glycerolipids. Although genes for these enzymes have not been described in the scientific literature, their utility in improving the level of production of hydroxylated fatty acids can be readily envisioned based on the results of biochemical investigations of ricinoleate synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Although Arabidopsis is not an economically important plant species, it is widely accepted by plant biologists as a model for higher plants. Therefore, the inclusion of this example is intended to demonstrate the general utility of the invention described here and in the previous application (Ser. No. 08/320,982) to the modification of oil composition in higher plants. One advantage of studying the expression of this novel gene in Arabidopsis is the existence in this system of a large body of knowledge on lipid metabolism, as well as the availability of a collection of mutants which can be used to provide useful information on the biochemistry of fatty acid hydroxylation in plant species. Another advantage is the ease of transposing any of the information obtained on metabolism of ricinoleate in Arabidopsis to closely related species such as the crop plants <highlight><italic>Brassica napus, Brassica juncea </italic></highlight>or <highlight><italic>Crambe abyssinica </italic></highlight>in order to mass produce ricinoleate, lesqueroleate or other hydroxylated fatty acids for industrial use. The kappa hydroxylase is useful for the production of ricinoleate or lesqueroleate in any plant species that accumulates significant levels of the precursors, oleic acid and icosenoic acid. Of particular interest are genetically modified varieties that accumulate high levels of oleic acid. Such varieties are currently available for sunflower and Canola. Production of lesquerolic acid and related hydroxy fatty acids can be achieved in species that accumulate high levels of icosenoic acid or other long chain monoenoic acids. Such plants may in the future be produced by genetic engineering of plants that do not normally make such precursors. Thus, we envision that the use of the kappa hydroxylase is of general utility. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Overview </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Regions of nucleotide sequence that were conserved in both the Castor kappa hydroxylase and the Arabidopsis fad2 &Dgr;12 fatty acid desaturase were used to design oligonucleotide primers. These were used with genomic DNA from <highlight><italic>Lesquerella fendleri </italic></highlight>to amplify fragments of several homologous genes. These amplified fragments were then used as hybridization probes to identify full length genomic clones from a genomic library of <highlight><italic>L. fendleri. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Hydroxylated fatty acids are specific to the seed tissue of Lesquerella sp., and are not found to any appreciable extent in vegetative tissues. One of the two genes identified by this method was expressed in both leaves and developing seeds and is therefore thought to correspond to the &Dgr;12 fatty acid desaturase. The other gene was expressed at high levels in developing seeds but was not expressed or was expressed at very low levels in leaves and is the kappa hydroxylase from this species. The identity of the gene as a fatty acyl hydroxylase was established by functional expression of the gene in yeast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The identity of this gene will also be established by introducing the gene into transgenic Arabidopsis plants and showing that it causes the accumulation of ricinoleic acid, lesquerolic acid, densipolic acid and auricolic acid in seed lipids. The promoter of this gene is also of utility because it is able to direct expression of a gene specifically in developing seeds at a time when storage lipids are accumulating. This promoter is, therefore, of great utility for many applications in the genetic engineering of seeds, particularly in members of the Brassicacea. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The various steps involved in this process are described in detail below. Unless otherwise indicated, routine methods for manipulating nucleic acids, bacteria and phage were as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Isolation of a Fragment of the Lesguerella Kappa Hydroxylase Gene </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> oligonucleotide primers for the amplification of the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>kappa hydroxylase were designed by choosing regions of high deduced amino acid sequence homology between the Castor kappa hydroxylase and the Arabidopsis &Dgr;12 desaturase (fad2). Because most amino acids are encoded by several different codons, these oligonucleotides were designed to encode all possible codons that could encode the corresponding amino acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The sequence of these mixed oligonucleotides was: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Oligo 1: TAYWSNCAYMGNMGNCAYCA (SEQ ID NO:14) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Oligo 2: RTGRTGNGCNACRTGNGTRTC (SEQ ID NO:15) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> (Where: Y&equals;C&plus;T; W&equals;A&plus;T; S&equals;G&plus;C; N&equals;A&plus;G&plus;C&plus;T; M&equals;A&plus;C; R&equals;A&plus;G) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> These oligonucleotides were used to amplify a fragment of DNA from <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following conditions: Approximately 100 ng of genomic DNA was added to a solution containing 25 pmol of each primer, 1.5 U Taq polymerase (Boehringer Manheim), 200 uM of dNTPs, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris.Cl (pH 9), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 3% (v/v) formamide, to a final volume of 50 &mgr;l. Amplifications conditions were: 4 min denaturation step at 94&deg; C., followed by 30 cycles of 92&deg; C. for 1 min, 55&deg; C. for 1 min, 72&deg; C. for 2 min. A final extension step closed the program at 72&deg; C. for 5 min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> PCR products of approximately 540 bp were observed following electrophoretic separation of the products of the PCR reaction in agarose gels. Two of these fragments were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) to give rise to plasmids pLesq2 and pLesq3. The sequence of the inserts in these two plasmids was determined by the chain termination method. The sequence of the insert in pLesq2 is presented as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:1) and the sequence of the insert in pLesq3 is presented as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:2). The high degree of sequence identity between the two clones indicated that they were both potential candidates to be either a &Dgr;12 desaturase or a gamma hydroxylase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Northern Analysis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In <highlight><italic>L. fendleri</italic></highlight>, hydroxylated fatty acids are found in large amounts in seed oils but are not found in appreciable amounts in leaves. An important criterion in discriminating between a fatty acyl desaturase and kappa hydroxylase is that the kappa hydroxylase gene is expected to be expressed more highly in tissues which have high level of hydroxylated fatty acids than in other tissues. In contrast, all plant tissues should contain mRNA for an &ohgr;6 fatty acyl desaturase since diunsaturated fatty acids are found in the lipids of all tissues in most or all plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it was of great interest to determine whether the gene corresponding to pLesq2 was also expressed only in seeds, or is also expressed in other tissues. This question was addressed by testing for hybridization of pLesq2 to RNA purified from developing seeds and from leaves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Total RNA was purified from developing seeds and young leaves of <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>using an Rneasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. RNA concentrations were quantified by UV spectrophotometry at &lgr;&equals;260 and 280 nm. In order to ensure even loading of the gel to be used for Northern blotting, RNA concentrations were further adjusted after recording fluorescence under UV light of RNA samples stained with ethidium bromide and run on a test denaturing gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Total RNA prepared as described above from leaves and developing seeds was electrophoresed through an agarose gel containing formaldehyde (Iba et al., 1993). An equal quantity (10 &mgr;g) of RNA was loaded in both lanes, and RNA standards (0.16-1.77 kb ladder, Gibco-BRL) were loaded in a third lane. Following electrophoresis, RNA was transferred from the gel to a nylon membrane (Hybond N&plus;, Amersham) and fixed to the filter by exposure to UV light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> A <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labelled probe was prepared from insert DNA of clone pLesq2 by random priming and hybridized to the membrane overnight at 52&deg; C., after it had been prehybridized for 2 h. The prehybridization solution contained 5&times;SSC, 10&times;Denhardt&apos;s solution, 0.1 SDS, 0.1 M KPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>pH 6.8, 100 &mgr;g/ml salmon sperm DNA. The hybridization solution had the same basic composition, but no SDS, and it contained 10% dextran sulfate and 30% formamide. The blot was washed once in 2&times;SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65&deg; C. then in 1&times;SSC at the same temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Brief (30 min) exposure of the blot to X-ray film revealed that the probe pLesq2 hybridized to a single band only in the seed RNA lane (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The blot was re-probed with the insert from pLesq3 gene, which gave bands of similar intensity in the seed and leaf lanes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> These results show that the gene corresponding to the clone pLesq2 is highly and specifically expressed in seed of <highlight><italic>L. fendleri</italic></highlight>. In conjunction with knowledge of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence, strong seed-specific expression of the gene corresponding to the insert in pLesq2 is a convincing indicator of the role of the enzyme in synthesis of hydroxylated fatty acids in the seed oil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Characterization of a Genomic Clone of the Gamma Hydroxylase </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Genomic DNA was prepared from young leaves of <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>as described by Murray and Thompson (1980). A Sau3AI-partial digest genomic library constructed in the vector &lgr;DashII (Stratagene, 11011 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, Calif. 92037) was prepared by partially digesting 500 &mgr;g of DNA, size-selecting the DNA on a sucrose gradient (Sambrook et al., 1989), and ligating the DNA (12 kb average size) to the BamHI-digested arms of &lgr;DashII. The entire ligation was packaged according to the manufacturer&apos;s conditions and plated on <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain XL1-Blue MRA-P2 (Stratagene). This yielded 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>primary recombinant clones. The library was then amplified according to the manufacturer&apos;s conditions. A fraction of the genomic library was plated on <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>XL1-Blue and resulting plaques (150,000) were lifted to charged nylon membranes (Hybond N&plus;, Amersham), according to the manufacturer&apos;s conditions. DNA was crosslinked to the filters under UV in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Several clones carrying genomic sequences corresponding to the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>hydroxylase were isolated by probing the membranes with the insert from pLesq2 that was PCR-amplified with internal primers and labelled with <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P by random priming. The filters were prehybridized for 2 hours at 65&deg; C. in 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(pH 7.2), 1% BSA and hybridized to the probe for 16 hours in the same solution. The filters were sequentially washed at 65&deg; C. in solutions containing 2&times;SSC, 1&times;SSC, 0.5&times;SSC in addition to 0.1% SDS. A 2.6 kb Xba I fragment containing the complete coding sequence for the gamma-hydroxylase and approximately 1 kb of the 5&prime; upstream region was subcloned into the corresponding site of pBluescript KS to produce plasmid pLesq-Hyd and the sequence determined completely using an automatic sequencer by the dideoxy chain termination method. Sequence data was analyzed using the program DNASIS (Hitachi Company). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The sequence of the insert in clone pLesq-Hyd is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-B. The sequence entails 1855 bp of contiguous DNA sequence (SEQ ID NO:3). The clone encodes a 401 bp 5&prime; untranslated region (i.e., nucleotides preceding the first ATG codon), an 1152 bp open reading frame, and a 302 bp 3&prime; untranslated region. The open reading frame encodes a 384 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 44,370 (SEQ ID NO:4). The amino terminus lacks features of a typical signal peptide (von Heijne, 1985). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The exact translation-initiation methionine has not been experimentally determined, but on the basis of deduced amino acid sequence homology to the Castor kappa hydroxylase (noted below) is thought to be the methionine encoded by the first ATG codon at nucleotide 402. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Comparison of the pLesq-Hyd deduced amino acid sequence with sequences of membrane-bound desaturases and the castor hydroxylase (FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-B) indicates that pLesq-Hyd is homologous to these genes. This figure shows an alignment of the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>hydroxylase (SEQ ID NO:4) with the castor hydroxylase (van de Loo et al. 1995), the Arabidopsis fad2 cDNA which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum-localized &Dgr;12 desaturase (called fad2) (Okuley et al., 1994), two soybean fad2 desaturase clones, a <highlight><italic>Brassica napus </italic></highlight>fad2 clone, a <highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>fad2 clone and partial sequence of a <highlight><italic>R. communis </italic></highlight>fad2 clone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The high degree of sequence homology indicates that the gene products are of similar function. For instance, the overall homology between the Lesquerella hydroxylase and the Arabidopsis fad2 desaturase was 92.2% similarity and 84.8% identity and the two sequences differed in length by only one amino acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Southern Hybridization </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Southern analysis was used to examine the copy number of the genes in the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>genome corresponding to the clone pLesq-Hyd. Genomic DNA (5 &mgr;g) was digested with EcoR I, Hind III and Xba I and separated on a 0.9% agarose gel. DNA was alkali-blotted to a charged nylon membrane (Hybond N&plus;, Amersham), according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol. The blot was prehybridized for 2 hours at 65&deg; C. in 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>(pH 7.2), 1% BSA and hybridized to the probe for 16 hours in the same solution with pLesq-Hyd insert PCR-amplified with internal primers and labelled with <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P by random priming. The filters were sequentially washed at 65&deg; C. in solutions containing 2&times;SSC, 1&times;SSC, 0.5&times;SSC in addition to 0.1% SDS, then exposed to X-ray film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The probe hybridized with a single band in each digest of <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>DNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>), indicating that the gene from which pLesq-Hyd was transcribed is present in a single copy in the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>genome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Expression of pLesq-Hyd in Transgenic Plants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> There are a wide variety of plant promoter sequences which may be used to cause tissue-specific expression of cloned genes in transgenic plants. For instance, the napin promoter and the acyl carrier protein promoters have previously been used in the modification of seed oil composition by expression of an antisense form of a desaturase (Knutson et al. 1992). Similarly, the promoter for the &bgr;-subunit of soybean &bgr;-conglycinin has been shown to be highly active and to result in tissue-specific expression in transgenic plants of species other than soybean (Bray et al., 1987). Thus, although we describe the use of the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>kappa hydroxylase promoter in the examples described here, other promoters which lead to seed-specific expression may also be employed for the production of modified seed oil composition. Such modifications of the invention described here will be obvious to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Constructs for expression of <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>kappa hydroxylase in plant cells are prepared as follows: A 13 kb SalI fragment containing the pLesq-Hyg gene was ligated into the XhoI site of binary Ti plasmid vector pSLJ44026 (Jones et al., 1992) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) to produce plasmid pTi-Hyd and transformed into <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>strains GV3101 by electroporation. Strain GV3101 (Koncz and Schell, 1986) contains a disarmed Ti plasmid. Cells for electroporation were prepared as follows. GV3101 was grown in LB medium with reduced NaCl (5 g/l). A 250 ml culture was grown to OD<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.6, then centrifuged at 4000 rpm (Sorvall GS-A rotor) for 15 min. The supernatant was aspirated immediately from the loose pellet, which was gently resuspended in 500 ml ice-cold water. The cells were centrifuged as before, resuspended in 30 ml ice-cold water, transferred to a 30 ml tube and centrifuged at 5000 rpm (Sorvall SS-34 rotor) for 5 min. This was repeated three times, resuspending the cells consecutively in 30 ml ice-cold water, 30 ml ice-cold 10% glycerol, and finally in 0.75 ml ice-cold 10% glycerol. These cells were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &minus;80&deg; C. Electroporations employed a Biorad Gene pulsar instrument using cold 2 mm-gap cuvettes containing 40 &mgr;l cells and 1 &mgr;l of DNA in water, at a voltage of 2.5 KV, and 200 Ohms resistance. The electroporated cells were diluted with 1 ml SOC medium (Sambrook et al., 1989, page A2) and incubated at 28&deg; C. for 2-4 h before plating on medium containing kanamycin (50 mg/l). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>can be transformed with the Agrobacterium cells containing pTi-Hyd as described in Example 1 above. Similarly, the presence of hydroxylated fatty acids in the transgeneic Arabidopsis plants can be demonstrated by the methods described in Example 1 above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Constitutive Expression of the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>Hydroxylase in Transgenic Plants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> A 1.5 kb EcoR I fragment from pLesq-Hyg comprising the entire coding region of the hydroxylase was gel purified, then cloned into the corresponding site of pBluescript KS (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA from a number of recombinant clones was then restricted with Pst I, which should cut only once in the insert and once in the vector polylinker sequence. Release of a 920 bp fragment with Pst I indicated the right orientation of the insert for further manipulations. DNA from one such clone was further restricted with SalI, the 5&prime; overhangs filled-in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, then cut with Sac I. The insert fragment was gel purified, and cloned between the Sma I and Sac I sites of pBI121 (Clontech) behind the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter. After checking that the sequence of the junction between insert and vector DNA was appropriate, plasmid DNA from a recombinant clone was used to transform <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>(GV3101). Kanamycin resistant colonies were then used for in planta transformation of <highlight><italic>A. thaliana </italic></highlight>as previously described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> DNA was extracted from kanamycin resistant seedlings and used to PCR-amplify selected fragments from the hydroxylase using nested primers. When fragments of the expected size could be amplified, corresponding plants were grown in the greenhouse or on agar plates, and fatty acids extracted from fully expanded leaves, roots and dry seeds. GC-MS analysis was then performed as previously described to characterize the different fatty acid species and detect accumulation of hydroxy fatty acids in transgenic tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Expression of the Lesquerella Hydroxylase in Yeast </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In order to demonstrate that the cloned <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>gene encoded an oleate-12 hydroxylase, the gene was expressed in yeast cells under transcriptional control of an inducible promoter and the yeast cells were examined for the presence of hydroxylated fatty acids by GC-MS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> In a first step, a lambda genomic clone containing the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>hydroxylase gene was cut with EcoRI, and a resulting 1400 bp fragment containing the coding sequence of the hydroxylase gene was subcloned in the EcoRI site of the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene). This subclone, pLesqcod, contains the coding region of the Lesquerella hydroxylase plus some additional 3&prime; sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In a second step, pLesqcod was cut with HindIII and XbaI, and the insert fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites of the yeast expression vector pYes2 (In Vitrogen; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). This subclone, pLesqYes, contains the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>hydroxylase in the sense orientation relative to the 3&prime; side of the Gal1 promoter. This promoter is inducible by the addition of galactose to the growth medium, and is repressed upon addition of glucose. In addition, the vector carries origins of replication allowing the propagation of pLesqYes in both yeast and <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>

Cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in about 200 &mgr;l of supernatant. 40 &mgr;l aliquots of the cell suspension were then mixed with 1-2 &mgr;g DNA and electroporated in 2 mm-gap cuvettes using a Biorad Gene Pulser instrument set at 600 V, 200&OHgr;, 25 &mgr;F. 160 &mgr;l YPD was added and the cells were plated on selective medium containing glucose. Selective medium consisted of 6.7 g yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 0.4 g casamino acids (Difco), 0.02 g adenine sulfate, 0.03 g L-leucine, 0.02 g L-tryptophan, 0.03 g L-lysine-HCl, 0.03 g L-histidine-HCl, 2-glucose, water to 1 liter.

<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Cells from 2.5 ml of culture were pelleted at 1800 g, and the supernatant was aspirated as completely as possible. Pellets were then dispersed in 1 ml of 1 N methanolic HCl (Supelco, Bellafonte, Pa.). Transmethylation and derivatization of hydroxy fatty acids were performed as described above. After drying under nitrogen, samples were redissolved in 50 &mgr;l chloroform before being analyzed by GC-MS. Samples were injected into an SP2330 fused-silica capillary column (30 m&times;0.25 mm ID, 0.25 &mgr;m film thickness, Supelco). The temperature profile was 100-160&deg; C., 25&deg; C./min, 160-230&deg; C., 10&deg; C./min, 230&deg; C., 3 min, 230-100&deg; C., 25&deg; C./min. Flow rate was 0.9 ml/min.

<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Gas chromatograms of derivatized fatty acid methyl esters from induced cultures of yeast containing pLesqYes contained a novel peak that eluted at 7.6 min (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). O-TMS methyl ricinoleate eluted at exactly the same position on control chromatograms. This peak was not present in cultures lacking pLesqYes or in cultures containing pLesqYes grown on glucose (repressing conditions) rather than galactose (inducing conditions). Mass spectrometry of the peak (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) revealed that the peak has the same spectrum as O-TMS methyl ricinoleate. Thus, on the basis of chromatographic retention time and mass spectrum, it was concluded that the peak corresponded to O-TMS methyl ricinoleate. The presence of ricinoleate in the transgenic yeast cultures confirms the identity of the gene as a kappa hydroxylase of this invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Obtaining Other Plant Fatty Acyl Hydroxylases </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> In a previous patent application, we described the ways in which the castor fah12 sequence could be used to identify other kappa hydroxylases by methods such as PCR and heterologous hybridization. However, because of the high degree of sequence similarity between &Dgr;12 desaturases and kappa hydroxylases, prior art does not teach how to distinguish between the two kinds of enzymes without a functional test such as demonstrating activity in transgenic plants or another suitable host (e.g., transgenic microbial or animal cells). The identification of the <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>hydroxylase provided for the development of criteria by which a hydroxylase and a desaturase may be distinguished solely on the basis of deduced amino acid sequence information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A-B show a sequence alignment of the castor and <highlight><italic>L. fendleri </italic></highlight>hydroxylase sequences with the castor hydroxylase sequence and all publicly available sequences for all plant microsomal &Dgr;12 fatty acid desaturases. Of the 384 amino acid residues in the castor hydroxylase sequence, more than 95% are identical to the corresponding residue in at least one of the desaturase sequences. Therefore, none of these residues are responsible for the catalytic differences between the hydroxylase and the desaturases. Of the remaining 16 residues in the castor hydroxylase and 14 residues in the Lesquerella hydroxylase, all but six represent instances where the hydroxylase sequence has a conservative substitution compared with one or more of the desaturase sequences, or there is wide variability in the amino acid at that position in the various desaturases. By conservative, we mean that the following amino acids are functionally equivalent: Ser/Thr, Ile/Leu/Val/Met, Asp/Glu. Thus, these structural differences also cannot account for the catalytic differences between the desaturases and hydroxylases. This leaves just six amino acid residues where both the castor hydroxylase and the Lesquerella hydroxylase differ from all of the known desaturases and where all of the known microsomal &Dgr;12 desaturases have the identical amino acid residue. These residues occur at positions 69, 111, 155, 226, 304 and 331 of the alignment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Therefore, these six sites distinguish hydroxylases from desaturases. Based on this analysis, we claim that any enzyme with greater than 60% sequence identity to one of the enzymes listed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> can be classified as a hydroxylase if it differs from the sequence of the desaturases at these six positions. Because of slight differences in the number of residues in a particular protein, the numbering may vary from protein to protein but the intent of the number system will be evident if the protein in question is aligned with the castor hydroxylase using the numbering system shown herein. Thus, in conjunction with the methods for using the Lesquerella hydroxylase gene to isolate homologous genes, the structural criterion disclosed here teaches how to isolate and identify plant kappa hydroxylase genes for the purpose of genetically modifying fatty acid composition as disclosed herein and in the previous application (Ser. No. 08/320,982). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In considering which of the six substitutions are solely or primarily responsible for the difference in catalytic activity of the hydroxylases of this invention and the desaturases, we consider it likely that the substitution of a Phe for a Tyr at position 226 may be solely responsible for this difference in catalytic activity because of the known participation of tyrosine radicals in enzyme catalysis. Other substitutions, such as the Ala for Ser at position 331 may have effects at modulating the overall rate of the reaction. On this basis we envision creating novel kappa hydroxylases by site directed mutagenesis of &Dgr;12 desaturases. We also envision converting &Dgr;15 desaturases and &Dgr;9 desaturases to hydroxylases by similar use of site-directed mutagenesis. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The results in Table 2 show that expression of the castor hydroxylase in transgenic Arabidopsis plants caused a substantial increase in the amount of oleic acid (18:1) in the seed lipids and an approximately corresponding decrease in the amount of linoleic acid (18:2). The average amount of oleic acid in the six transgenic lines was 29.9% versus 14.7% in the wild type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> The mechanism by which expression of the castor hydroxylase gene causes increased accumulation of oleic acid is not known. An understanding of the mechanism is not required in order to exploit this invention for the directed alteration of plant lipid fatty acid composition. Furthermore, it will be recognized by one skilled in the art that many improvements of this invention may be envisioned. Of particular interest will be the use of other promoters which have high levels of seed-specific expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Since hydroxylated fatty acids were not detected in the seed lipids of transgenic line 1-2b, it seems likely that it is not the presence of hydroxylated fatty acids per se that causes the effect of the castor hydroxylase gene on desaturase activity. We speculate that there may be a protein-protein interaction between the hydroxylase and the &Dgr;12-oleate desaturase or another protein required for the overall reaction (eg., cytochrome b5) or for the regulation of desaturase activity. We envision that the interaction between the hydroxylase and this other protein suppresses the activity of the desaturase. For instance, the quaternary structure of the membrane-bound desaturases has not been established. It is possible that these enzymes are active as dimers or as multimeric complexes containing more than two subunits. Thus, if dimers or multimers formed between the desaturase and the hydroxylase, the presence of the hydroxylase in the complex may disrupt the activity of the desaturase. This general hypothesis will be tested directly by the production of transgenic plants in which the hydroxylase enzyme has been rendered inactive by the elimination of one or more of the histidine residues that have been proposed to bind iron molecules required for catalysis. Several of these histidine residues have been shown to be essential for catalysis by site directed mutagenesis (Shanklin et al., 1994). Codons encoding histidine residues in the castor hydroxylase gene described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/320,982 will be changed to alanine residues as described by Shanklin et al. (1994). The modified genes will be introduced into transgenic plants of Arabidopsis and possibly other species such as tobacco by the methods described in Example 1 of this application or in Example 1 of the original version of this application (U.S. application Ser. No. 08/320,982). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In order to examine the effect on all tissues, the strong constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter will be used to cause transcription of the modified genes. However, it will be recognized that in order to specifically examine the effect of expression of the mutant gene on seed lipids, a seed-specific promoter such as the <highlight><italic>B. napus </italic></highlight>napin promoter or the promoter described in Example 2, above, may be used. An expected outcome is that expression of the inactive hydroxylase protein in transgenic plants will inhibit the activity of the endoplasmic reticulum-localized &Dgr;12-desaturase. Maximum inhibition will be obtained by expressing high levels of the mutant protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of this invention, we envision that mutations that inactivate other hydroxylases, such as the Lesquerella hydroxylase of this invention, will also be useful for decreasing the amount of endoplasmic reticulum-localized &Dgr;12-desaturase activity in the same way as the castor gene. In a further embodiment of this invention, we also envision that similar mutations of desaturase genes may be used to inactivate endogenous desaturases. Thus, we envision that expression of catalytically inactive fad2 gene from Arabidopsis in transgenic Arabidopsis will inhibit the activity of the endogenous fad2 gene product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Similarly, we envision that expression of the catalytically inactive forms of the &Dgr;12-desaturase from Arabidopsis or other plants in transgenic soybean in transgenic rapeseed, Crambe, Brassica juncea, Canola, flax, sunflower, safflower, cotton, cuphea, soybean, peanut, coconut, oil palm and corn will lead to inactivation of endogenous &Dgr;12-desaturase activity in these species. In a further embodiment of this invention we envision that expression of catalytically inactive forms of other desaturases such as the &Dgr;15-desaturases will lead to inactivation of the corresponding desaturases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Whatever the precise basis for the inhibitory effect of the castor hydroxylase on desaturation, because the castor hydroxylase has very low nucleotide sequence homology (i.e., about 67%) to the Arabidopsis fad2 gene (encoding the endoplasmic reticulum-localized &Dgr;12-desaturase) we envision that the inhibitory effect of this gene, which we provisionally call &ldquo;protein-mediated inhibition&rdquo; (&ldquo;protibition&rdquo;), will have broad utility because it does not depend on a high degree of nucleotide sequence homology between the transgene and the endogenous target gene. In particular, we envision that the castor hydroxylase may be used to inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum-localized &Dgr;12-desaturase activity of all higher plants. Of particular relevance are those species used for oil production. These include but are not limited to rapeseed, Crambe, Brassica juncea, Canola, flax, sunflower, safflower, cotton, cuphea, soybean, peanut, coconut, oil palm and corn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Concluding Remarks </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> By the above examples, demonstration of is critical factors in the production of novel hydroxylated fatty acids by expression of a kappa hydroxylase gene from Castor in transgenic plants is described. In addition, a complete cDNA sequence of the <highlight><italic>Lesquerella fendleri </italic></highlight>kappa hydroxylase is also provided. A full sequence of the castor hydroxylase is also given with various constructs for use in host cells. Through this invention, one can obtain the amino acid and nucleic acid sequences which encode plant fatty acyl hydroxylases from a variety of sources and for a variety of applications. Also revealed is a novel method by which the level of fatty acid desaturation can be altered in a directed way through the use of genetically altered hydroxylase or desaturase genes. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of the invention, embodied for example as computer executable instructions stored on a computer readable medium and executed on a personal computer, includes obtaining a first filter profile for an audio conditioning unit of a sound conditioning system. The first filter profile corresponds to an audiogram of a user of the system. Sound data corresponding to audio to be played is obtained and filtered using the first filter profile. The filtered sound data is played for the user of the sound conditioning system. The user can adjust the first filter profile for current hearing capabilities and specific sound environments without the aid of an audiologist. Multiple filter profiles can be uploaded from the personal computer to an audio conditioning unit of a listening conditioning system. The listening conditioning system includes multiple effective displacement compression units which capture sound at multiple sources and wirelessly transmit raw sound data to the audio conditioning unit, thus providing multi-channel capabilities. Filtered sound data is transmitted to one or more audio delivery components. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to hearing aids and other listening conditioning systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to a listening conditioning system and a method of establishing and updating filter profiles for the listening conditioning system to accommodate for changes in the hearing of the user of the system and/or for new sound environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hearing aids and other listening conditioning systems are well known in the art. Many of these devices or systems utilize a filter profile established by an audiologist to filter sound in order to compensate for the specific hearing loss, capabilities or preferences of the user. Some of these systems allow the user to select from multiple different filter profiles for different sound environments to which the user may be exposed. The filter profile(s) are determined after the user of the system takes an audiogram test under the supervision of the audiologist or a technician. This is a time consuming process, which may or may not require the user of the listening conditioning system to leave components of the system with the audiologist or the manufacturer for programming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> If the user of the listening conditioning system wishes to establish a new filter profile for a sound environment not previously addressed by the available filter profiles, he or she may again have to return to the audiologist for help in doing so. This is again time consuming and potentially costly. Some prior art systems have allowed the user to adjust some of the operational parameters (volume, etc) of the filter profiles. Prior art systems which allow the user to adjust the operational parameters of the filter profiles may not do so based upon an audiogram. Further, these systems may not provide the user a mechanism for evaluating and fine tuning these adjustments prior to use in a particular sound environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> People frequently experience changes in hearing capability or preference caused by temporary physical ailments such as colds. These changes in hearing capability can also be more permanent in nature. When the user of a listening conditioning system configured by an audiologist experiences a change in hearing, the corresponding necessary adjustment of the filter profile(s) again typically requires the aid of an audiologist. Once again, this can be a time consuming and expensive process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Many hearing aids and sound conditioning systems suffer from significant signal-to-noise ratio problems due to noisy sound environments and attenuation of the sound waves as they travel from the source of sound to the microphone. Further, when used in environments in which more than one primary source of sound is important, these systems have limitations since regardless of where the microphone is positioned, at least one source of sound will likely not be positioned close enough to the microphone to avoid significant loss of the audible signal. These and other problems with many prior art listening conditioning systems limit their usefulness in some manner. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A method of the invention, embodied for example as computer executable instructions stored on a computer readable medium and executed on a personal computer, includes obtaining a first filter profile for an audio conditioning unit of a sound conditioning system. The first filter profile corresponds to an audiogram of a user of the system. Sound data corresponding to audio to be played is obtained and filtered using the first filter profile. The filtered sound data is played for the user of the sound conditioning system. The user can adjust the first filter profile for current hearing capabilities and specific sound environments without the aid of an audiologist. Multiple filter profiles can be uploaded from the personal computer to an audio conditioning unit of a listening conditioning system. The listening conditioning system includes multiple effective displacement compression units which capture sound at multiple sources and wirelessly transmit raw sound data to the audio conditioning unit, thus providing multi-channel capabilities. Filtered sound data is transmitted to one or more audio delivery components.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the related discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable desktop computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in which portions of the invention may be implemented. Although not required, the invention will be described, at least in part, in the general context of computer-executable instructions such as an application program being executed by a personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The user of the listening conditioning system of the present invention can utilize the personal computer to run an application program which develops filter profiles, tailored to the current hearing abilities of the user for multiple sound environments, which can be uploaded to the listening conditioning system. The application program and associated methods, as well as the listening conditioning system, are discussed below in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exemplary system for implementing personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (or other similar computing devices such as hand-held or laptop computers) includes a processing unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a system memory <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and a system bus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that couples various system components including the system memory <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the processing unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The system memory <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> typically includes read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. A basic input/output system (BIOS) <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which helps to transfer information between elements within the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, can be stored in ROM <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> further includes a hard disk drive <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for reading from and writing to a hard disk (not shown), a magnetic disk drive <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for reading from or writing to removable magnetic disk <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, and an optical disk drive <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for reading from or writing to a removable optical disk <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> such as a CD ROM or other optical media. The drives and the associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media, which can store data that is accessible by a computer, can be used in conjunction with computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in implementing the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A number of program modules may be stored on the hard disk <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, magnetic disk <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, optical disk <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, ROM <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or RAM <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, including an operating system <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, one or more application programs <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and program data <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. A user may enter commands and information into the computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through input devices such as a keyboard <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, pointing device <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and microphone <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through a standard external device or system interface <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Interface <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> can be, for example, a serial port interface. Interface <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> can also be other types of external device or system interfaces such as a sound card, a modem, a network card, a parallel port, a game port or a universal serial bus (USB) for example. A monitor <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> or other type of display device is also connected to the system bus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> via an interface, such as a video card or adapter <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In addition to the monitor <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, computers may typically include other peripheral output devices such as speakers <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and printers. In embodiments of the invention, computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is coupleable through a serial, USB or other port to audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of a listening conditioning system for the purpose of uploading sound conditioning filter profiles to the audio conditioning unit. This will be described below in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may operate in a networked environment using logic connections to one or more remote computers such as a remote computer <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. The remote computer <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> may be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other network node. The logic connections depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> include a local area network (LAN) <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and a wide area network (WAN) <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer network intranets and the Internet, and any of these types of networks can be used to transfer data between computers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> as will be described below in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic illustration of a graphical user interface (GUI) <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of an application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the present invention. GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is displayed on computer monitor <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> in conjunction with the operating system GUI <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. For discussion purposes, inputs, outputs and other features described with reference to GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> should be understood to be discussions of inputs or outputs of application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the present invention. Further, other features of application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which are not specifically illustrated in GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are discussed as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is stored on a computer readable medium containing computer executable instructions for performing various steps in methods of the present invention for creating multiple filter profiles which can be uploaded to an audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of a sound or listening sound conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> runs on computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the user of the listening conditioning system can update or change the filter profiles without the aid of an audiologist as is typically required in the prior art. This is very useful in allowing the user of the listening conditioning system to compensate for temporary changes in hearing, for example caused by colds, allergies or other physical conditions. Also, application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> allows the user of the listening conditioning system to create new filter profiles for different sound environments to which the user may be exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a filter response plot display area <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, which is used to display a frequency response curve (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) corresponding to a filter profile generated by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for the user of the listening conditioning system. Also provided by GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are filter response manipulation inputs <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which are used to control or change the frequency response of a current filter profile which was loaded into or automatically generated by program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, filter response manipulation inputs <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> include multiple slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and corresponding direct gain numerical readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, each slide scale input <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and each corresponding direct gain numerical readout <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be used to manipulate the gain of a frequency range, of the filter profile, defined by the corner frequencies illustrated in corner frequency numerical inputs <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, only the slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> or only the readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be used to change the gain values, but not both. The corner frequency numerical inputs <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> for each frequency range are illustrated as being those inputs <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which are positioned immediately adjacent either side of the corresponding slide scale input <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and direct gain numerical readout <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Generally, the corner frequencies are set to the default values illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which conform to normal audiogram settings. However, the corner frequencies can be changed by the user if desired by entering different corner frequency values into inputs <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> using a pointing device and keyboard. Check box inputs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are selected to enable the various filter frequency ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also provided by GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are audiogram input controls <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Audiogram <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> input control <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be selected by a user of the personal computer, causing application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to conduct a standard audiogram test of the hearing of the user. Using speakers <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generate a series of tones at differing frequencies with linearly increasing volumes. When the volume of a tone increases to the point that the user can audibly detect the tone, the user provides an input to personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The input can be, for example, a press of a key on keyboard <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> At the end of the audiogram test, application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> automatically sets gain values for the different frequency ranges of the filter profile. This can be seen for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in which slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and direct gain numerical readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> reflect relative gain differences between the frequency ranges of the filter profile. The gain differences between the various frequency ranges in the filter profile are such that when filtering sound, the user of the listening conditioning system will hear sound in each of the frequency ranges at substantially equal volumes (assuming the sound of each frequency range is generated at a substantially equal volume) . In other words, the filter profile generated by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> attenuates the gain more in the frequency ranges in which the user&apos;s hearing is best such that when filtered the user will hear the filtered sound substantially equally well in all of the frequency ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Audiogram <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> causes application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to function similarly, but the sequence of tones provided by the personal computer and the speakers is not linearly increased in volume as was the case with the Audiogram <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. A binary search pattern sequency is used. In this manner, Audiogram <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> provides for a faster audiogram test of the user&apos;s hearing. Audiogram <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> can be selected by the user after the application of an the Audiogram <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or Audiogram <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> tests. Selection of the Audiogram <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> input <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> causes a series of tones to be filtered by the generated filter profile and played through the speakers. Thus a preliminary check of the filter profile generated using the Audiogram <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or Audiogram <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inputs can be conducted, allowing the user to verify that the volume of each tone sounds approximately equal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Also provided by GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are sound file manipulation inputs <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. When selected, Record Buffer A input control <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> causes application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to record sound data corresponding to audio to be played for the user of the sound conditioning system. The sound data can be representative of a variety of different sound environments to which the user of the listening conditioning system (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) will be exposed. The sound data recorded by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can be obtained from a variety of sources. For example, the sound data can be obtained by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> from microphone <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, from data stored on a magnetic or optical disc, from data at the sound card used to drive the speakers, from data downloaded over a computer network such as the Internet, or from other sources. The recorded sound data is temporarily stored in a memory location referred to as &ldquo;Buffer A&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Play Buf A input <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, when selected, causes application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to play the recorded and stored sound data over the speakers of the personal computer. Play Buf B input <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> causes the computer to play sound data stored in a second memory location known as &ldquo;Buffer B&rdquo; over the speakers. Buffer data transfer input control <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> causes sound data stored in the memory location referred to as Buffer A to be transferred to the memory location referred to as Buffer B. Input <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> causes sound data stored in memory location Buffer B to be transferred to the memory location Buffer A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Input <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, when selected, causes the sound data stored in memory location Buffer A to be filtered using the current filter profile (represented by the position of slide scales <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the numerical gain values shown in direct gain inputs <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>), with the filtered results stored in memory location Buffer B. Thus, sound data representing a particular sound environment can be recorded from an external source and stored in Buffer A, filtered using the filter profile generated by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and the filtered sound data stored in the memory location Buffer B. Then, using one or more of inputs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, the filtered sound data can be transferred between memory locations and/or ultimately played over the speakers of the personal computer. Thus, the user of the personal computer and of the listening conditioning system can test the generated filter profile on the recorded sound data to determine whether the filter profile is optimized for the particular sound environment and/or for current hearing loss levels. Maximum decibel input <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> sets the maximum volume of the sound data played back over the speakers of the personal computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also provided by GUI <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are file manipulation inputs <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>. Selecting input <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> causes a sound file having a name, which is input into alphanumeric input box <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, to be loaded into the memory location Buffer A from other more permanent memory locations. Selection of input <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> causes sound file data in memory location Buffer A to be stored in a sound file having a user determined name. Thus, using inputs <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, sound data recorded from other sources can be stored in memory of the personal computer and can be later retrieved for use in analysis of a generated filter profile. Generated profiles can be saved to memory of the computer using input <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> and alphanumeric input <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, while saved profiles can be loaded to application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> using input <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Thereby, multiple filter profiles corresponding to different sound environments and/or hearing conditions of the user can be saved in the memory of personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for uploading to the listening conditioning system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Sinewave control inputs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> respectively allow the duration, volume and frequency of a generated tone to be controlled by the user. The Sinewave or tone established by the user through manipulation of inputs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can be transferred to memory location Buffer A using transfer input <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, the tone can be filtered using the currently loaded or established filter profile (for example using input <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> discussed above) and played back to the user for analysis of the filter profile. The gain of individual frequency ranges of the filter profile can then be adjusted using tailored tones to facilitate feedback or testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow diagram <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> demonstrating a method in accordance with the present invention. Although described here as method steps, the invention also includes computer readable medium containing computer executable instructions for performing the steps of the method. As shown at block <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, the method includes the step of obtaining a first filter profile for an audio conditioning unit of a sound conditioning system, with the first filter profile corresponding to an audiogram of a user of the sound conditioning system. In some embodiments, step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of obtaining the first filter profile for the audio conditioning unit includes retrieving the first filter profile from memory of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this can be accomplished by selecting the load profile input <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the first filter profile can correspond to a filter profile established by an audiologist after conducting an audiogram test of the user&apos;s hearing, or can be a filter profile previously established by the user without the direct aid of an audiologist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring for the moment to the flow diagram <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of obtaining the first filter profile for an audio conditioning unit of a sound conditioning system can include the step shown at block <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight> of testing the hearing of the user of the sound conditioning system to establish an audiogram for the user, followed by the step shown at block <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> of determining the first filter profile from the audiogram. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can perform an audiogram-type test of the user&apos;s hearing. As discussed above, the audiogram-type test is initiated by selecting either of inputs <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Once the first filter profile for the user is obtained, gain values for the various frequency ranges of the filter profile are automatically set. This can be seen with the repositioning of slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> and the differing direct gain numerical values in readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Further, by selecting plot frequency response input <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> a frequency response <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is plotted in plot display area <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> as can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the method illustrated in flow diagram <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> next includes the step shown at block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of obtaining sound data corresponding to audio to be played for the user of the sound conditioning system. As discussed previously, the sound data corresponding to audio to be played for the user of the sound conditioning system can be obtained from a wide variety of sources. For example, the sound data can be retrieved from memory using input <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The sound data can also be retrieved from internal hardware of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, sound data can be retrieved from the sound card or sound driver of the computer. The sound data can also be retrieved from microphone <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or downloaded from a computer network such as the Internet. Generally, the sound data, and the corresponding audio to be played for the user of the sound conditioning system, represents a sound environment to which the user of the listening conditioning system will be exposed while using the conditioning system. For example, the audio can be various types of music, noise environments, sporting events, or any of a wide variety of other sound audio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The method of the invention shown in flow diagram <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also includes the step shown at block <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of filtering the sound data using the first filter profile to obtain first filtered sound data. Using application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, this can be performed for example by placing the sound data in Buffer A and selecting input <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> to filter the sound data in Buffer A, placing the filtered sound data in Buffer B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The method next includes the step shown at block <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of playing the first filtered sound data for the user of the sound conditioning system. Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this can be implemented by application program <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> upon the user selecting the appropriate input (for example inputs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>) to play the filtered sound data. When the filtered sound data is played by personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the user of the personal computer and the listening conditioning system can make a determination of whether the filtering afforded by the filter profile is appropriate for the particular sound environment and/or the user&apos;s current hearing capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes not only the ability to generate and/or test filter profiles on a variety of different types of audio, but also the ability for the user to adjust the filter profile to accommodate his or her specific needs, without requiring an audiologist&apos;s aid. using personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the user of the listening conditioning system can adjust filter profiles to compensate for changes in hearing resulting from a cold, for example. Similarly, the user of the listening conditioning system can utilize the personal computer to adjust filter profiles for his or her preferences in a variety of different sound environments. The various adjusted filter profiles can be saved in memory, and multiple different filter profiles can be uploaded to the listening conditioning system where the user selects which filter profile to use in a particular sound environment. These aspects of the present invention are further illustrated in the additional methods steps shown in the flow diagram <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in some embodiments the methods of the present invention further include the step shown at block <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> of receiving a change profile input from an input device controlled by the user of the sound conditioning system. As shown at block <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the application program changes the first filter profile in response to the change profile input. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, this input from the user can be, for example, in the form of clicking on and dragging one of slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to adjust the gain of a particular frequency range of the filter profile. Moving one of slide scale inputs <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> results in an automatic change of the gain value in the corresponding readout <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In the alternative, the user of personal computer can in some embodiments change the gain for a particular frequency range simply by clicking on one of readouts <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and using the keyboard to type in a new gain value. When all desired changes to the filter profile are completed, a second filter profile is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A next step in the method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> includes filtering the sound data using the second filter profile to obtain second filtered sound data. This step is shown at block <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight> and can be implemented, for example, using input <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Next, as shown at block <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>, the method includes playing the second filtered sound data for the user of the sound conditioning system. This step can be implemented, for example, using the play buffer inputs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Playing the second filtered sound data for the user of the conditioning system allows the user to determine whether the second filter profile is an improvement over the first filter profile for a particular sound environment and/or for the user&apos;s current hearing capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> illustrate further steps in embodiments of the methods of the present invention. As illustrated in the flow diagram <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, if the user of the listening conditioning system determines that the second filter profile is an improvement for a particular sound environment or for the current hearing capabilities of the user, he or she provides a save profile input to the application program. For example, using the keyboard or a pointing device, a name for the second filter profile can be entered in file name input <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight>, and save profile input <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> can be selected to cause the second filter profile to be saved to the memory of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These steps are shown in blocks <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Once one or more (typically multiple) filter profiles are saved in the memory of computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the user of the personal computer provides an input command to upload the filter profile(s) to an audio conditioning unit of the user&apos;s listening conditioning system. Upon the application program receiving the upload filter profile input from the input device (block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> shown in flow diagram <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), the second filter profile is uploaded to the audio conditioning unit in response (block <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>). In this manner, the audio conditioning unit of the user&apos;s listening conditioning system can be updated in the convenience of the user&apos;s home. Neither a trip to an audiologist, nor the burden and task of returning the listening conditioning system to the manufacturer, are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating embodiments of listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the present invention. As shown, listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes multiple effective displacement compression units (EDUs) <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>M, audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and multiple audio delivery components <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>N. Each EDU <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is positionable proximate a sound source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> (sound sources <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>L are shown), and can include an attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> which attaches the EDU to the desired sound source. In some embodiments, the attachment mechanism <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is a lapel attachment mechanism which is adapted to attach the EDU to the clothing of a speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring for the moment to the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, shown is a more particular embodiment of an EDU <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> the present invention. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, each EDU <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> includes a microphone or sound sensing component <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> which coverts sound from the proximate source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> into electrical signals <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>. Each EDU <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> also includes a transmitter <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, coupled to the sound sensing component <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, which receives the electrical signals and in response transmits electromagnetic signals <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> (signals <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>M are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) indicative of sound from the proximate source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> sensed by the sound sensing component. By including multiple EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> in system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, multi-channeled wireless raw sound delivery to audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Each channel <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> can correspond to an EDU proximate a different source of sound. However, in some embodiments, multiple EDUs are positioned proximate the same source of sound in order to capture the sound from that source in a stereo format. For example, EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>D are each positioned proximate source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>C. Electromagnetic signals or channels <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>D can thereby provide stereo sound from source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>C. The electromagnetic signals transmitted by EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> can be wireless format signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> also includes audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> in greater detail. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a receiver <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> which receives the electromagnetic signals or channels EDU-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through EDU-M (<highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>N) transmitted by the EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Receiver <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> converts the electromagnetic signals into digital sound data channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> (channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>N are shown) . It will be understood by those of skill in the signal processing art that the number of channels M provided to receiver <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> need not be the same as the number of output channels N provided by the receiver. Although several stages of signal processing illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> are shown to include N channels, it is to be understood that the number of channels provided to any stage of the signal processing circuitry need not be the same as the number of channels provided as an output from that stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As is also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> further includes digital signal processing circuitry <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> coupled to the multiple receiver output channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. The digital signal processing circuitry <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> filters the digital sound data from each receiver output channel <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> using a filter profile to obtain filtered digital sound data or data channels <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>N. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A profile upload input <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> is included in audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and is configured to be coupled to personal computer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Profile upload input <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> receives one or more (typically multiple) available filter profiles from the personal computer for use in different sound environments. As such, each of the multiple available filter profiles uploaded to audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> through input <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> corresponds to user preferences or to an audiogram of a user of the listening conditioning system and to a particular sound environment. A profile selection user input <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> is also included in audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The user input <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> provides a mechanism for the user of the listening conditioning system to select one of the filter profiles from the multiple available filter profiles. Thus, the user can change the filter profile used to filter sound data based upon the current sound environment to which he or she is exposed. In some embodiments, different filter profiles can be selected to filter different sound data channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> containing sound data from sources in differing sound environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A transmitter <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> of audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is coupled to digital signal processing circuitry <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> and is configured to transmit filtered sound data from each of the plurality of receiver channels. Like EDUs <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, transmitter <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> is adapted for wireless transmission of output channels ACUL-ACUN (<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>N). In the particular embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. transmitter <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> transmits filtered sound data from each of the plurality of receiver channels by transmitting filtered digital sound data <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. Sound data <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> can be transmitted in any of a wide range of formats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> also includes at least one audio delivery component (ADC) <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes N ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>N. However, this need not be the case. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, each ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> includes a receiver <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> and a speaker component <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. The receiver receives the filtered sound data <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> from multiple of the ACU output channels <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>N, providing ADC receiver output channel data <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> in response. Speaker component <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> converts the received and filtered sound data <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> into sound for a user <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> (users <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>B are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the listening conditioning system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the present invention, a left audio delivery component and a right audio delivery component are respectively positionable proximate the left and right ears of a user of the listening conditioning system. For example, ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>A and ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>B can be left and right ADCs positionable proximate left and right ears of user <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>A. In these embodiments, audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be configured to transmit a first portion of the filtered sound data, corresponding to a first portion of the plurality of receiver channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> or output channels <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, to the left conditioning unit, while it transmits a second portion of the filtered sound data corresponding to a second portion of the multiple receiver or output channels to the right ADC. Thereby, stereo or directional sound delivery is provided to the user of the listening conditioning system. In some embodiments, the audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is configured such that sound data corresponding to different ones of the multiple receiver channels <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> (or corresponding output channels <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>) is filtered by the digital signal processor <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> using different ones of the plurality of available filter profiles. Therefore, if different sources of sound <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> are positioned in or represent different sound environments, different filter profiles can be used to filter sound data from these different sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can include a universal audio connection with delivery to standard output jacks so that the media used is user optional for different sound environments. A variety of different embodiments of ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can be utilized in the present invention. For example, at least one of ADCs <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can include a telephone or cell phone adapted to receive filtered sound data from audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, at least one ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> includes a stereo receiver adapted to receive filtered sound data from audio conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and to play the sound data over speakers connected to the stereo receiver. In yet other embodiments, at least one ADC <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is a hearing aid device coupleable to the ear of the user. Other embodiments include over ear head phones, in ear head phones, or other sound delivering devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the system disclosed, by the placement of the sound sensing component and electromagnetic propagation (as opposed to wave propagation of the sound), the effective displacement between sound source and sound receiver is compressed. For example when capture is <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&Prime; from the sound source rather than <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&prime;(<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>&times;) the sound level is improved by 64 times(36 db). This is audio quality that the conditioning unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> need not supply. Furthermore, ambient signal-to-noise is improved by the same factor. Typical sound environments include dining in a restaurant and riding in a car, each of which present significant noise problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring to the environments above, in an example use of system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, each of multiple speakers (sound sources <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>) is fitted with a wireless lapel microphone, each with a corresponding receiver channel in the conditioning unit. Directional orientation can be preserved by (color) coding the microphones. The audio conditioning unit delivers the captured sound to the left, balanced, or right ears of the user depending on the relative directions of the speaker(s) as set up by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to optical lenses and, more particularly, to liquid crystal switchable lenses with electrically adjustable focal lengths, and related fabrication and control methods. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In many applications, such as imaging systems, display systems, optical memory systems and optical communication systems, it is desirable for the focal length of the lens system to be adjustable. In conventional lens systems, the lenses are designed to focus light by varying the thickness of a uniform refractive index medium over an aperture. The phase delay is generally graded in a parabolic shape across the aperture. Currently, adjustment of such conventional lenses are made in most systems by mechanical movement, with the lenses having static indices of refraction. This mechanical movement, however, is usually bulky, slow and expensive. Additionally, in high-power microscope systems the working distance is very short, which makes it easy to damage expensive lenses and samples being viewed when trying to mechanically adjust the focal length of the lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To remedy the problems associated with mechanically adjustable optics, liquid crystal (LC) switchable lenses with electrically adjustable focal lengths have been developed to provide adaptive optics, which directs light in real time without mechanical motion of bulky optics. For example, LC switchable lenses, such as micro-lenses, LC active lenses and LC modal lenses, are electro-optical devices that utilize a refractive index graded over the aperture of the lens to bring light into focus. In this regard, micro-lenses use a pair of hole-patterned electrodes to grade the refractive index over the aperture. LC active lenses connect a lens with a two-dimensional liquid crystal phase modulator with an electrode matrix. And LC modal lenses are driven by an AC voltage applied to the cell boundary. Generally, LC lenses have several advantages over mechanically adjustable optics, such as light weight, fast speed, simple control, low power consumption, high reliability, low cost and the ability to simulate different lens configurations, such as spherical and cylindrical lenses as well as Fresnel lenses, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One type of LC switchable lens uses two tandem cells with orthogonal linear electrodes to control the refractive index of the lens. In these lenses, the surface of the lens is treated so that the liquid crystal molecules align homogeneously in either the &ldquo;x&rdquo; or &ldquo;y&rdquo; direction. If the preferred direction is in the &ldquo;x&rdquo; direction, only light polarized in the &ldquo;x&rdquo; direction will be affected, and visa versa. A single lens of this type of configuration, however, can only emulate a cylindrical lens. And due to the polarization sensitivity of the lens, to obtain a true spherical lens that can focus random plane polarized light, four cells of this configuration are required instead of two. Thus, to simulate spherical lenses, these type of LC lenses require two cells for each linear polarization. Additionally, because cells are never identical, two cells cannot be driven with the same voltages, which further complicates the operation of these lenses. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In light of the foregoing background, the present invention provides a liquid crystal adaptive lens (LCAL) with closed-loop electrodes and related fabrication methods and control methods. The closed-loop shape of the electrodes enables the electrodes to provide radial variation in the refractive index of the LCAL. Thus, the LCAL is capable of focusing linearly polarized light with just one cell. Additionally, because one cell can focus linearly polarized light, a single controller can drive the cell with one set of control voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the present invention, a liquid crystal adaptive lens (LCAL) comprises a reference plate, a liquid crystal layer disposed in electrical communication with the reference plate, and a plurality of closed-loop electrodes disposed in electrical communication with the liquid crystal layer. The closed-loop electrodes are adapted to receive a variable control voltage such that the refractive index of at least a portion of the liquid crystal layer is adjustable such that light passing through the liquid crystal layer is capable of having its phase modulated across the aperture of the liquid crystal layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To provide radial variation in the refractive index across at least a portion of the liquid crystal layer the closed-loop electrodes can be disposed in a concentric circular pattern. And to provide the variable control voltage to the closed-loop electrodes, the LCAL can further include at least one pair of conductors in electrical contact with at least two closed-loop electrodes, and at least one connector electrically connecting at least two closed-loop electrodes and each conductor of a respective pair of conductors. The closed-loop electrodes can also be evenly spaced from one another such that a voltage drop between each adjacent closed-loop electrode is equal when the variable control voltage is applied across the pairs of conductors. Additionally, the pairs of conductors can have a resistivity less than a resistivity of a respective connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the closed-loop electrodes comprise at least one subset of closed-loop electrodes. In this embodiment, each pair of conductors are in electrical contact with a respective subset of closed-loop electrodes, and each connector electrically connects each closed-loop electrode of a respective subset of closed-loop electrodes and each conductor of the respective pair of conductors. As such, the LCAL can emulate a Fresnel phase profile with each subset of closed-loop electrodes comprising a Fresnel zone. In this regard, to reduce overall aberration, a phase delay in each Fresnel zone can be equal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of fabricating a liquid crystal adaptive lens comprises begins by forming the pairs of conductors upon a substrate, and thereafter depositing an insulating layer upon the pairs of conductors and the substrate. Next, the closed-loop electrodes are created on the insulating layer such that at least one closed-loop electrode is in electrical contact with each conductor. For example, the closed-loop electrodes can be created by depositing a layer of electrically conductive material upon the insulating layer and thereafter forming the layer of electrically conductive material into the plurality of closed-loop electrodes. In a further embodiment, creating the closed-loop electrodes can include forming at least one connector between at least two closed-loop electrodes. After the closed-loop electrodes are created, a layer of liquid crystal is then deposited upon the plurality of closed-loop electrodes, and the reference plate is secured upon the layer of liquid crystal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the closed-loop electrodes are created by forming at least one pair of electrically conductive vias within the insulating layer such that the vias are in electrical contact with a respective pair of conductors. And then the closed-loop electrodes are produced such that at least one closed-loop electrode electrically contacts each via. In this regard, the electrically conductive vias can be formed by first forming an etch mask defining at least one opening upon the insulating layer. Then, at least one hole is etched within the openings, with the holes extending through the insulating layer such that at least a portion of the at least one pair of conductors is exposed. Finally, an electrically conductive material is deposited within the holes such that the electrically conductive material electrically contacts the pairs of conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides an LCAL system that comprises an LCAL, such as that described above, and an auto-focusing subsystem capable of adjusting the variable control voltage to the LCAL to thereby adjust a refractive index of at least a portion of the liquid crystal layer of the LCAL such that light passing through the liquid crystal layer is capable of being redirected. In this regard, the auto-focusing subsystem can include an image source capable of passing light through the LCAL, and an image capture device capable of capturing the light after the light passes through the liquid crystal layer of the LCAL. Further, the auto-focusing subsystem can include a control element capable of adjusting the variable control voltage to at least one subset of the closed-loop electrodes of the LCAL to thereby adjust the refractive index of at least a portion of the liquid crystal layer of the LCAL. In this regard, the control element is capable of adjusting the variable control voltage at least partially based upon a point spread function of the light captured by the image capture device. For example, the control element can apply the variable control voltage to the conductors of the LCAL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the control element is capable of applying a set of control voltages to the LCAL and thereafter calculating the point spread function for the light captured by the image capture device at each control voltage. In this embodiment, the control element is capable of adjusting the variable control voltage based on a comparison of the point spread function for the light captured at each control voltage in the set. In embodiments where the closed-loop electrodes comprise at least one subset of closed-loop electrodes, the control element is capable of applying a set of control voltages to each subset of closed-loop electrodes, and thereafter calculating the point spread function for the light captured by the image capture device at each voltage within each set of voltages applied to each subset of closed-loop electrodes. As such, the control element can compare the point spread function for the light captured at each voltage, and adjust the variable control voltage to the closed-loop electrodes based upon the comparison of the point spread function for the light captured at each control voltage of each set of voltages applied to each subset of closed-loop electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the LCAL system further includes a lens capable of directing the light in a predetermined direction before the light passes through the LCAL. Also, the LCAL system can include a polarizer capable of polarizing the light in a predefined orientation after the lens directs the light and before the light passes through the LCAL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In operation, a variable control voltage is applied to a subset of the closed-loop electrodes of the LCAL. Light is then passed through the liquid crystal layer of the LCAL and thereafter captured. A point spread function for the light captured is calculated, and the variable control voltage is adjusted at least partially based upon the point spread function to thereby adjust a refractive index of at least a portion of the liquid crystal layer such that the light passing through the liquid crystal layer is redirected. In embodiments including the lens and polarizer, the light is directed in a predetermined direction before passing the light through the LCAL. Then, the light is polarized in a predefined orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a series of control voltages are applied to the subset of the closed-loop electrodes. As such, the light is captured after passing through the LCAL at each control voltage, and the point spread function is calculated for the light captured at each control voltage. In this embodiment, the point spread functions for the light captured at each control voltage are compared before adjusting the variable control voltage, with the variable control voltage adjusted based upon the comparison. Further, in one embodiment, the light is passed and captured, and the point spread functions are calculated and compared repeatedly for each subset of the plurality of closed-loop electrodes before adjusting the variable control voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the LCAL with closed-loop electrodes of the present invention can produce radial variation in the refractive index of the liquid crystal layer of the LCAL. Thus, the LCAL is capable of focusing linearly polarized light with just one cell, with a single controller driving the cell with one set of control voltages for each focal length desired.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B, the liquid crystal (LC) adaptive lens (LCAL) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is a multi-layer composite device supported by a substrate layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such as a glass substrate. The LCAL includes a reference plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a nematic liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> deposited in electrical communication with the reference plate, and a plurality of closed-loop electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> deposited in electrical communication with the liquid crystal layer. The closed-loop electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are constructed of a conducting material, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass. The electrodes can have any of a number of closed-loop shapes but, in a preferred embodiment, the electrodes are circular shaped and disposed in a concentric pattern. While the size of each electrode and separation between electrodes can vary, in one embodiment the electrodes are 10 micrometers wide, and 10 micrometers apart on a 20 micrometer center. Each electrode on the electrode plate is adapted to receive a variable control voltage such that the refractive index across the aperture of the liquid crystal layer and, thus, the LCAL, can be graded such that light passing through the LCAL is capable of being redirected, such as by being brought into focus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As stated above, an LC switchable lens utilizing two tandem cells with orthogonal linear electrodes has disadvantages in that more cells are required to simulate a true spherical lens, and that having more cells complicates the operation of the lens because two cells cannot be driven with the same voltages. The LCAL of the present invention remedies this problem by providing a number of closed-loop electrodes, preferably arranged in a circular concentric pattern. By having electrodes in a closed-loop shape, particularly a circular shape, the electrodes can provide radial variation in the refractive index of the LCAL. Thus, the LCAL will be able to focus linearly polarized light with just one cell driven by a single controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In order to apply a voltage across the electrodes, the LCAL <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a set of highly conductive conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, connected to respective closed-loop electrodes and electrically interconnected by highly conductive connectors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The connectors not only connect the conductors, but also are generally connected to one or more additional closed-loop electrodes that are disposed between the closed-loop electrodes to which the conductors are connected. While the conductors and connectors can vary in width depending upon the application, in one embodiment the conducting and connectors have a width of 10 micrometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Because of the conductivity of the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and connectors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, they must be separated in the LCAL by an insulating layer, including a base insulating layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a planarizing insulating layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in one embodiment. Although the insulating layers are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> so that the relative position of the conductors to the closed-loop electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and connectors can be highlighted, it should be understood that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is for illustrative purposes only and should not be seen as an actual representation of the LCAL. While the insulating layers can be formed from a variety of different insulating materials, in one embodiment the insulating layers are formed of SU-8. In order improve the performance of the LCAL, the molecules of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> should not be affected by the electromagnetic field of the conductors. Therefore, while the insulating layers can have any of a number of thicknesses, the thickness should be selected as large as possible while taking into account the desired performance of the LCAL and the fabrication process, since larger thicknesses are generally more difficult to fabricate. To electrically interconnect the conductors with the connectors, the LCAL includes electrical vias <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or other electrical connections within the insulating layer between respective conductors and connectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As known to those skilled in the art, many conventional lenses suffer from phase aberration, which results in blurring and loss of clearness in the images produced by the lenses. There are generally two sets of phase aberrations, static phase aberration and dynamic phase aberration. Dynamic phase aberration results from inaccurate applied voltages that can be adjusted during operation. Generally, static phase aberration can be characterized as either quantization aberration and meshing aberration. In this regard, quantization aberration is the result of sampling the refractive index of the lens by discrete electrodes, while meshing aberration results from the difference in refractive indices between the electrode region and the interstitial region (region between electrodes). The refractive index distortion in the interstitial region creates the meshing phase aberration, which causes a &ldquo;lenslet&rdquo; effect. And when Fresnel lenses are simulated with conventional LC switchable lenses, the lenslet effect generally causes discontinuity at the boundary of each Fresnel zone, thus introducing aberration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> To reduce static phase aberration in the LCAL <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, closed-loop electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and connectors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> form a &ldquo;conductive ladder meshing&rdquo; design. The conductive ladder meshing design divides the LCAL into sections such that each section includes a subset of electrodes, including a plurality of closed-loop electrodes, two addressable conductors connected to two of the closed-loop electrodes (typically the two outermost closed-loop electrodes of the subset) and a connector extending between the two conductors and connected to each of the other closed-loop electrodes, i.e., any intermediate closed-loop electrodes of the subset. Upon applying a variable control voltage across the two conductors, the voltage drop along the connector will be linear, and the voltage drop between each pair of adjacent closed-loop electrodes will be equal since the closed-loop electrodes are evenly spaced. The voltage drop between the closed-loop electrodes will be produced and controlled by a voltage drop along the connector. In this regard, the voltage drop along the conductor is preferably small enough so that the applied voltage can be in the desired operation range. The voltage drop can be controlled by the ratio of the resistivity of the conductor and the resistivity of the connector. In order to decrease the voltage drop, the resistivity of the conductors is preferably low (such as 5 &OHgr;-square) compared to the resistivity of the connectors (such as 500 &OHgr;-square), preferably at a ratio of less than 0.4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The conductive ladder meshing design gives the LCAL a property known as &ldquo;sloppy staircase&rdquo; phase delay between the two addressable conductors. The conductive ladder meshing design also allows a Fresnel phase profile to be emulated with the LCAL <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with each section made up of a subset of closed-loop electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> electrically connected by a connector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to act as a Fresnel zone, with two Fresnel zones shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> only depict Fresnel zones comprising two and three closed-loop electrodes and two conductors, it should be understood that the Fresnel zones typically comprise a greater number of electrodes and conductors, and the figures are for illustrative purposes only. As stated, the number of electrodes in the LCAL and the number of electrodes in each Fresnel zone can vary. For example, in one embodiment, the LCAL includes 196 closed-loop electrodes divided into 32 Fresnel zones, with 32 connectors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (one per Fresnel zone) and 64 conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (two addressable conductors per Fresnel zone). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> To reduce the overall aberration, the LCAL <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> employs an equal phase spacing design wherein the phase delay in each Fresnel zone is equal. For a nominal &ldquo;design&rdquo; focal length, the phase delay in each Fresnel zone is 2&pgr;. For example, at any given time, an AC voltage at a conductor connected at one end of a respective connector will have a phase that differs by 2&pgr; from the AC voltage at the conductor connected at the other end of the respective connector. When the focal length is changed, the phase delay in each Fresnel zone will be equal, but not exactly 2&pgr;. The equal phase spacing design minimizes overall aberration, optimizes the coherent transfer function (CTF), and maximizes the variable focal length range. While the focal length varies, the nominal designed focal length for one advantageous LCAL is 0.38 meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> For the steady-state, assuming that the refractive index under the closed-loop electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is uniform while in the interstitial region (region between closed-loop electrodes), the refractive index is parabolic in shape because of electrostatic field meshing. Because of the closed-loop geometry of the electrodes, the LCAL <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be considered as an ideal thin lens with aberration. Ignoring the constant phase term, the transmittance of the LCAL for a given radius of the aperture of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, r, is:

As previously stated with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>J only depict a single Fresnel zone comprising two closed-loop electrodes and two conductors. It should be understood, however, that the Fresnel zones typically comprise a greater number of electrodes and conductors, and the figures are for illustrative purposes only. Next, an insulating layer is deposited on the substrate layer over the conductors. While the insulating layer may be constructed in different manners, the insulating layer of the illustrated embodiment includes a base insulating layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a planarizing insulating layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the base insulating layer is deposited on the substrate layer over the conductors, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>. It will be understood by those having skill in the art that a layer, element or component that is described as being &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;deposited upon&rdquo; another layer, element or component may be either deposited directly on the underlying element or may merely overlie the other element with one or more intervening layers or elements being disposed between the elements. The base insulating layer, along with the planarizing insulating layer, formed later, will act to insulate the conductors from the connectors at all locations, except at the vias <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Typically, the base insulating layer is formed of SU-8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> After the base insulating layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is deposited, the closed-loop electrodes are created on the insulating layer. In the illustrated embodiment, at least one closed-loop electrode is in electrical contact with each conductor. However, the LCAL may include more closed-loop electrodes than conductors, if desired. The closed-loop electrodes and the conductors may be electrically connected in various manners. In one preferred embodiment, vias <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are formed in the base insulating layer by first spinning photoresist <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the base insulating layer and then patterning, developing and rinsing the photoresist so the remaining photoresist only covers the locations on the base insulating layer overlying and aligned with the conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> where the vias will be located. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>. A layer of material highly resistant to etching, such as chromium <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, is then sputtered on the base insulating layer around the photoresist, and the photoresist is removed, such as by a lift-off process, to expose the base insulating layer, thus forming an etch mask at the locations where the vias will be located. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</cross-reference>. Next, holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are etched through the base insulating layer at the exposed locations such that at least a portion of the conductors is exposed. The chromium mask is then removed. While the holes can be etched using any number of methods known to those skilled in the art, in one embodiment the holes are etched using a reactive ion etcher. Also, because the holes will be used to form electrically conductive vias, the holes will typically have sloped edges, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</cross-reference>. Next, the vias are formed by depositing an electrically conductive material, such as ITO, along the edges and side walls of the holes so that the conductors can be electrically connected to the electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and connectors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, both formed later. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Following the formation of the vias <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a planarizing insulating layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is preferably formed on the base insulating layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and etched back to expose the conductive material on the edges of the holes <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</cross-reference>. Next, the electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are created on the planarizing insulating layer. First, an electrically conductive material, such as ITO-coated glass, is deposited on the planarizing insulating layer, such as by sputtering. Then, the electrically conductive material is formed, such as by a lift-off process, into several closed-loop shapes such that each closed-loop shape comprises one closed-loop electrode, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>. Additionally, the electrically conductive material is preferably shaped to form the connectors <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between the electrodes at the location of the vias, so that each conductor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to a respective closed-loop electrode and to the connector by means of a via. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>J, after the electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are created, an alignment layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is deposited on the planarizing insulating layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a layer of nematic liquid crystal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is deposited on the alignment layer. Whereas the alignment layer can comprise any of a number of different materials, in one embodiment the alignment layer comprises a polyimide film brushed to set the alignment direction. The thickness of the liquid crystal layer can vary depending upon the desired application. After the liquid crystal layer is deposited on the alignment layer, the reference plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is deposited to the liquid crystal layer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In operation, a voltage difference is applied across each pair of interconnected conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, thereby adjusting the refractive index of the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> based upon the voltage potential of each closed-loop electrode. In addition, a reference voltage, such as ground, is applied to the reference plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> while a voltage differential is applied across each pair of interconnected conductors. Manually driving the LCAL <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by adjusting it zone by zone generally requires a relatively long time, may not be very accurate and may not be suitable for all real-time application. Therefore, because the liquid crystal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reacts to the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the input pulse to the electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, one aspect of the present invention provides an auto-focusing subsystem to provide an adjustable RMS value of an input pulse to the addressable conductors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, for one Fresnel zone, a set of voltages is input to the two addressable conductors. See block <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Light, such as an image, is then passed through the LCAL, and thereafter captured at a predefined distance from the LCAL. The image is then analyzed to find the point spread function of the image, as shown in block <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Because the LCAL is not a perfect optical lens at every voltage input, the image will undergo a certain degree of degradation after passing through the LCAL at the image&apos;s capture point, resulting in an image that is somewhat different than the original image. As known to those skilled in the art, the point spread function (PSF) for the LCAL at each voltage will represent the light distribution of a point after passing through the LCAL, with the intensity of the light varying as the image varies around its desired location (with desired focal length of the LCAL). The optimum focal length can be determined by comparing the PSF distributions at the predefined distance from the LCAL for various input voltages to determine the input voltage associated with the image having an intensity that varies the least as the image varies around its desired location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Next, for each addressable electrode, the voltage is increased through a set of voltages from a start voltage to an end voltage, and the PSF for the image at each voltage is captured. See blocks <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The PSFs are compared to find the optimal PSF for the image which, in turn, corresponds to the desired focal voltage setting for the Fresnel zone, as shown in block <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the optimal PSF can be characterized as the PSF associated with the image having an intensity that varies the least as the image varies around its desired location. The next Fresnel zone is then selected, and the process is repeated. See blocks <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. When the desired focal voltage setting is determined for all Fresnel zones, the desired focal voltage is output to all respective Fresnel zones, and the final image and PSF are recorded, as shown in blocks <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an example configuration of the auto-focusing subsystem <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The auto-focusing system consists of a laser <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, such as a He-Ne laser, that provides the input light, or image, to the system. The input image travels through collimating lens <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that redirects the image on its route to a mirror <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which directs the image to the LCAL <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, after the image travels through a polarizer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which polarizes the light in a predefined direction. Additionally, the input image can travel through a spatial filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> before traveling through the collimating lens. The image then passes through the LCAL and is captured by an image capture device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, such as a charge injection device (CID) camera, which is set a predefined distance from the LCAL. As the image passes through the LCAL, the controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of a control element <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> provides the input voltage to the addressable electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which control the focal length of the LCAL for a respective Fresnel zone. The processing element <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the control element then records the input voltage from the controller and calculates the PSF of the image captured by the image capture device. After the PSF is calculated for each voltage in the range of input voltages, the processing element compares the PSF for each voltage. In this regard, the processing element can determine the voltage corresponding with the PSF exhibiting the least amount of spread of light and, thus, the least amount of intensity variation in the image captured. And based upon the comparison of the PSF for each voltage, the processing element determines and records the desired focal voltage for that particular Fresnel zone. Once the processing element has determined the desired focal voltage for each Fresnel zone, the processing element instructs the controller accordingly to produce the final, optimized image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates an example arrangement for the controller <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The controller is designed to be able to generate an AC signal with adjustable RMS value and zero DC offset using a set of digital-to-analog (D/A) converters. The controller is preferably designed for accurate outputs, fast speed and appropriate frequency. The controller includes a microcontroller <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, such as a MC68336 microcontroller, which operates with an oscillator <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, such as a 14.7456 MHz crystal oscillator. The microcontoller receives commands from the computer, typically through a serial interface and level translator <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which alters the voltage level between the computer and microcontroller. The controller also includes a set of memory devices, such as EPROM <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, flash memory <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and SRAM <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> for storage of electrode addresses and other data used in the controller. The controller includes address decoders <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for addressing the addressable electrodes. To send signals to the addressable electrodes, the controller includes a set of data buffers <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which send the signals to the electrodes through a group of D/A converters <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment including 64 conductors, the controller includes 64 D/A converters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As such, by including closed-loop electrodes, the LCAL of the present invention can include radial variation in the refractive index of the liquid crystal layer of the LCAL. And due to the radial variation in the refractive index, the LCAL is capable of focusing linearly polarized light with just one cell, with a single controller driving the cell with one control voltage, as opposed to conventional lenses, which require multiple cells driven with multiple voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The generation of non-classical states of light is of fundamental scientific and technological interest. For example, &ldquo;squeezed states&rdquo; enable measurements to be performed at lower noise levels than possible using classical light. Deterministic (or triggered) single-photon sources exhibit non-classical behavior in that they emit, with a high degree of certainty, just one photon at a user-specified time. In contrast, a classical source such as an attenuated pulsed laser emits photons according to Poisson statistics. A deterministic source of single photons could find applications in quantum information processing, quantum cryptography and certain quantum computation problems. The importance and utility of quantum information has been discussed in several review articles, see for example the special issue of <highlight><italic>Special Issue on quantum information, Phys. World </italic></highlight>11(3) 1998 and Bennett C. H. et al. (1992) in a paper entitled <highlight><italic>Quantum Cryptography </italic></highlight>and published in <highlight><italic>Sci. Am. </italic></highlight>267(4):50-57. A key attack, known as the beamsplitter attack, has also been described by Buttler, W. T. et al. (1998) in a paper entitled &ldquo;<highlight><italic>Practical Free</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Space Quantum key Distribution over </italic></highlight>1 <highlight><italic>km</italic></highlight>&rdquo;, and published in <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. Lett. </italic></highlight>81:3283-3286. Importantly, this attack can be avoided by using a single photon per pulse to transmit the cryptographic information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various schemes have been proposed to create a single-photon source, for example, involving single atoms in cavities (See e.g. Parkins A. S. et al. (1995) in a paper entitled <highlight><italic>Quantum</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>state mapping between multilevel atoms and cavity light fields </italic></highlight>and published in <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. A </italic></highlight>51:1578-1596<highlight><italic>; Cirac J. L. </italic></highlight>et al. (1997) in a paper entitled <highlight><italic>Quantum state transfer and entanglement distribution among distant nodes in a quantum network </italic></highlight>and published in <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. Lett. </italic></highlight>78:32210-3224; Kuhn A. et al. (1999) in a paper entitled <highlight><italic>Controlled generation of single photons from a strongly coupled atom-cavity system </italic></highlight>and published in <highlight><italic>Appl. Phys. B </italic></highlight>69:373-377), or highly nonlinear cavities (See e.g. <highlight><italic>Imamoglu A. </italic></highlight>et al. (1997) in a paper entitled <highlight><italic>Strongly interacting photons on a nonlinear cavity </italic></highlight>and published in <highlight><italic>Phys Rev. Lett. </italic></highlight>79:1467-1470). Such single-photon sources have, for example, only been demonstrated in some experiments at cryogenic temperatures. One method involves using a &ldquo;turnstile&rdquo; effect based on a Coulomb blockade for electrons and holes in a mesoscopic double barrier p-n junction (See e.g. Kim J et al. (1999) in a paper entitled <highlight><italic>A single</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>photon turnstile device </italic></highlight>and published in Nature 397: 500-503). A dilution refrigerator operating at 50 mK was crucial for minimizing the thermal energy background. Due to the sample geometry, the detection efficiency was limited to about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4</superscript></highlight>, which made it difficult to measure the second-order intensity correlation of the emitted photons, an important diagnostic of the non-classical nature of the light. Another cryogenic method involves controlled excitation of a single molecule in a solid, in which a rapid adiabatic passage method is used to prepare the molecule in its fluorescent state (See e.g. Brunel, C. et al. (1999) in a paper entitled <highlight><italic>Triggered source of single photons based on controlled single molecule fluorescence </italic></highlight>and published in <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. Lett. </italic></highlight>83:2722-2725). Very narrow optical absorption lines are needed for this method, which require liquid helium temperatures (2K). The detection efficiency was limited to about 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3</superscript></highlight>. Yet another method involves a quantum dot single photon turnstile device that generates a train of single-photon pulses (See Michler P. et al. (2000) in a paper entitled <highlight><italic>A quantum dot single</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>photon turnstile device </italic></highlight>and published in <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>290:2282-2285). Controlled release of single-photons from their quantum dot device also requires cryogenic conditions (4K). Cryogenic temperatures are often difficult to produce, requiring a cryostat, a cryogen or refrigerator, and the associated equipment to monitor and control the sample temperature. These additional items add expense to the overall system. Accordingly, there is a need to develop new approaches to create single-photon sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Reports of photon antibunching for single molecules under continuous-wave excitation have appeared in the literature (See e.g. Fleury, L. et al. (2000) in a paper entitled <highlight><italic>Nonclassical photon statistics in single</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>molecule fluorescence at room temperature </italic></highlight>and published in <highlight><italic>Phys. Rev. Lett. </italic></highlight>84:1148-1151). While the emitted photons cannot be emitted two at a time, the overall emission time of photons under continuous-wave excitation is random and is not useful for transmission of bits by quantum cryptography techniques. The observation of photon antibunching is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a controllable source of single photons. Accordingly, there is also a need for controlled emission of single photons. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for the generation of a controllable source of single photons generated one at a time using optical pumping of a single molecule in a host at room temperature.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Although the following detailed description contains many specifics for the purposes of illustration, anyone of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following exemplary details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the following preferred embodiment of the invention is set forth without any loss of generality to, and without imposing limitations upon, the claimed invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an optical device and method that provides a high performance, room temperature source of single-photons upon demand that would be a key component in an optical quantum cryptography and information/communication system. The present invention uses single photons, one at a time, to encode information in entangled polarization states to achieve the highest level of reliability. Triggered single photons are produced at a high rate, whereas the probability of simultaneous emission of two photons is nearly zero. This is a very useful property for secure quantum cryptography. The present invention is characterized by a room-temperature operation and improved performance compared to other triggered sources of single photons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention realizes a controllable source of single photons using optical pumping of a single molecule in a host. The present invention provides a device and method wherein a single molecule embedded in a host at ambient temperatures is pumped by a light pulse (e.g. a short laser pulse of sufficient energy) to place the single molecule in the excited emitting state with high probability. The single molecule then emits one and only one fluorescent photon for each pump pulse. A pumping pulse that also would place the molecule in the excited state with high probability would be a pulse of pulse area equal to &pgr;. Maximizing the probability of emission of a single photon is done by utilizing a pumped laser whose pulse width is much less than the excited state lifetime of a single molecule and by pumping into the vibronic sideband of the optical absorption. For sufficient pump pulse energy, the molecule can be placed into the highly emissive excited state with high probability. This approach is easier to implement than other pumping schemes such as adiabatic passage or the use of an inverting resonant laser pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In general, the present invention is described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> as a host <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that hosts a single molecule <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a light source <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to supply a pump light pulse <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to host <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to excite single molecule <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to an excited state after which single molecule <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> emits a single photon <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Depending on the type of light source <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the present invention also includes a means for directing <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to direct the pump light pulse <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to single molecule <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. In an exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> mode-locked laser could be used as light source <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a microscope is used as means for directing <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to direct the pumping light to the single molecule as well as a means for collecting to collect the emitted photons for detection. However, the present invention is not limited to a particular type of laser to deliver the light pulse or mechanism to direct the pumped light pulse. The present invention is also not limited to having the means for directing <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the means for collecting <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> as separate devices as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>. Examples of means for collecting <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are, for instance, but not limited to, a microscope, an optical fiber or an optical cavity such as a dielectric sphere, disk, or other optical resonator. For example, one could couple the emitted photon to an optical cavity where only one cavity mode couples to the photon. This optical cavity mode then efficiently collects the fluorescence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Examples of a single molecule are, for example, but not limited to, a terrylene molecule, a dibenzoanthanthrene molecule, a pentacene molecule, a perylene molecule or derivatives of these molecules. In general, a single molecule is a planar aromatic molecule. The single molecule is also a planar aromatic hydrocarbon with an electric dipole allowed lowest electronic excited state. Furthermore, a single molecule is a laser dye, such as, but not limited to, rhodamine or the like. The solid host is, for example, but not limited to, a p-terphenyl or a molecular crystal, such as naphthalene, durene, or similar molecule. Furthermore, the solid host is also, for example, an amorphous organic solid. Examples of a single molecule embedded in a solid host are molecules and hosts which provide a high stability at room temperature, providing 10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>photons or more. Examples of this high stability include the molecule terrylene doped into a transparent p-terphenyl crystal, or dibenzoanthanthrene in a similar molecular crystal host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a pumping scheme <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of a single molecule to the fluorescent state. The pump photons <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> excite the single molecule high into the vibrational manifold of the first electronic excited state <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. With a sufficiently short pump pulse with high energy, the single molecule can be placed in the vibronic level with very high probability. The single molecule then de-excites <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> via the usual process of vibrational relaxation on the time scale of picoseconds. The single molecule is chosen to have a very high quantum yield for fluorescence, and then an emitted photon <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is produced during the fluorescence lifetime of a few ns. The emission of a single photon <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, can be collected by a means for collecting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As an exemplary embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the chemical structures of terrylene <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and pterphenyl <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> as they have been used to provide the required single molecule in host respectively. The sample is a sublimed crystal flake (few &mgr;m thickness) of p-terphenyl doped with terrylene at low concentration of about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;11 </superscript></highlight>moles/mole. Terrylene <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> fluoresces around 579 nm in the p-terphenyl crystal, and has a fluorescence quantum yield of unity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a confocal fluorescence image <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (10 &mgr;m &times;10 &mgr;m) of single terrylene molecules embedded in crystalline p-terphenyl with continuous-wave (cw) excitation at 532 nm of about 1.5 &mgr;W, signal-to-background ratio &gt;5. The individual isolated &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> correspond to single terrylene molecules. For the generation of single photons on demand, the pump laser is switched to a pulsed source, and the focal spot is placed on top of one of the &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, thus selecting one and only one molecule for excitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a schematic and exemplary representation <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of a scanning confocal microscope setup used to characterize the single-molecule emission. In this example, green laser excitation <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> was derived from light source <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> which was an actively mode-locked picosecond Nd-YAG laser from Lightwave Electronics (model <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, pulse width 35 ps, repetition rate 100 MHz, average 1.06 &mgr;m power 220 mW). The pulsed green light <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> at 532 nm was produced by single pass second-harmonic generation in a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal (a maximum average green power of 0.2 mW was obtained for an average near infrared power of 10 mW). The excitation beam <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> was directed first to a dichroic mirror <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and then focused on the sample plane <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> by a 1.4 numerical aperture (NA) oil-immersion objective <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> of an inverted microscope. The fluorescence photons were collected by this objective, and filtered from the residual excitation light by a holographic notch filter and long pass glass filter. The emitted fluorescence <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> consists of a single photon for each pump pulse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention has now been described in accordance with several exemplary embodiments, which are intended to be illustrative in all aspects, rather than restrictive. Thus, the present invention is capable of many variations in detailed implementation, which may be derived from the description contained herein by a person of ordinary skill in the art. For instance, a possible variation and modification is the use of quantum dots or atomic ions in a solid as the emitting entities. Another variation and modification is a modified collection geometry to improve the efficiency of the collection and thus the single-photon character in the detected signal, such as 4&pgr; collection optics or attachment of the sample to the end of an optical fiber. Yet another variation and modification is the use of two or more molecules within the same focal volume to emit two or more entangled photons at a time. All such variations are considered to be within the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the following claims and their legal equivalents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to ferromagnetic thin-film structures exhibiting relatively large magnetoresistive characteristics and, more particularly, to such structures used for the storage and retrieval of digital data and for the sensing of externally generated magnetic fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Many kinds of electronic systems make use of magnetic devices including both digital systems, such as memories, and analog systems such as magnetic field sensors. Digital data memories are used extensively in digital systems of many kinds including computers and computer systems components, and digital signal processing systems. Such memories can be advantageously based on the storage of digital symbols as alternative states of magnetization in magnetic materials provided in each memory storage cell, the result being memories which use less electrical power and do not lose information upon removals of such electrical power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Magnetometers and other magnetic sensing devices are also used extensively in many kinds of systems including magnetic disk memories and magnetic tape storage systems of various kinds, magnetic signal couplers, magnetic field determiners, and the like. Such devices provide output signals representing the magnetic fields sensed thereby in a variety of situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such memory cells, and magnetic field sensors also, can often be advantageously fabricated using ferromagnetic thin-film materials, and are often based on magnetoresistive sensing of magnetic states, or magnetic conditions, therein. Such devices may be provided on a surface of a monolithic integrated circuit to provide convenient electrical interconnections between the device and the operating circuitry therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Ferromagnetic thin-film memory cells, for instance, can be made very small and packed very closely together to achieve a significant density of information storage, particularly when so provided on the surface of a monolithic integrated circuit. In this situation, the magnetic environment can become quite complex with fields in any one memory cell affecting the film portions in neighboring memory cells. Also, small ferromagnetic film portions in a memory cell can lead to substantial demagnetization fields which can cause instabilities in the magnetization state desired in such a cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These magnetic effects between neighbors in an array of closely packed ferromagnetic thin-film memory cells can be ameliorated to a considerable extent by providing a memory cell based on an intermediate separating material having two major surfaces on each of which an anisotropic ferromagnetic memory thin-film is provided. Such an arrangement provides significant &ldquo;flux closure,&rdquo; i.e. a more closely confined magnetic flux path, to thereby confine the magnetic field arising in the cell to affecting primarily just that cell. This result is considerably enhanced by choosing the separating material in the ferromagnetic thin-film memory cells to each be sufficiently thin. Similar &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structures are also used in magnetic sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the recent past, reducing the thicknesses of the ferromagnetic thin-films and the intermediate layers in extended &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structures, and adding possibly alternating ones of such films and layers, i.e. superlattices, have been shown to lead to a &ldquo;giant magnetoresistive effect&rdquo; being present in some circumstances. This effect yields a magnetoresistive response which can be in the range of up to an order of magnitude or more greater than that due to the well known anisotropic magnetoresistive response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the ordinary anisotropic magnetoresistive response, varying the difference occurring between the direction of the magnetization vector in a ferromagnetic thin-film and the direction of sensing currents passed through that film leads to varying effective electrical resistance in the film in the direction of the current. The maximum electrical resistance occurs when the magnetization vector in the field and the current direction therein are parallel to one another, while the minimum resistance occurs when they are perpendicular to one another. The total electrical resistance in such a magnetoresistive ferromagnetic film can be shown to be given by a constant value, representing the minimum resistance, plus an additional value depending on the angle between the current direction in the film and the magnetization vector therein. This additional resistance has a magnitude characteristic that follows the square of the cosine of that angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Operating magnetic fields imposed externally can be used to vary the angle of the magnetization vector in such a film portion with respect to the easy axis of that film. Such an axis comes about in the film because of an anisotropy therein typically resulting from depositing the film during fabrication in the presence of an external magnetic field oriented in the plane of the film along the direction desired for the easy axis in the resulting film. During subsequent operation of the device having this resulting film, such operational magnetic fields imposed externally can be used to vary the angle to such an extent as to cause switching of the film magnetization vector between two stable states which occur for the magnetization being oriented in opposite directions along the film&apos;s easy axis. The state of the magnetization vector in such a film can be measured, or sensed, by the change in resistance encountered by current directed through this film portion. This arrangement has provided the basis for a ferromagnetic, magnetoresistive anisotropic thin-film to serve as a memory cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In contrast to this arrangement, the resistance in the plane of a ferromagnetic thin-film is isotropic for the giant magnetoresistive effect rather than depending on the direction of the sensing current therethrough as for the anisotropic magnetoresistive effect. The giant magnetoresistive effect involves a change in the electrical resistance of the structure thought to come about from the passage of conduction electrons between the ferromagnetic layers in the &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structure, or superlattice structure, through the separating nonmagnetic layers with the resulting scattering occurring at the layer interfaces, and in the ferromagnetic layers, being dependent on the electron spins. The magnetization dependant component of the resistance in connection with this effect varies as the sine of the absolute value of half the angle between the magnetization vectors in the ferromagnetic thin-films provided on either side of an intermediate nonmagnetic layer. The electrical resistance in the giant magnetoresistance effect through the &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; or superlattice structure is lower if the magnetizations in the separated ferromagnetic thin-films are parallel and oriented in the same direction than it is if these magnetizations are antiparallel, i.e. oriented in opposing or partially opposing directions. Further, the anisotropic magnetoresistive effect in very thin films is considerably reduced from the bulk values therefor in thicker films due to surface scattering, whereas a significant giant magnetoresistive effect is obtained only in very thin films. Nevertheless, the anisotropic magnetoresistive effect remains present in the films used in giant magnetoresistive effect structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, the giant magnetoresistive effect can be increased by adding further alternate intermediate nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic thin-film layers to extend a &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structure into a stacked structure, i.e. a superlattice structure. The giant magnetoresistive effect is sometimes called the &ldquo;spin valve effect&rdquo; in view of the explanation that a larger fraction of conduction electrons are allowed to move more freely from one ferromagnetic thin-film layer to another if the magnetizations in those layers are parallel than if they are antiparallel or partially antiparallel to thereby result in the magnetization states of the layers acting as sort of a &ldquo;valve.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, a digital data memory cell based on the use of structures exhibiting the giant magnetoresistive effect is attractive as compared to structures based on use of an anisotropic magnetoresistive effect because of the larger signals obtainable in information retrieval operations with respect to such cells. Such larger magnitude signals are easier to detect without error in the presence of noise thereby leading to less critical requirements on the retrieval operation circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A memory cell structure suitable for permitting the storing and retaining of a digital bit of information, and for permitting retrieving same therefrom, has been demonstrated based on a multiple layer &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; construction in a rectangular solid. This cell has a pair of ferromagnetic layers of equal thickness and area separated by a conductive nonmagnetic layer of the same shape and area parallel to the ferromagnetic layers but of smaller thickness. These ferromagnetic layers are each a composite layer formed of two strata each of a different magnetic material, there being a relatively thin ferromagnetic stratum in each of the composite layers adjacent the nonmagnetic layer and a thicker ferromagnetic stratum in each of the composite layers adjacent the thin ferromagnetic stratum therein. The ferromagnetic material of the thick stratum in one of the composite layers is the same as that in the thin stratum in the other composite layer, and the ferromagnetic material of the thin stratum in the first composite layer is the same as the ferromagnetic material in the thick stratum of the second composite layer. Each of the composite layers is fabricated in the presence of a magnetic field so as to result in having an easy axis parallel to the long sides of the rectangular solid, or alternatively parallel to the short sides of the rectangular solid depending on desired magnetic and electrical resistance characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Thus, this memory cell structure has a pair of ferromagnetic layers of matching geometries but different magnetic materials in the strata therein to result in one such layer having effectively a greater saturation magnetization and a greater anisotropy field than the other to result in different coercivities in each. In addition, the structure results in a coupling of the magnetization between the two ferromagnetic layers therein due to exchange coupling between them leading to the magnetizations in each paralleling one another in the absence of any applied magnetic fields. As a result, the electrical resistance of the cell along its length versus applied magnetic fields in either direction parallel thereto is represented by two characteristics depending on the magnetization history of the cell. Each of these characteristics exhibits a peak in this resistance for applied longitudinal fields having absolute values that are somewhat greater than zero, one of these characteristics exhibiting its peak for positive applied longitudinal fields and the other characteristic exhibiting its peak for negative applied longitudinal fields. The characteristic followed by the resistance of the cell for relatively small applied longitudinal fields depends on which direction the magnetization is oriented along the easy axis for the one of the two ferromagnetic layers having the larger coercivity. Thus, by setting the magnetization of the layer with the higher coercivity, a bit of digital information can be stored and retained, and the value of that bit can be retrieved without affecting this retention through a determination of which characteristic the resistance follows for a relatively small applied longitudinal field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Such memory cell behavior for this structure can be modeled by assuming that the ferromagnetic layers therein are each a single magnetic domain so that positioning of the magnetization vectors in the ferromagnetic layers is based on coherent rotation, and that uniaxial anisotropies characterize those layers. The angles of the magnetization vectors in the two ferromagnetic layers with respect to the easy axis in those layers are then found by minimizing the magnetic energy of these anisotropies summed with that due to the applied external fields and to exchange coupling. That total energy per unit volume is then </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Here, K<highlight><subscript>u1 </subscript></highlight>and K<highlight><subscript>u2 </subscript></highlight>are anisotropy constants, A<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>is the exchange constant, M<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>and M<highlight><subscript>s2 </subscript></highlight>are the magnetization saturation values, and H is the externally applied field. As indicated above, once the magnetization vectors have taken an angular position with respect to the easy axis of the corresponding layer at a minimum in the above indicated energy, the effective resistance between the ends of the memory cell structure is determined by the net angle between the magnetization vectors in each of these layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Because of the assumption of single domain behavior in the ferromagnetic layers, the above equation would seemingly be expected to improve its approximation of the assistant total magnetic energy as the length and width of that memory cell structure decreased toward having submicron dimensions. However, this mode of operation described for providing the two magnetoresistive characteristics based on the history of the layer magnetizations, in depending on the differing anisotropy fields in the two ferromagnetic layers because of the differing materials used therein, becomes less and less reliable as these dimensions decrease. This appears to occur because decreasing the cell dimensions gives rise to larger and larger demagnetizing fields in the two ferromagnetic layers which, at some point, overwhelm the effects of the anisotropy fields so that the above described behavior no longer occurs as described. In addition, the magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic layers rotate together under the influences of externally applied fields at angles with respect to the corresponding easy axis at angular magnitudes much more nearly equal to one another because of the increasing demagnetization fields in these layers as the dimensions thereof decrease. As a result, these ferromagnetic layers are less and less able to have the magnetizations thereof switch directions of orientation independently of one another as the dimensions thereof decrease so that the structure they are in becomes less able to provide the above described memory function in relying on only these ferromagnetic layer anisotropy differences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An alternative memory cell structure which is more suited to submicron dimensions is a cell of the kind described above exhibiting &ldquo;giant magnetoresistive effect&rdquo; but which has the two composite ferromagnetic layers formed of different thicknesses in the thick strata therein. Thus, the thick strata in one might be on the order of 40 &angst; while that of the other might be on the order of 55 &angst; as an example. In this structure, reducing the size to submicron dimensions uses the shape anisotropy introduced by this thickness difference to provide different switching thresholds for each of the ferromagnetic composite layers in response to externally applied operating magnetic fields. The shape anisotropy leads to the effect of the demagnetizing field of one layer affecting the switching threshold of the other after the former layer has switched its magnetization direction. As a result, the thicker ferromagnetic layer has a magnetization which is fixed in orientation for externally applied operating magnetic fields that are just sufficient to switch the thinner ferromagnetic composite layer but not great enough to switch the magnetization of the thicker ferromagnetic composite layer. In effect, the demagnetizing fields as the device becomes sufficiently small dominate the anisotropy fields that result from the deposition of the ferromagnetic layers in the presence of a magnetic field. Alternatively, one of the ferromagnetic layers could have the magnetization thereof &ldquo;pinned&rdquo; in orientation by an antiferromagnetic layer provided thereon rather than by thickening that ferromagnetic layer relative to the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the absence of externally applied operating magnetic field, the two composite ferromagnetic layers have the magnetizations therein pointing in opposite directions, i.e. they are antiparallel to one another, to result in the structure as a whole having relatively small cell demagnetizing fields and small external stray fields to affect the nearby memory cells. The direction of magnetization in the thicker ferromagnetic composite layer is used to store the digital information which can only be changed in direction by externally applied fields great enough to switch magnetization directions in both composite ferromagnetic layers. That is, storing new information in the cell requires that the thicker ferromagnetic layer be capable of having the magnetization direction therein switched to be in accord with the incoming digital data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Retrieving information from such a memory cell is accomplished by switching the magnetization direction of the thinner ferromagnetic composite layer only as a basis for determining in which direction relative to the thinner layer is the magnetization oriented in the thicker layer. Typically, both such storing and retrieving has meant that there needs to be a pair of external conductors which can coincidentally supply current to result in a field large enough to switch the magnetization of the thicker ferromagnetic composite layer, but with that current in either conductor alone being able to generate fields only sufficient to switch the threshold of the thinner ferromagnetic layer. In some situations, only a single external conductor need be provided for this purpose because the sense current used in retrieving information from the memory cell can provide the coincident current needed with the current in the external conductor to switch the magnetization direction of the thicker ferromagnetic layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An alternative digital data bit storage and retrieval memory cell suited for fabrication with submicron dimensions can be fabricated that provides rapid retrievals of bit data stored therein and low power dissipation by substituting an electrical insulator for a conductor in the nonmagnetic layer. This memory cell can be fabricated using ferromagnetic thin-film materials of similar or different kinds in each of the magnetic memory films used in a &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structure on either side of an intermediate nonmagnetic layer which ferromagnetic films may be composite films, but this intermediate nonmagnetic layer conducts electrical current therethrough based primarily on a quantum electrodynamic effect &ldquo;tunneling&rdquo; current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> This &ldquo;tunneling&rdquo; current has a magnitude dependence on the angle between the magnetization vectors in each of the ferromagnetic layers on either side of the intermediate layer due to the transmission barrier provided by this intermediate layer depending on the degree of matching of the spin polarizations of the electrons tunneling therethrough with the spin polarizations of the conduction electrons in the ferromagnetic layers which are set by their magnetization directions to provide a &ldquo;magnetic valve effect&rdquo;. Such an effect results in an effective resistance or conductance characterizing this intermediate layer with respect to the &ldquo;tunneling&rdquo; current therethrough. In addition, shape anisotropy is used in such a cell to provide different magnetization switching thresholds in the two ferromagnetic layers by forming one of the ferromagnetic layers to be thicker than the other. Such devices may be provided on a surface of a monolithic integrated circuit to thereby allow providing convenient electrical connections between each such memory cell device and the operating circuitry therefor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structure for such a memory cell, based on having an intermediate thin layer of a nonmagnetic, dielectric separating material with two major surfaces on each of which a anisotropic ferromagnetic thin-film is positioned, exhibits the &ldquo;magnetic valve effect&rdquo; if the materials for the ferromagnetic thin-films and the intermediate layers are properly selected and have sufficiently small thicknesses. The resulting &ldquo;magnetic valve effect&rdquo; can yield a response which can be several times in magnitude greater than that due to the &ldquo;giant magnetoresistive effect&rdquo; in a similar sized cell structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As stated above, operating magnetic fields imposed externally can be used to vary the angle of the magnetization vector with respect to the easy axis in the ferromagnetic films of these various kinds of memory cell devices. Such operational magnetic fields imposed externally can be used to vary the angle to such an extent as to cause switching of the film magnetization vector between two stable states which occur for the magnetization being oriented in opposite directions along the film&apos;s easy axis, the state of the cell determining the value of the binary bit being stored therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the plurality of cells can be interconnected with manipulation circuitry having a plurality of transistors so that each cell has a selection transistor electrically coupled thereto that selectively substantially permits and prevents current in at least one direction along a current path through that cell. Thus, in effect, the cell is switching circuit selected rather than coincident currents-magnetic fields selected for data storing and retrieving operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a magnetic field sensor suited for fabrication with dimensions of a few microns or less can be fabricated that provides a suitable response to the presence of external magnetic fields and low power dissipation by substituting an electrical insulator for a conductor in the nonmagnetic layer. This sensor can be fabricated using ferromagnetic thin-film materials of similar or different kinds in each of the outer magnetic films provided in a &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; structure on either side of an intermediate nonmagnetic layer which ferromagnetic films may be composite films, but this insulating intermediate nonmagnetic layer again conducts electrical current therethrough based primarily on a quantum electrodynamic effect &ldquo;tunneling&rdquo; current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> This &ldquo;tunneling&rdquo; current has a magnitude dependence on the angle between the magnetization vectors in each of the ferromagnetic layers on either side of the intermediate layer due to the transmission barrier provided by this intermediate layer depending on the degree of matching of the spin polarizations of the electrons tunneling therethrough with the spin polarizations of the conduction electrons in the ferromagnetic layers, the latter being set by the layer magnetization directions to provide a &ldquo;magnetic valve effect&rdquo;. Such an effect results in an effective resistance, or conductance, characterizing this intermediate layer with respect to the &ldquo;tunneling&rdquo; current therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In these memory cell types, and in magnetic sensors that are to sense rapidly varying magnetic fields such as in magnetic disk memories and magnetic tape storage systems (&ldquo;read head sensor&rdquo;), a large memory cell device state switching rate or a large sensor material magnetization response rate to external magnetic field changes is desired to allow rapid data manipulation. The maximum operating rate of many magnetically based circuit devices is improved by the use of materials exhibiting magnetic characteristics that include, to some degree, relatively large magnetic saturations, relatively large anisotropy fields, relatively large electrical resistivity, and relatively small hysteresis, or all of these as will be shown below. Should the surface properties of materials exhibiting such properties be amenable to integration with thin-film based magnetoresistive circuit elements, such materials can be used to improve the maximum operating rate of spin dependent tunneling (SDT) devices, giant magnetoresistive (GMR) devices, and anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> SDT devices are very attractive in many applications and the technology and the technology for their design and manufacture is the most likely magnetoresistive circuit device technology to be next commercialized after the technology for the design and manufacture of GMR devices which is now being used to provide such devices in read heads for hard disk drives and in magnetic field sensor products. SDT devices have two main advantages over the state of art GMR devices that have so far been commercialized. One advantage is a factor of 4 to 6 in higher magnetic field-sensitivity, and the other is the orders of magnitude of greater electrical resistance that is easily attainable in devices of small sizes. A typical SDT junction has a magnetoresistive (MR) ratio between magnetic states of 30% to 50% and a saturation magnetic field of about 20 to 30 Oe, leading to a raw field sensitivity of about 1 to 2%/Oe, and a wide range of resistance-area products (RAP) of 10<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;-&mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. With on-chip current biasing, a magnetic field sensitivity as high as 7%/Oe has been achieved. The thermal stability has been found to be adequate for integration with integrated circuit electronics in a monolithic integrated circuit chip and for high temperature operations. These superior properties make SDT devices especially attractive for low-field/low-power system applications. They are also attractive for rapid operation applications assuming low RAP SDT junctions can be made reliably. A low junction RAP is necessary as it indicates relatively small parasitic and intrinsic junction capacitance and resistance which would otherwise lead to RC time constant circuit operation delay problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Additional examples of rapid operation magnetic thin-film circuit device applications in addition to the hard drive read heads indicated above include galvanic isolators and magnetic memory. The operating rate of these devices is a key performance parameter if manipulations of data are to be performed with sufficient rapidty to accomplish system performance goals in many of these systems. Such devices typically use the magnetoresistance effect, whereby the orientation of the magnetization of a layer or layers within the thin film multilayer structure is determined by measuring the resistance of the structure after selected device operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Several types of magnetoresistive structures are commonly used including SDT device structures, GMR spin valve device structures, GMR multilayer device structures, and AMR device structures. In all cases, the resistance changes as the orientation of the magnetizations of one or more magnetic material layers therein rotates. When these magnetoresistive devices are used in an electrical circuit, the electrical signal changes as the magnetization rotates. Thus, the rate of rotation of the magnetization of the magnetic layer or layers involved is directly related to circuit performance. That is, to the extent that the measured resistance of such a device exactly follows the rotation of the magnetization of the involved magnetic material layers therein, the magneto-dynamics of those device layers determine the rate of operation of the device. However, limitations exist in the structure and design of existing magnetic thin-film based magnetoresistive circuit devices insofar as the rate (device operations per second) at which the devices can operate. These limitations are rooted in both the physical material and the mode of magnetic operation that are typically used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The dynamic response of the magnetization orientation in a magnetic material layer to an externally applied magnetic field is well known to be described satisfactorily by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>dM/dt&equals;&minus;&ggr;M&times;H&plus;</italic></highlight>(&agr;/&verbar;<highlight><italic>M</italic></highlight>&verbar;)M&times;(<highlight><italic>dM/dt</italic></highlight>)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> where M is the magnetization, H is the total effective magnetic field, &ggr; the gyromagnetic ratio, &agr; is the damping constant, and x represents the usual vector cross product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Because the mathematical formulation is identical, it is useful to describe how the dynamic magnetic action is directly analogous to the precessing of the classical mechanics example of a single fixed point spinning top. Just as the spinning axis of the top (axis of angular momentum) precesses about the axis of an external mechanical torque, so does the magnetic moment (axis of angular momentum) of an atom or molecule precess about the axis of an external magnetic torque. The rate of this precession is directly proportional to the torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Modified spherical coordinates will be used for the following discussion. In this coordinate system, the &phgr;&equals;0&deg; plane corresponds to the Cartesian X-Y plane, and &phgr;&equals;&plus;90&deg; and &minus;90&deg; correspond to the Cartesian &plus;Z and &minus;Z axes, respectively. In the &phgr;&equals;0&deg; plane, &thgr;&equals;0&deg;, &plus;90&deg;, and &plus;180&deg;, corresponds to the &minus;X, &plus;Y, and &plus;X axes of the Cartesian system. Because of demagnetizing fields in ferromagnetic thin films, the magnetization lies in the plane of the film (&phgr;&equals;0&deg;) in steady state situations. Due to device structural considerations, the field components that can be generated in the vicinity of a thin-film device are also primarily in the &phgr;&equals;0&deg; plane. Consequently the magnetodynamic response of interest in a ferromagnetic thin-film material based magnetoresistive circuit device to an in-plane externally applied magnetic field is a rotation from one orientation to another, where both orientations are in the &phgr;&equals;0&deg; plane. That the starting and ending orientations are in the &phgr;&equals;0&deg; plane does not require that the magnetization be in the plane during the non-equilibrium &ldquo;switching&rdquo; times. The actual dynamic response involves small but important rotations out of the plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Suppose the magnetization of a thin ferromagnetic film is initially oriented to be at &thgr;&equals;0&deg; and &phgr;&equals;0&deg;. At time &equals;0 picoseconds (ps), an in-plane field, H<highlight><subscript>applied</subscript></highlight>, is provided. A torque is generated by this field with the magnitude H<highlight><subscript>applied</subscript></highlight>&times;M (this is in the first term in the LLG equation above). If H<highlight><subscript>applied </subscript></highlight>has some component in the &thgr;&equals;&plus;90&deg; direction, the initial response of the magnetization to the applied torque is a rotation out of the plane (&phgr;&gt;0). This initial response quickly generates an out-of-plane demagnetizing field in the &minus;&phgr; direction as free poles accumulate on the top and bottom surface of the film. This out-of-plane demagnetizing field then generates a torque that causes the magnetization to rotate in the plane in the positive &thgr; direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Assume, for example, H<highlight><subscript>applied </subscript></highlight>remains steadily for 1000 ps. Once &thgr;&equals;90&deg; (at about 100 ps) the torque due to it is 0. For the half-plane 90&deg;&lt;&thgr;&lt;270&deg;, the torque due to H<highlight><subscript>applied </subscript></highlight>is in the direction opposite it is for the other half-plane. Thus, the magnetization responds by rotating towards the negative &phgr; direction, generating an out-of-plane demagnetizing field along &phgr;&equals;&plus;90&deg;, which creates a torque in the &minus;&thgr; direction. The in-plane rotation of &thgr; is reversed by about t&equals;200 ps. The magnetization will oscillate between &thgr;&equals;0&deg; and 180&deg; if H<highlight><subscript>applied </subscript></highlight>is left on indefinitely. Following up with the above mechanical top analogy, the torque is provided in the mechanical top analogue by gravity or other mechanical forces or both. In the magnetic moment analogue, the torque is provided by magnetic fields. The plane of the thin film is the same as the &ldquo;floor&rdquo; for the top analogue. Where gravity causes the top axis to precess about the vertical direction, the force from vertical demagnetizing fields causes the magnetization to precess in the thin-film plane. An externally applied in-plane force on the top would initially cause nutation, not precession. Likewise, the force from an externally applied in-plane magnetic field generates out-of-plane action, not precession. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In most ferromagnetic thin-film based magnetoresistive circuit devices, some magnetic anisotropy is normally present in to the thin film. Magnetic anisotropy means that it is energetically favorable for the magnetization to lie in certain directions. A common arrangement is for the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; axis (the energetically favorable axis) to lie along &thgr;&equals;0&deg; and 180&deg; and the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; axis (energetically unfavorable) lies along &thgr;&equals;90&deg; and 270&deg;. The size of the anisotropy is often measured in terms of the applied field required to overcome it. For instance, if 75 Oe (steady state) is required to saturate the magnetization (cause it to have its maximum magnitude) at &thgr;&equals;&plus;90&deg; rather than 0&deg;, then the magnetic anisotropy is 75 Oe. The results of such a measurement are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The saturation magnetization, M<highlight><subscript>sat</subscript></highlight>, and the anisotropy field, H<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>, are defined in terms of the response of the magnetization to a field applied along the easy and hard directions of the material. The hard axis data is the linear and non-hysteretic loop. On this plot, the saturation magnetization is the maximum value of magnetization. The anisotropy field, H<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>, is the field at which the magnetization first saturates. Thus, one can see that M<highlight><subscript>sat </subscript></highlight>is about 1000 emu/cc, and H<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>is about 75 Oe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> This typical kind of anisotropy results in there being two most favorable (stable) states for the magnetization at &thgr;&equals;0&deg; and 180&deg;, and &phgr;&equals;0&deg;. These two magnetization states directly correspond to the two magnetic states of a digital circuit device such as a magnetoresistive memory (MRAM) cell or a digital mode magnetoresistive isolator. The operating rate of these devices is directly related to the time required to cause the magnetization to rotate from one state to the other in a stable fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Setting aside device operation for a bit, consider the previously discussed ferromagnetic thin film with an effective anisotropy of 75 Oe. This anisotropy field adds to any applied field and acts as a &ldquo;restoring force&rdquo; to the magnetization when it is not at &thgr;&equals;0&deg; or 180&deg;. If instead of leaving H<highlight><subscript>applied </subscript></highlight>on in its original orientation (&thgr;&equals;&plus;90&deg;), it is reversed at the optimal times (this turns out to be when the magnetization is at &thgr;&equals;90&deg; and again at 270&deg;) the magnetization will precess through an arbitrary number of oscillations. Mathematically, it can be shown that this is a &ldquo;resonance&rdquo; condition, where the driving frequency and internal restoring forces are ideally matched for maximum response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Assume there is a sinusoidal in-plane driving field at frequency f. Using the LLG equation, when the damping term (second term on the right side, with damping coefficient alpha) is much smaller than the precession term (first term on the right side), the imaginary part of the permeability (4&pgr;dM/dH) of the magnetic material is </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> where f is the excitation frequency and f<highlight><subscript>FMR </subscript></highlight>the ferromagnetic resonance frequency, or </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> where M<highlight><subscript>s </subscript></highlight>is the saturation magnetization and H<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>is the effective anisotropy field. It is clear that when excitation frequency f approaches f<highlight><subscript>FMR</subscript></highlight>, &mgr;&Prime;(f) approaches infinity. This is the mathematical way of describing the resonance phenomena. Generally, a higher f<highlight><subscript>FMR </subscript></highlight>leads to higher device operating rates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The damping factor, &agr;, in the LLG equation is an empirically measured term that takes into account all means of energy transfer from magnetic rotation to other forms. Several physical phenomena play a role in damping. Structural excitations such as phonons and magnons contribute to a larger and lesser degree, respectively. Thermal heating due to eddy currents and interactions with atomic nuclei also contribute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Eddy currents are also a problem due to their screening of H<highlight><subscript>applied</subscript></highlight>. Induced eddy currents act to generate a field in the opposite direction of that being applied. These induced fields can partially or completely cancel out the applied field. The eddy current screening effect can be characterized by a parameter called the &ldquo;skin depth&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&lgr;&equals;&lcub;&rgr;/&lsqb;&pgr;f&mgr;&rsqb;&rcub;<highlight><superscript>&frac12;</superscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> where &rgr; is the material electrical resistivity, f is the frequency of the applied field, and &mgr; is the permeability </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The skin depth, &lgr;, is the depth at which the net field (applied minus eddy current field) is 1/e times that at the surface. The effects of eddy current screening at a given frequency of device operation can best be minimized by increasing &rgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Many present-day magnetoresistive devices are switched in a quasi-static mode. That is, an in-plane magnetic field is applied parallel to the direction of desired resulting magnetization. After enough time, the magnetization will be oriented along this direction since it has the lowest magnetostatic energy. However, the &ldquo;path&rdquo; that the magnetization takes during this reorientation is quite complicated, as it probably takes in several cycles of precessional rotation, and/or domain wall motion. If possible, magnetic switching should not involve magnetic domain wall motion, but rather precession that is uniform across the device. Domain walls may exist prior to the attempt at switching, or they may be nucleated at energetically favorable locations in the initial stage of switching. Once initiated, domain wall propagation occurs through the film until equilibrium is reached. At all points, the local magnetic rotation that makes up the domain wall action is described by the same LLG equation that applies to uniform precession. Consequently, domain wall motion can never be faster than uniform precession, and is usually much slower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Generally when operating in the dynamic switching regime, a material with a higher f<highlight><subscript>FMR </subscript></highlight>will take less time and energy to switch. Consider again the two-state magnetic thin-film based magnetoresistive circuit device. In order to switch the magnetization from &thgr;&equals;0&deg; to 180&deg; at or near the f<highlight><subscript>FMR</subscript></highlight>, special applied field timing is desirable. An in-plane applied field perpendicular to the magnetization (&thgr;&equals;&plus;90&deg;) is needed to initiate the out-of-plane precession, and the resulting vertical demagnetizing field-induced in-plane rotation. As noted above, however, the in-plane applied field must not be left on indefinitely or a continual oscillation between &thgr;&equals;0&deg; and 180&deg; will result. The anisotropy energy and damping coefficient play important roles in this switching action. In an overdamped case, the applied field must be left on until &thgr;&gt;90&deg;, at which point the anisotropy field will cause the magnetization to stabilize at &thgr;&equals;180&deg;. In the underdamped case, the applied field must be left on until &thgr; approaches 180&deg;. Here the same field that induces acceleration when the magnetization is at 0 degrees also induces deceleration when the magnetization approaches &thgr;&equals;180&deg; degrees. It may also be possible to divide the applied field pulse into two parts at the beginning and end, saving some energy. In this case, the first pulse initiates rotation while the second pulse halts it. At increasingly higher frequencies, increasingly larger fields must be applied to induce the magnetization to precess in the allotted time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A high saturation magnetization and a high magnetic anisotropy field for a magnetic material makes its FMR frequency high, a high material resistivity makes its skin depth large, and reversals of its magnetization direction through primarily rotation makes that magnetization respond fast to a rapidly changing applied magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In order to be considered a good soft magnetic material, &mgr; needs to be high, regardless of the speed. Also, &lgr; decreases with f and is the thickness limit (for any given f) for the magnetic material, beyond which any additional material becomes magnetically inactive. Therefore, the greater the value of &lgr; the better. We see right away that there is a conflicting requirement for H<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>in the magnetic material. A high H<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>is needed for a high f<highlight><subscript>FMR</subscript></highlight>, but a low H<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>is needed for a high permeability &mgr;. Therefore, a compromise has to be reached, depending on the specific application for the magnetic material. For very high frequency applications, such as RF devices, a bias field is normally needed to achieve a high f<highlight><subscript>FMR</subscript></highlight>. However, if the induced anisotropy field can be enhanced in the material, there will be a reduced requirement for the biasing. On the other hand, there is always a desire for a magnetic material with a large saturation magnetization and a high resistivity, along with a low loss at the operating frequency. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> As described above, a ferromagnetic thin-film based magnetoresistive circuit device will have enhanced operating rates if several material characteristics exist for the &ldquo;free&rdquo; layer of the device. These are quickly summarized as high f<highlight><subscript>FMR</subscript></highlight>, high resistivity, and high saturation magnetization. The present invention describes the use of a class of materials that have these high operation rate characteristics to a greater degree than commonly used materials as a ferromagnetic free layer within ferromagnetic thin-film based magnetoresistive circuit devices. The relevant class of materials can best be described as a ferromagnetic thin-film material having relatively higher conductivity ferromagnetic nanogranules embedded in a relatively lower conductivity intergranular matrix. The thin-film combination of nanogranules within an intergranular matrix will be referred to as a nanocomposite thin film. The nanocomposite thin film is an inhomogeneous mixture of phases, where a ferromagnetic material dominates the composition of the nanogranular phase and a nonmagnetic material dominates the composition of the intergranular phase. Nanogranules are specified by their physical dimensions. The maximum of the nanogranule size distribution is typically on the order of 10 nm or less. The high end of the size distribution could well extend beyond 100 nm, though such large nanogranules would be rare. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a layer diagram of a ferromagnetic nanocomposite layer as it is used in a typical SDT structure. Corresponding to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a plan view <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B of only the nanocomposite layer. The ferromagnetic nanogranules <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, together with the intergranular matrix <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, form the ferromagnetic nanocomposite layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Note that the nanogranules need not extend from top to bottom of the nanocomposite layer. The underlying base for the layers shown here is typically a semiconductor-based integrated circuit wafer <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, whose top surface is typcially passivated with about 500 nm of SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> typically has monolithic circuit components integrated therein. Subsequently formed vias connect the ferromagnetic thin film devices in order to operate with and receive signals from them. A 50 nm TaN etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and 200 nm Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are formed on the semiconductor wafer by sputter deposition. Together, layers <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, form a generic insulating substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that supports and provides a suitable surface for the subsequent formation of the SDT structure. Upon surface <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, sputter deposition of a 4 nm Ta layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a 10 nm Cu layer <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and a 2 nm Ta layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, forms a multi-strata buffer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the 10 nm thick ferromagnetic nanocomposite CoFe-HfO thin film layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is also formed by RF sputter deposition from a CoFeHf target whose composition is Co 56, Fe 25, Hf 19 (all in atomic %). However, a trace concentration of oxygen is provided in addition to the usual 30 mTorr of Ar in the sputter gas during deposition. The amount of oxygen in the sputter gas controls, in part, the oxygen content of the resulting CoFe-HfO layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> An Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>tunnel barrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed by sputter deposition of aluminum onto layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. After deposition, the aluminum is oxidized in a plasma of Ar/O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The amount of oxygen in the sputter gas controls, in part, the oxygen content of the resulting Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The unoxodized aluminum layer expands by approximately 30% when it is oxidized. Layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> ranges in thickness from 0.5 nm to 4 nm depending upon the desired resistance of the subsequently formed spin dependent tunnel junctions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A composite ferromagnetic &ldquo;hard&rdquo; layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided on top of tunnel barrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through further sputter deposition. The first stratum, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, of this hard layer is a 5 nm thickness of CoFe from a target of composition Co 95, Fe 5 (atomic %). The second stratum, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, is a 30 nm thickness of antiferromagnetic CrPtMn whose composition is Cr 45, Pt 10, Mn 45 (atomic %). During the deposition of layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a magnetic field of 20 Oe is applied to induce the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; anisotropy axis. Post-deposition annealing of the finished SDT junction material stack is done in ambient atmosphere at a temperature of 250&deg; C. for one hour in an applied magnetic field applied of 4000 Oe parallel to the easy axis. This anneal serves to enhance the &ldquo;hardness&rdquo; of the hard layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by enhancing the exchange coupling between its strata <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The anneal also improves the quality of the tunnel barrier layer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Several ferromagnetic nanocomposite materials exhibit the resistive and magnetic properties desired for the &ldquo;free&rdquo; layer of a magnetoresistive thin film structure. CoFe-HfO (hereafter, a hyphenated nanocomposite material composition identifies the pre-hyphen species as the ferromagnetic nanogranular phase and the post-hyphen species as the intergranular phase) is one of the best. Others include Fe-HfO, Fe-CrTaN, Fe-HfCN, Fe-HfN, Co-HfTa, Co-CrO, Co-HfO, etc. This group of materials has great potential for rapid operation device applications when appropriately situated in ferromagnetic thin-film based magnetoresistive devices. The subsequent description will be based on only CoFe-HfO but will often apply to the rest of the foregoing nanocomposite materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure shows that relatively thin (on the order of 10 nm) films of nanocomposite CoFe-HfO have excellent resistive and magnetic properties, and that such films are amenable to inclusion in magnetoresistive structures. Though ferromagnetic thin-film based magnetoresistive circuit devices typically have soft film thicknesses of about 10 nm, there are some uses for ferromagnetic nanocomposite materials in thicknesses up to 1,000 nm. This is especially true in the variants of the SDT structure, where only the interfaces of the ferromagnetic films with the tunnel barrier (and not the thickness) determine the nominal resistance of the device. A specific example of a use for a 1,000 nm layer is in a structure called a &ldquo;spring magnet&rdquo; where the non-tunnel barrier surface of the free layer is pinned by exchange coupling to a high-anisotropy material. This structure can have an excellent combination of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; and non-hysteretic magnetic characteristics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> CoFe-HfO has a high saturation magnetization combined with a high resistivity. The high saturation magnetization comes from the fact that the higher conductivity ferromagnetic nanogranular phase, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, mimics the magnetic properties of the base CoFe alloy. Though some amount of Hf and O may reside in the nanogranular phase, it is desirable that the HfO be largely in the intergranular matrix, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This is because the nanogranules will not be ferromagnetic if they contain too many impurities. Non-ferromagnetic impurities act to reduce or eliminate the ferromagnetic behavior of a ferromagnetic host by interfering with the exchange coupling between neighboring ferromagnetic atoms. The HfO rich intergranular phase, however is desirable for its high resistivity. The ferromagnetic nanocomposite structure, then, is an ideal physical phase mixture of highly magnetic conductive material with resistive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The ferromagnetic nanocomposite structure <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is especially compatible with the electrical operation and fabrication of magnetic tunnel junctions. The electrical conduction across a tunnel barrier (typically about 1.5 nm of Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) is proportional to the density of conduction electrons on both sides of the tunnel barrier at a given point. The majority of tunneling current from a nanocomposite layer will be from the relatively higher conductivity regions. In the case of CoFe-HfO, the high conductivity regions are also the most magnetic regions. The quality of tunnel junctions depends strongly on the stoichiometry of the barrier material <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. If there is an excess or deficit of oxygen in the barrier, it can have poorer insulating properties, or even conductive &ldquo;pinholes&rdquo;. It is known that annealing tunnel junction structures can improve their structure and properties. This improvement is thought to be related to the migration of oxygen to where it is needed. The affinity of unoxodized aluminum for oxygen is stronger than that of the ferromagnetic transition metals Ni, Fe, and Co, so when oxygen is freed up due to the addition of thermal energy, the Al barrier takes what it needs, and leaves the rest for the &ldquo;free&rdquo; and &ldquo;hard&rdquo; ferromagnetic layers adjacent to either surface of the barrier. In the structure using a ferromagnetic nanocomposite layer for the &ldquo;free&rdquo; layer, the lower conductivity intergranular matrix <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> likely acts as a sort of oxygen reservoir. As a result, the stoichiometry of the barrier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be better, and the quality of the ferromagnetic material at the barrier interface can also be better because excess oxygen can go to the intergranular matrix rather then ferromagnet nanogranules <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> There are likely varying degrees of oxidation in the CoFe-rich granules. It is unlikely that there is a sharp interface between CoFe-rich nanogranules and HfO rich intergranular regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The magnetic properties of the matrix are not easily measured on an atomic scale. Either intergranular matrix <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is thin enough to allow good magnetostatic coupling from granule-to-granule, or it may have some ferromagnetic properties that aid in coupling, or there may be regions of physical continuity of CoFe rich material between nanogranules <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The magnetic moment within ferromagnetic nanocomposite layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, on an atomic scale, is sure to vary considerably as a function of position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Several high quality single layer CoFe-HfO films of thicknesses from 10 nm to 1000 nm have been formed on a Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>surface using sputter deposition. The film properties have been analyzed using many tools including a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), B-H Loop Tracer, SQUID magnetometer, permeameter analyzer, FMR spectrometer, pulse-field stripline tester, X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray fluorescent spectrometer (XRF), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and magnetic force microscope (MFM). The various analyses reveal that these are ferromagnetic nanocomposite thin films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Several analytical tools can further confirm the nature of the nanocomposite structure on a near-atomic length scale. Such measurements provide additional information about its detailed physical structure. High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy can give cross-sectional views with almost atomic resolution. Electron microbeam diffraction is a technique where spatial resolution of the usual electron diffraction is enhanced by reducing the size of the electron beam. When the beam is rastered over the cross-section of the nanocomposite structure, the diffracted electrons form a distinctive pattern if the beam is incident on a single granule. The diffracted electrons form a concentric circles pattern if the beam is incident upon an amorphous material. Standard X-ray diffractometers provide similar information, but it is difficult to focus the incident beam on a small enough area to be practical as an &ldquo;imager&rdquo; of the structure with 1 nm resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A 10 nm thick CoFe-HfO film formed by sputter deposition was found to have a smooth surface, with an rms roughness of 2.4 &angst; when deposited on a silicon nitride substrate having a rms roughness of 2.0 &angst;. This high degree of surface smoothness is critical for tunnel junction fabrication, especially when the Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>barrier is deposited on top of the CoFe-HfO. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The resistivity of CoFe-HfO has a typical value of 1000 &mgr;&OHgr;-cm, which changes very little over the temperature range of 20 to 175&deg; C. This temperature dependence is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. This high resistivity prevents significant eddy current screening effects for frequencies up to tens of GHz in most applications. The small temperature dependence leads to a small resistive temperature coefficient (TCR) that is desirable for almost all applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> After being annealed in a magnetic field, such films have excellent soft magnetic properties with a well-defined uniaxial anisotropy. The anisotropy field H<highlight><subscript>k </subscript></highlight>is typically 65 to 75 Oe for films with thickness ranging from 50 to 200 &angst;, which is suitable for SDT, spin valve, and other GMR multilayer devices. The saturation magnetization is about 1.2 Tesla. Using the measured anisotropy field and saturation magnetization values, the FMR frequency is calculated to be about 2.2 GHz. Typical hysteresis loops of a 100 &angst; film show a very square easy axis hysteresis loop, a closed hard axis loop with linear response of magnetization with the field before saturation. The easy and hard axis hysteresis loops of such a 10 nm film are given in the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which shows 4&pgr;M<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>&equals;1.2T, an easy axis coercivity of 8 Oe, and a closed hard axis loop with an adequate uniaxial anisotropy field of 65 Oe. A 5.0 nm thick CoFe-HfO film showed similar properties. A comparison of CoFe-HfO with permalloy, the most commonly used class of soft magnetic materials, is given in Table 1 below. The composition of permalloy is Ni 80, Fe 20 (atomic %). Clearly, CoFe-HfO is better than permalloy for each of these properties that are particularly important for high rate of operation devices.

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Permeameter measurements on single layer CoFe-HfO films result in weak signals so that much of the data has to be averaged to get more accurate values for the initial permeability, FMR frequency and damping constant. FMR spectra have also been taken and the initial permeability and the precessional frequency have been calculated from the FMR data and compared with the observed values. These calculated values included the anticipated effects of eddy currents based on the sample thickness and the resistivity. The permeability measured here is as defined earlier, &mgr;&equals;&lsqb;4&pgr;M/H&rsqb;. This is simply a measure of the response of M to an applied field H. The permeability measurements were made with oscillating excitation fields of constant amplitude ranging in frequency from 100 MHz to 3 GHz. The result of the measurement is that the precession frequency is about 2.2 GHz, and the permeability is about 200, both of which compare well with theoretical calculations based on the static magnetic properties. The damping constant, &agr;, is relatively small, 0.005 for a 10 nm sample, compared with 0.02 for permalloy. It is also observed that this value increases with the film thickness, to 0.02 at 3000 &angst; and 0.04 at 1 &mgr;m as measured using a permeameter. With the large material resistivity value, the effects of eddy currents on the permeability and the precessional frequency are minimal. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> show predicted and measured, respectively, permeameter spectra for a 1000 nm thick CoFe-HfO film. The solid lines are the real part of the permeability, while the dashed lines are the imaginary part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the FMR spectra for a 200 &angst; thick CoFe-HfO film. While the field indicated on the x-axis of the plot is swept from 700 Oe to 1200 Oe, a much smaller 9.386 GHz field is applied perpendicular to the DC applied field. The signal indicated by the solid curve is the result when the DC applied field is parallel to the easy axis while the dashed curve is the result when the DC applied field is parallel to the hard axis. Some simple math shows that the separation in field between the zero crossing of these two curves is twice H<highlight><subscript>k</subscript></highlight>, as indicated on the plot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Pulsed magnetic field measurements using an inductive stripline technique have been performed with the stripline excited by a source to supply a film hard-axis magnetic field excursion of 3.3 Oe with a field rise time of 0.3 ns in the absence of any easy axis field. The measured response is proportional to the time derivative of the magnetization along the film hard axis with the results for a 100 nm CoFe-HfO film shown in the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In comparison, a similar plot is given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> for a typical permalloy film. Note that the period of the free oscillations, or &ldquo;ringing&rdquo;, is &tilde;0.4 ns for the CoFe-HfO film and &tilde;1.7 ns for the permalloy film. These values correlate well with the permeameter and FMR measurements. Note that in all three high rate analyses shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the resulting oscillation of magnetization is not full precession. Rather, the magnetization is oscillating through small angles about the easy axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> CoFe-HfO films with properties as shown above are ideal for incorporation into magnetoresistance based high operating rate circuit device structures as the magnetic free layer. The formation of such a structure is described here. The strata shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> must be further processed in order to fabricate useful magnetoresistive structures on monolithic integrated circuit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The result of a typical SDT junction fabrication process is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</cross-reference>. Prior to any etching, a conductive 10 nm thick Al buffer layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a 10 nm thick CrSi etch stop layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and 75 nm thick Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>hard-mask layer (not shown, as it is subsequently removed) are formed onto magnetically hard layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using sputter deposition. A photoresist mask is created, using standard photolithographic techniques, on the surface of the hard-mask layer which is then etched using reactive ion etching (RIE). The RIE removes unmasked material down to etch stop layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The photoresist mask is removed, and the wafer is further etched in an ion mill. Top electrodes of tunnel junctions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed once the ion mill removes unmasked material down to tunnel barrier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and also the 75 nm hard mask layer from the masked areas. Bottom electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed using a similar process to mask and etch exposed tunnel barrier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, free layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and buffer layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, stopping on or within Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Tunnel junctions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; are passivated by sputter deposition of 100 nm thick Si3N4 layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Contact windows <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed in passivation layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> using lithography and RIE. Via <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to metal layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the integrated circuit structure <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is also formed this way. Aluminum interconnections <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime; are formed by patterning, using photolithography and RIE, a 100 nm layer of Al that has been formed using sputter deposition onto passivating layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and into windows <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;, and via <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Thus, two tunnel junctions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; having a magnetically hard layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> share common bottom electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which has the free magnetic layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. While it is not necessary to have two top electrodes per bottom electrode, this arrangement provides for better use of physical space and an easier fabrication process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> At this point, the magnetoresistive properties of the SDT devices can be tested. The tunnel resistance between the two magnetic layer electrodes on either side of the insulating barrier layer depends on the relative angle of the two magnetic layer electrode magnetizations. The resistance is relatively low when the two magnetizations are parallel, and relatively high when antiparallel. The top magnetic layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, typically FeCo, is pinned using an antiferromagnetic layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, typically CrPtMn, positioned immediately next to it. Under small external magnetic fields, less than several hundred Oe, the pinned layer magnetization direction changes little. Therefore, an electrical signal can be obtained between the two electrodes by manipulating the magnetization direction of the free layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The typical form of the SDT junction versus applied magnetic field characteristic is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The external field is applied along the easy axis. The junction exhibits a 44% magnetoresistance ratio. This junction has CoFe-HfO as magnetically free layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. It&apos;s lateral dimensions are 33 &mgr;m&times;25 &mgr;m, and the resistance-area product (RAP) is 5.5 M&OHgr;-&mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The RAP is a property of the tunnel barrier, and should be the same regardless of the size of a device on a given wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The dependences of the magnetic tunnel junction properties as a function of bias voltage across the junction are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>A, the dependence of the tunneling current on the junction bias voltage is shown for the magnetizations of the magnetic layer electrodes being parallel and antiparallel. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, the dependence of the junction resistances on the junction bias voltage is shown for the magnetizations of the magnetic layer electrodes being parallel and antiparallel. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>C, the dependence of the magnetoresistance ratio on the junction bias voltage is shown. The bias voltage, V<highlight><subscript>&frac12;</subscript></highlight>, across the junction at which the magnetoresistance ratio is half of the maximum is about 450 mV. This is similar to that resulting from a similar structure in which NiFeCo replaces the CoFe-HfO shown here. For the particular junctions characterized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>, the RAP value is too high to operate at 1 GHz. However, the high magnetoresistance of these junctions demonstrate that CoFe-HfO has a high spin-polarization and is compatible with Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>barrier, which are keys for high performance SDT tunnel junctions. The RAP can be reduced making the barrier thinner, or by using an aluminum nitride (AlN) barrier instead of Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> gives the device size dependence of the magnetoresistance ratio and RAP values for SDT devices made with AlN tunnel barriers. A small 2.5&times;2.5 mm junction with layer structure Si(100)/Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>/Ta 4/Cu 10/Ta2/CoFe-HfO 10/AlN/FeCo5/CrPtMn 30 (all thicknesses in nm) has a low RAP value of 958 &OHgr;-&mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. However, the magnetoresistance ratio has a relatively low value of 6.9%. The dependence of measured magnetoresistance and RAP vs. junction size is due to uneven current distribution across the tunnel barrier. The lateral current flow in the electrodes required for the current to reach all areas of those electrodes. This is a parasitic series resistance to the tunnel junction which reduces the measured magnetoresistance ratio thereby giving an erroneously low indication of the junction performance in larger devices with a low RAP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Multiple SDT junction pairs can be electrically connected in series to form a resistance &ldquo;leg&rdquo; that can have a higher total voltage that can be applied to it than to a single junction or junction pair. This is often done in circuits where the supply voltage is much higher than the 100 mV that is safe to put across a single junction. A typical SDT circuit device is formed of a resistance bridge containing four SDT resistor legs and associated conditioning electronics. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows the plan view of a monolithic integrated circuit based magnetoresistive signal isolator based on a resistance bridge. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a simple schematic of the bridge plus amplifier arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The two junctions <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&prime; on bottom electrode <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>) together form junction pair <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Two such pairs, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>&prime; form bridge leg <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which contains two junction pairs, or four tunnel junctions. Four such bridge legs, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&Prime;, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;, are electrically connected using interconnections <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>&prime;, vias <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&prime; to metal interconnect <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The integrated circuit substrate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> supports this SDT resistance bridge. An electrical isolation barrier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and surface conditioner <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are provided on top of SDT interconnects <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and passivation layer <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and directly supporting 1.5 micron thick Al planar coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A second isolation barrier <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> separates coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from permalloy shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Isolation barrier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed to a thickness of 2 microns to 18 microns by performing the following sequence one or more times: spin-coat with BCB followed by prescribed soft bake. The top surface of BCB isolation barrier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> supports 500 nm Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>surface conditioning layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> formed by sputter deposition. The thickness of isolation barrier <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is determined by the required standoff voltage for a given electrical isolation application. A typical requirement is for 2500 Volts standoff, for which 18 microns of BCB is required. Planar coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed by standard photolithography and RIE etching 1.5 microns of sputter-deposited Al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The function of the isolator structure is to pass information in electronic format without having a true electrical connection. The magnetoresistive thin film based signal isolator performs this function by converting an electric signal at inputs <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into a magnetic field which is converted back to an electric signal by the SDT bridge and its output circuitry. The input signal current through coil <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> generates magnetic fields in a direction over bridge legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;, that is antiparallel to that over bridge legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. Due to the asymmetric nature of the transfer curve in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the resistance of bridge legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;, will be in the high state when that of bridge legs <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; is in the low state, and visa versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Vias <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>&Prime; contain metallized connections to integrated circuit components below. Connections <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect the SDT bridge to positive terminal <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>&prime; and negative terminals <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>&prime;, respectively, of a voltage or current source. Connections <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> connect the SDT bridge output leads to input terminals <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; of signal amplifier <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The electrical signal from amplifier <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is available at output terminal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Spin valve structures are similar to a SDT structures, but have a conducting spacer layer, e.g. Cu, in place of the insulating Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>tunnel barrier in SDT structures. They exhibit the &ldquo;giant magnetoresistive effect&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;spin dependent tunneling&rdquo; effect. In patterning spin valve material, only one etch step is needed instead of two as for SDT structures. The current path in spin valve structures primarily follows the film plane instead of flowing perpendicular to that plane as in SDT structures (there can be spin valve structures with current flowing perpendicular to the film plane although they are not commonly used at present). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Spin valve devices for high rate of operation applications can be made using CoFe-HfO layers as magnetic free layers as shown in layer view <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. All of the layers in this magnetoresistive stack are provided by sputter deposition onto Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. From bottom to top, the stack consists of 5 nm CoFe-HfO free layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, 1 nm CoFe interface layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, 3.5 nm Cu intermediate layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, 5 nm CoFe pinned layer <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, and 300 nm CrPtMn pinning layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Typical resistance versus applied field traces (resistance represented by voltage since a constant current is used to measure the resistance) are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</cross-reference>. A wide range externally applied magnetic field result is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>A, and a near zero range externally applied field result is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</cross-reference>. The magnetoresistive properties are qualitatively similar to those of spin valves using permalloy and other common ferromagnetic materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> With a CoFe-HfO/CoFe ratio of 50/10 for the magnetic free layer, the magnetic performance will be dominated by the CoFe-HfO layer while the CoFe layer enhances the magnetoresistance value by assuring substantial spin polarization at the interface with the intermediate copper layer. Although the magnetoresistance values can be further improved, the results demonstrate the use of nanocomposite CoFe-HfO in a spin valve structure. CoFe-HfO can also be used in other GMR structures such as a symmetric spin valve structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> with three magnetic layers separated from one another by two nonmagnetic layers. All of the layers in this magnetoresistive stack are provided by sputter deposition onto Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>substrate <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. From bottom to top, the stack consists of 5 nm permalloy buffer layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, 30 nm CrPtMn pinning layers <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, 5 nm CoFe pinned layers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, 3.5 nm Cu non-magnetic intermediate layers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, 1 nm CoFe interface layers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and 6 nm CoFe-HfO layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, The middle ferromagnetic strata <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> form the magnetic free layer and the outer strata <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are pinned magnetic layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The high operating rate benefit of using CoFe-HfO as the magnetic free layer of a &ldquo;spin valve&rdquo; would be just as described for SDT structures. Furthermore, state of the art magnetoresistance techniques such as specular scattering, interface dusting, and coupling controls can all be applied to any of the GMR structures having CoFe-HfO layers therein. Vertical GMR (VGMR) multilayer structures, having current flowing perpendicular to plane (CPP), can be improved by replacing low resistivity ferromagnetic material layers (permalloy, for example) in currently used structures with high resistivity CoFe-HfO. The magnetic hardness of CoFe-HfO layers can be varied by making them thicker (harder) or thinner (softer). The nomnagnetic material layers (spacers) can be of a good conductor such as Cu. This structure can be used to form magnetoresistive memory (MRAM) cells with the stored information kept in the thicker hard layers that are &ldquo;read&rdquo; by switching the magnetizations of the thinner or softer layers. Whether the resistance increases or decreases tells whether they are magnetized parallel or antiparallel to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> A typical structure for vertical conduction would have n repeats of the &lsqb;thick CoFe-HfO/Cu/thin CoFe-HfO Cu&rsqb; structure, with n&equals;2 to 8. A layer view of the construction of such a structure is represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>.

Magnetic CoFe and NiFeCo materials have resistivities of about 12 to 20 &mgr;&OHgr;-cm in bulk, and Cu has a resistivity of 2 &mgr;&OHgr;-cm. CoFe-HfO, on the other hand, can easily be made with a resistivity greater than 1000 &mgr;&OHgr;-cm which is much higher than the values given above for either CoFe and NiFeCo. Therefore, the sheet resistance of a spin valve layer stack substituting CoFe-HfO for the magnetic layers material will be higher than that of a stack with magnetic layers formed with CoFe and NiFeCo. However, the dominant conduction paths are due to the nonmagnetic layers of Cu interleaved with the magnetic layers which have a much lower resistivity than the magnetic layers. These nonmagnetic Cu layers provide alternative current conduction paths to those provided by the magnetic layers of a higher conductivity to thereby shunt current through them from the magnetic layers leading to the so-called shunting effect. If, however, Cu in the nonmagnetic layers is replaced by either CuAu or CuAgAu, which have a resistivity of 8 to 10 &mgr;&OHgr;-cm, a spin valve structure of FeHfO/CuAgAu/CoFe-HfO/CrPtMn (and other variations) will have a much higher sheet resistance, possibly quadruple that of the typical currently used spin valve stack described above. Having a higher sheet resistance leads to a higher total resistance for the same number of squares (i.e. same device area) thereby resulting in either lower power consumption or fewer squares or device material (i.e. smaller device area) for the same device resistance resulting in a lower cost. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> An SDT device has to be optimized as a whole to achieve high operating rates. There are basically four considerations. They are magnetics, tunnel junction transport, electrical circuits, and electronics, all of which must be fast and compatible with each other. The overall speed of a device is limited by the slowest aspect. First, the magnetic material itself must be capable of fast switching. The limiting factors are, as given above, the ferromagnetic resonance frequency (FMR), the mode of magnetization reversal, and eddy current screening. Dimensional resonance is not expected to be a problem at the operating rates of interest. All of these requirements can be accommodated by using CoFe-HfO films in a precessional switching mode. In order to do this, the easy axis (rest state) of the films must be perpendicular to a precession-inducing impulse field, as described in the background. This is not the way the majority of present-day devices work, though quasi-static switching where the easy axis is parallel to the applied field. The second consideration is the intrinsic RC time constant for a SDT junction. Because of the very rapid change of junction resistance with barrier thickness, the RC constant for a junction is basically proportional to the junction&apos;s RAP. The lower the RAP is, the smaller the RC constant is, with a RAP value of 13 k&OHgr;-&mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>corresponding to a RC value of 1 nanosecond. Therefore, a RAP value of several k&OHgr;-&mgr;m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>will be adequate for nanosecond device operation. The third consideration is essentially the RC and LC constants of the whole circuit device, with R being the device resistance and C and L the device parasitic capacitance and inductance. Design optimization is needed to limit the R, C, and L levels. The fourth consideration is the speed of the conditioning electronics. As a rule of thumb, the product of the gain and bandwidth is constant for a given amplifier. Therefore, the lower the gain, the faster the speed. The high signal level of a SDT device makes it possible for the voltage gain to be as low as 1. For example, with just 1-volt supply to a SDT bridge with a 30% magnetoresistance ratio for individual SDT resistors, the bridge output swing will be 300 mV for an isolator device with four active resistors, and 150 mV for a digital field sensor with two active resistors. This high signal level can be fed directly into a logic device without any amplification. Other techniques such as low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) and submicron BiCMOS fabrication process typically based on a silicon substrate also need to be used to achieve high rate of operation electronics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In addition to the magnetoresistive galvanic signal isolators, magnetic field sensors and memory cell described above, there are many other magnetic based circuit devices that can benefit from substituting CoFe-HfO for the magnetic materials currently being used therein, such as fast re-programmable logic devices, other MRAM memory devices, read heads for magnetic recording disk drives, and derivative devices. Some of these devices will require operation in a &ldquo;linear&rdquo; mode as opposed to the two state &ldquo;digital&rdquo; mode described above. Such a linear mode also takes advantage of the excellent high rate of operation properties of CoFe-HfO ferromagnetic nanocomposite then films. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method for forming arrays of metal, alloy, semiconductor or magnetic clusters is described. The method comprises placing a scaffold on a substrate, the scaffold comprising molecules selected from the group consisting of polynucleotides, polypeptides, and perhaps combinations thereof. Polypeptides capable of forming &agr; helices are currently preferred for forming scaffolds. Arrays are then formed by contacting the scaffold with plural, monodispersed ligand-stabilized clusters.

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention concerns a method for forming organized arrays of metal, alloy, semiconductor and/or magnetic clusters for use in the manufacture of electronic devices, such as high density memory storage and nanoelectronic devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Fundamentally new technologies are required to continue increasing device integration density and speed. Conventional metal-oxide semiconductor-field-effect transistors soon will reach fundamental density and speed limits as a result of quantum mechanical tunneling. In order to scale electronic device sizes down to nanometer dimensions, systems containing increasingly fewer numbers of particles must be considered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The ultimate limit is a system in which the transfer of a single charge quanta corresponds to information transfer or some type of logical operation. Such single electron systems are presently the focus of intense research activity. See, for example, <highlight><italic>Single Charge Tunneling, Coulomb Blockade Phenomena in Nanostructures</italic></highlight>, edited by H. Grabert and M.H . Devoret, NATO ASI Series B: Physics Vol. 294 (1992). These systems have potential application to nanoelectronic circuits that have integration densities far exceeding those of present day semiconductor technology. See, <highlight><italic>Quantum Transport in Ultrasmall Devices</italic></highlight>, edited by D. K. Ferry, H. L. Grubin, C. Jacoboni, and A. Jauho, NATO ASI Series B: Physics Vol. 342 (1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Single electron transistors based on the concept of Coulomb blockade are one proposed technology for realizing ultra-dense circuits. K. K. Likharev&apos;s <highlight><italic>Single Electron Transistors: Electrostatic Analogs of the DC SQUIDS,&rdquo; IEEE Trans. Magn. </italic></highlight>23:1142 (1987); and <highlight><italic>IBM J. Res. Dev. </italic></highlight>32:144 (1988). Coulomb blockade is the suppression of single electron tunneling into metallic or semiconductor islands. In order to achieve Coulomb blockade, the charging energy of an island must greatly exceed the thermal energy. To reduce quantum fluctuations the tunneling resistance to the island should be greater than the resistance quantum he<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. Coulomb blockade itself may be the basis of conventional logic elements, such as inverters. Id. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Equally promising is the fact that the Coulomb blockade effect can be used to pump charges one-by-one through a chain of dots to realize a frequency-controlled current source in which the current is exactly equal to I&equals;ef, where f is the clocking frequency. See, L. J. Geerligs et al.&apos;s <highlight><italic>Frequency</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>locked Turnstile Device for Single Electrons, Phys. Rev.

Lett. </italic></highlight>17:249 (1992). Such turnstile devices are of fundamental interest as highly accurate current standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The clocking of charge through an array is also one model of information storage. It is possible that computation may be based on switching of currents rather than charge which, due to the extreme accuracy of single electron current sources, may be more robust towards unwanted fluctuations than single electron transistor-based circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One of the most promising technologies for realizing terabyte memories is founded on the principle of the Coulomb blockade.

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Microelectronic devices based on the principle of Coulomb blockade have been proposed as a new approach to realizing electronic circuits or memory densities that go beyond the predicted scaling limit for present day semiconductor technology. While the operation of Coulomb blockade devices has been demonstrated, most operate only at greatly reduced temperatures and require sophisticated nanofabrication procedures. The size scales necessary for Coulomb blockade effects at such relatively elevated temperatures of about room temperature impose limits on the number, uniformity and connectivity of quantum dots. As a result, alternative methodologies of nanofabrication need to be investigated and developed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a new process for making arrays comprising metal, alloy, semiconductor and/or magnetic clusters. An &ldquo;array&rdquo; can be any arrangement of plural such clusters that is useful for forming electronic devices. Two primary examples of arrays are (1) electronic circuits, and (2) arrangements of computer memory elements, both of which can be in one or several planes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Clusters&rdquo; as used herein refers to more than one, and typically three or more, metal, alloy, semiconductor or magnetic atoms coupled to one another by metal-type bonds. Clusters are intermediate in size between single atoms and colloidal materials. Clusters made in accordance with the present invention also are referred to herein as &ldquo;nanoclusters.&rdquo; This indicates that the radius of each such cluster preferably is from about 0.7 to about 1.0 nm. A primary goal of the present invention is to provide electronic devices that operate at or about room temperature. This is possible if the cluster size is made small enough to meet Coulomb blockade charging energy requirements at room temperature. While cluster size itself is not dispositive of whether the clusters are useful for forming devices operable at or about room temperature, cluster size is nonetheless quite important. It currently is believed that clusters having radiuses much larger than the maximum value stated above likely will not be useful for forming electronic devices that operate at or about room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The metal, alloy, semiconductor and/or magnetic clusters are bonded to &ldquo;scaffolds&rdquo; to organize the clusters into arrays. &ldquo;Scaffolds&rdquo; are any molecules that can be placed on a substrate in predetermined patterns, such as linear bridges between electrodes, and to which clusters can be bonded to provide organized cluster arrays. Without limitation, a preferred group of scaffolds comprise biomolecules, such as polynucleotides, polypeptides, and mixtures thereof. Polypeptides are currently preferred molecules for forming scaffolds, and polypeptides capable of forming &agr; helices are particularly preferred scaffold-forming molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a method for forming arrays of metal, alloy, semiconductor and/or magnetic clusters first involves placing the scaffold on a substrate, most likely in a predetermined pattern. Arrays are formed by contacting the scaffold with plural, monodispersed (clusters of substantially the same size) ligand-stabilized metal, alloy, semiconductor and/or magnetic clusters. If the clusters are metal clusters, then the metal preferably is selected from the group consisting of Ag, Au, Pt, Pd and mixtures thereof. A currently preferred metal is gold, and a currently preferred metal cluster is Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Clusters generally are bonded to the scaffold by ligand exchange reactions. Each cluster, prior to contacting the scaffold, includes plural exchangeable ligands bonded thereto. The ligand-exchange reactions involve exchanging functional groups of the scaffold for at least one of the exchangeable ligands bonded to the cluster prior to contacting the scaffold with the clusters. Examples of exchangeable ligands suitable for forming metal clusters in accordance with the invention can be selected from the group consisting of thiols, thioethers (i.e., sulfides), thioesters, disulfides, sulfur-containing heterocycles, 1&deg;, 2&deg; and perhaps 3&deg; amines, pyridines, phosphines, carboxylates, nitrites, hydroxyl-bearing compounds, such as alcohols, and mixtures thereof. Thiols currently are preferred ligands for practicing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> There are several methods for placing the scaffold onto substrates in predetermined patterns. For example, a first method comprises aligning scaffold molecules in an electrical field created between electrodes on the substrate. It therefore will be appreciated that the scaffold molecules used must have sufficient dipoles to allow them to align between the electrodes. This is one reason why polypeptides that form &agr; helices are preferred. The &agr; helix imparts a sufficient dipole to the polypeptide molecules to allow alignment of the molecules between the electrodes upon formation of an electrical field. One example of a polypeptide useful for forming scaffolds in accordance with the present invention is polylysine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A second method comprises polymerizing monomers, oligomers (10 amino acids or nucleotides or less) or small polynucleotides or polypeptides into longer molecules on the surface of a substrate. For example, scaffold molecules can be polymerized as a bridge between electrodes on a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides compositions, one use for which is in the formation of metal and/or semiconductor arrays. A currently preferred embodiment of the composition comprises monodispersed, ligand-stabilized Au<highlight><subscript>55 </subscript></highlight>metal clusters bonded to a polypeptide in the shape of or capable of forming an a helix with the metal clusters bonded thereto. The metal clusters have metal-cluster radiuses of from about 0.7 nm to about 1.8 nm, and preferably from about 0.7 nm to about 1.0 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An object of this invention is to provide methods for fabricating one-, two-, and three-dimensional, scaffold-organized metal cluster arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An object of this invention is to provide high density electronic or memory devices that operate on the principle of Coulomb blockade at ambient temperatures. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The general steps used to produce organized arrays comprising metal, alloy, semiconductor and/or magnetic clusters in accordance with the present invention include (1) attaching molecular scaffolds to substrates in predetermined patterns, (2) forming monodispersed, relatively small (i.e., nanocluster size) ligand-stabilized metal, alloy, semiconductor and/or magnetic clusters, (3) coupling the ligand-stabilized clusters to the scaffolds to form organized arrays, (4) coupling electrical contacts to the organized arrays, and (5) using such constructs to form electronic, particulary nanoelectronic, devices. The substrate generally is a metal, glass or semiconductor material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Currently, most efforts have been directed to developing working devices using metal clusters. Certain of the following passages therefore focus on describing how to make and use devices based on metal cluster arrays. It should be understood, however, that any reference in this application to &ldquo;metal clusters&rdquo; or &ldquo;clusters&rdquo; typically also refers to alloy clusters, semiconductor clusters, magnetic clusters, and combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Important features of the present invention include the small physical size of the metal clusters, the ligand exchange chemistry and the nature of the ligand shell produced by the ligand exchange chemistry. The small physical size of the metal clusters provides a large Coulomb charging energy. The ligand-exchange chemistry provides a means to taylor the ligand shell for a particular purpose and immobilize the clusters on biomolecules. And, the ligand shell offers a uniform and chemically adjustable tunnel barrier between cluster cores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The following paragraphs describe the present invention in greater detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> I. Forming Monodispersed Ligand-Stabilized Clusters </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A feature of the present invention is the recognition that monodispersed, relatively small metal clusters can be used to develop electronic devices that operate at or about room temperature based on the Coulomb blockade effect. &ldquo;Monodispersed&rdquo; refers to the formation of a population of metal clusters of substantially the same size, i.e., having substantially the same radiuses (or diameters). In contrast, prior-art approaches typically have used polydispersed metal clusters where the size of the metal clusters is not substantially uniform. A completely monodispersed population is one in which the size of the metal clusters is identical. However, complete monodispersity is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. And complete monodispersity is not required to produce devices operating at room temperature based on the Coulomb blockade effect. Nevertheless, as the dispersity of the cluster population proceeds from absolute monodispersity towards polydispersity the likelihood that the device will operate reliably at room temperature based on the Coulomb blockade effect decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as the radius of the metal cluster decreases, the intrinsic capacitance gets smaller. As capacitance gets smaller, the charging energy of the cluster gets larger. Coulomb blockade effects are observed when the charging energy exceeds the thermal energy at room temperature. Prior approaches have used clusters having radiuses generally larger than would be useful for forming devices that operate at room temperature based on the Coulomb blockade effect. In contrast, the present invention forms metal &ldquo;nanoclusters&rdquo; having relatively small radiuses. The size requirement for clusters made in accordance with the present invention can be established in at least two ways, (1) by stating absolute radius lengths, and (2) by comparing the radius of the cluster in question to the radius of gold clusters made having magic numbers (see the discussion provided below) of gold atoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In terms of absolute numbers, &ldquo;nanocluster&rdquo; is defined herein as a cluster having a radius of from about 0.7 nm to about 1.8 nm (7 &angst; to about 18 &angst;), preferably from about 0.7 nm to about 1.25 nm (7 &angst; to about 12.5 &angst;), and even more preferably from about 0.7 nm to less than or equal to 1.0 nm (7 &angst; to less than or equal to 10 &angst;). These radius lengths refer solely to the radius of the metal cluster, and not the radius of the metal cluster and ligand sphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With its insulating ligand shell, the diameter of the ligand-stabilized metal cluster can vary. The size of the ligand shell may influence the electron tunneling rate between clusters. Tunneling rate is exponentially related to the thickness of the ligand shell. As a result, the diameter of the ligand shell may be tailored for a particular purpose. It currently is believed that the diameters for ligand-stabilized clusters useful for practicing the present invention should be from about 2.5 nm to about 5 nm. The relatively large metal clusters made previously do not provide a large Coulomb charging energy and do not operate at room temperature, and instead generally only operate at temperatures of from about 50 mK to about 10K. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Bare&rdquo; clusters, i.e., those without ligand shells, also may be useful for practicing the present invention. For example, bare clusters can be used to form electrical contacts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Still another consideration is the distance between the edges of metal cluster cores. It currently is believed that the maximum distance between the edges of cluster cores for clusters useful for practicing the present invention is about 5 nm (50 &angst;), and ideally is on the order of from about 1 to about 2 nm (10-20 &angst;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Originally it was believed that clusters in accordance with the present invention generally should include numbers of atoms that are based on the so-called &ldquo;geometric magic numbers&rdquo; of atoms surrounded by a ligand shell. Geometric magic numbers result from the most densely packed arrangement of atoms that form a &ldquo;sphere.&rdquo; Magic numbers are given by Formula 1 below

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> where k is an integer that represents the number of shells of metal atoms surrounding a central atom. Noble metal clusters with k&equals;2,4,6,7 and 8 have been synthesized and stabilized by a ligand shell. While clusters having magic numbers of atoms will work to practice the present invention, it has now been determined that magic numbers of atoms likely are not required to provide clusters useful for practicing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Solely by way of example, the most likely metals to be used to form ligand-stabilized metal clusters in accordance with the present invention can be selected from the group consisting of silver (Ag), gold (Au), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), and mixtures thereof. &ldquo;Mixtures thereof&rdquo; refers to having more than one type of metal cluster coupled to a particular scaffold, or different metal clusters bonded to different scaffolds used to form a particular electronic device. It also is possible that metal alloy clusters, e.g., gold/palladium clusters, can be used to form cluster arrays and electronic devices in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Gold is the currently preferred metal for forming ligand-stabilized monodispersed metal clusters. This is because (1) the ligand exchange chemistry for gold nanoclusters and the nature of the ligand shell formed about gold is well understood, (2) Au<highlight><subscript>55 </subscript></highlight>has a diameter of about 1.2 &mgr;m, which has proved ideal for forming organized metal arrays that exhibit the Coulomb effect at or about room temperature, and (3) it is possible to prepare nearly monodispersed gold clusters without lengthy purification requirements, such as lengthy crystallization processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Assuming that magic numbers do provide benefit, the magic numbers of gold, palladium and platinum atoms for use with the present invention are 13, 39, 55, 147 and 309. 55 is the currently preferred magic number (represented as AU<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>, Pd<highlight><subscript>55 </subscript></highlight>and Pt<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>). The magic number of silver atoms for silver metal clusters useful for practicing the present invention likely are the same as for gold, but this has not yet been verified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor materials also likely are useful for practicing the present invention. Likely semiconductor materials that can be made into nanoclusters and stabilized with ligand spheres include, without limitation, cadmium selenide, zinc selenide, cadmium sulfide, cadmium tellurite, cadmium-mercury-tellurite, zinc tellurite, gallium arsenide, indium arsenide and lead sulfide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Magnetic particles also can be used to decorate scaffolds in accordance with the present invention. An example, without limitation, of such magnetic particles is iron oxide (Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Once a suitable metal, alloy, semiconductor and/or magnetic material is selected for forming nanoclusters, ligands for bonding to the clusters also must be selected. The assembly of clusters into Coulomb blockade structures requires molecular-scale organization of the clusters while simultaneously maintaining the insulating ligand sphere between individual clusters. The clusters also must be coupled to the scaffold in a sufficiently robust manner to allow for fabrication of devices incorporating cluster arrays. This can be accomplished by ligand exchange reactions. The selection of ligands for forming an insulating ligand layer about the cluster and for undergoing ligand exchange reactions therefore is an important consideration. A list of criteria useful for selecting appropriate ligands includes, but may not be limited to, (1) the ligands should be capable of undergoing reactions with the scaffold, such as ligand-exchange, acid-base or intercelation reactions (2) the ligands preferably increase the solubility of the ligand-metal cluster complexes in organic solvents, which helps synthesize metal clusters and perform subsequent reactions, and (3) the ligands selected preferably form well ordered metal-ligand complexes having diameters as stated above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">B. Classes of Ligands </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Ligands deemed most suitable for forming metal clusters in accordance with the present invention can be selected, without limitation, from the group consisting of: thiols (RSH); thioethers (also known as sulfides, R&mdash;S&mdash;R&prime;); thioesters (R&mdash;S<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>H); disulfides (R&mdash;S&mdash;S&mdash;R&prime;); sulfur-containing heterocycles, such as thiophene; 1&deg;, 2&deg; and perhaps 3&deg; amines (RNH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NH and R<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N, respectively), particularly 1&deg; amines; pyridines; phosphines (R<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P); carboxylates (RCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash;); nitrites (RCN); hydroxyl-bearing compounds, such as alcohols (ROH); and mixtures thereof. Additional guidance concerning the selection of ligands can be obtained from Michael Natan et al.&apos;s <highlight><italic>Preparation and Characterization of Au Colloid Monolayers, Anal. Chem., </italic></highlight>67:735-743 (1995), which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Organic sulfur-containing molecules (e.g., thiols, thioethers, thioesters, disulfides, sulfur-containing heterocycles, and mixtures thereof) currently are the preferred class of ligands. Thiols are the currently preferred type of sulfur-containing ligand for several reasons. For example, thiols have an affinity for gold, which often is formed into electrodes or electrode patterns. Moreover, thiols have been shown to be good ligands for stabilizing gold clusters. And, many thiol-based ligands are commercially available. The thiols form ligand-stabilized metal clusters having a formula M<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>(SR)<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>wherein M is a metal, R is an alkyl chain or aromatic group, x is a number of metal atoms that provide metal clusters having the characteristics described above, and n is the number of thiol ligands attached to the ligand-stabilized metal clusters. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">C. Organic Portion of Ligands </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The organic portion of ligands useful for practicing the present invention also can vary. For example, the length of the alkyl chain can be varied to obtain particular features desired in the ligand-stabilized metal clusters. These include the solubility of the metal clusters in solvents used to carry out the present invention and the size and insulating characteristics of the ligand-stabilized metal clusters. Currently, alkyl chains having from about 2 carbon atoms to about 20 carbon atoms are deemed most suitable for practicing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Aryl-type ligands, i.e., aromatic groups such as phenyl rings, containing or having sulfur atoms coupled thereto also have been used as ligands for forming ligand-stabilized metal clusters. For example, mercaptobiphenyl (HS-phenyl-phenyl) has been used to form ligand-stabilized gold clusters. The aromatic rings of such compounds likely will be functionalized to include functional groups capable of reacting with the scaffold molecules. For example, the aromatic rings might include acidic groups, such as carboxylic acids, for acid-base reactions with functional groups of the scaffold molecules, such as amines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Aromatic ligands are quite useful for producing rigid arrays, which helps stabilize the electron transport properties. For this reason, aryl ligands currently are considered preferred ligands for practicing the present invention. But, small alkyl groups, such as thioproprionic acid, also provide rigid ligand systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Ligands that intercalate into DNA also can be used. This allows a means for attaching the metal clusters to DNA molecules. Typically, the DNA intercalating ligands include rigid &pgr; r systems. Examples of such DNA intercalating ligands include, without limitation, anthraquinone and phenanthridinium derivatives. The DNA intercalating ligands also can be made DNA-sequence dependent. Thus, DNA having particular sequences can be used as a scaffold that is intercelated at predetermined portions of the scaffold. This provides a method for designing the spacing between metal clusters. The intercalating ligands also can be photocrosslinked to provide a more rigid system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">D. General Method for Producing Ligand-Stabilized Metal Clusters </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The general approach to making ligand-stabilized metal clusters first comprises forming monodispersed metal clusters having displaceable ligands. This can be accomplished by directly forming monodispersed metal clusters having the appropriate ligands attached thereto, but is more likely accomplished by first forming monodispersed, ligand-stabilized metal clusters which act as precursors for subsequent ligand-exchange reactions with ligands deemed more useful for practicing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> One example, without limitation, of a monodispersed gold cluster that has been produced and which is useful for subsequent ligand-exchange reactions with the ligands listed above is Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>&lsqb;P(C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>.

Svn., </italic></highlight>27:214-218 (1990). Schmid&apos;s publication is incorporated herein by reference. Schmid&apos;s synthesis involves the reduction of AuCl&lsqb;Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. Example 1 below also discusses the synthesis of Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>&lsqb;P(C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. One advantage or Schmid&apos;s synthesis is the relatively small size distribution of clusters produced by the method, e.g., 1.4&plusmn;0.4 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Once ligand-stabilized monodispersed metal clusters are obtained, such clusters can be used for subsequent ligand-exchange reactions, as long as the ligand-exchange reaction is readily facile and produces monodispersed metal clusters. Prior to the present invention it was not appreciated that the AU<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>&lsqb;P(C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>clusters could be used to form nearly monodispersed derivatives by ligand-exchange chemistry. In fact, some literature reports indicated that it was difficult, if not impossible, to form linked metal clusters by ligand-exchange reactions. See, for example, Andres et al.&apos;s <highlight><italic>Self</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Assembly of a Two</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Dimensional Supperlattice of Molecularly Linked Metal Clusters, Science, </italic></highlight>273:1690-1693 (1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> To perform ligand-exchange reactions, a reaction mixture is formed comprising the metal cluster having exchangeable ligands attached thereto and the ligands to be attached to the metal cluster, such as thiols. A precipitate generally forms upon solvent removal, and this precipitate is then isolated by conventional techniques. See, Examples 2 and 3 for further details concerning the synthesis of ligand-stabilized metals. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">A. Background </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Metal clusters produced as stated above are coupled to molecular scaffolds. &ldquo;Coupling&rdquo; as used herein refers to some interaction between the scaffold and the ligand-stabilized metal clusters such that the metal clusters become associated with the scaffold. Associated may mean covalently bound, but also can include other molecular associations, such as electrostatic interactions. &ldquo;Coupling&rdquo; most typically refers to attaching clusters to the scaffolds by either (1) ligand exchange reactions where functional groups of the scaffold molecules, such as sulfur-containing functional groups or amines, exchange with ligands forming the metal-ligand complex, (2) acid-base type reactions between the ligands and molecules of the scaffold, or (3) intercelation of a ligand into a DNA helix. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">B. Scaffolds Comprising Biomolecules </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To form useful devices, the scaffolds must be disposed on a substrate in predetermined patterns to which electric contacts can be made. The scaffolds of the present invention can comprise biomolecules, such as polynucleotides, polypeptides and mixtures thereof, and hence are most appropriately referred to as biomolecular scaffolds. There is some precedent for using polynucleotides for forming molecular scaffolds. See, for example, C.A. Mirkin et al&apos;s A <highlight><italic>DNA</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Based Method for Rationally Assembling Nanoparticles into Macroscopic Materials</italic></highlight>, Nature, 382:607 (1996); and A. P. Alivisatos et al.&apos;s <highlight><italic>Organization of &lsquo;Nanocrystal Molecules&rsquo; using DNA</italic></highlight>, Nature, 382:609 (1996). Each of these references is incorporated herein by reference. Polynucleotides provide a different spacing between metal clusters than do polypeptides. Thus, spacing between metal clusters can be varied by changing the nature of the scaffold. Polypeptides may provide the best spacing for the formation of electronic devices operating at room temperature based on the Coulomb blockade effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Preferred polypeptides are those polypeptides that form &agr; helical secondary structures. Certain peptides, although attractive candidates from the standpoint of being stabilizing ligands for the metal clusters, do not form a helices. However, many polypeptides do form &agr; helices, and hence are good candidates for forming scaffolds in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> It also should be appreciated that the polypeptide can be a &ldquo;homopolypeptide,&rdquo; defined herein to refer to polypeptides having only one type of amino acid. One example of a homopolypeptide is poly-L-lysine. The free base form of polylysine readily forms an &agr; helix. Moreover, lysine provides a terminal amino group that is oriented favorably in the &agr; helix for ligand exchange reactions with the ligand-stabilized metal clusters. Homopolypeptides generally have been used in the practice of the present invention for several reasons. First, certain homopolypeptides are commercially available, such as polylysine. Second, homopolypeptides provide more predictable &agr; helix formation with the side chains oriented outwardly from the &agr; helix at known, predictable distances. This allows the polypeptide to be designed for a particular purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The peptide also may be a &ldquo;heteropolypeptide&rdquo; (having two or more amino acids), or block copolymer-type polypeptides (formed from plural different amino acids with identical amino acids being organized in blocks in the amino acid sequence), as long as such peptides (1) form &agr; helices, and (2) provide functional groups positioned and capable of engaging in ligand exchange reactions with the monodispersed metal clusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Most amino acids can be used to form suitable homo- or heteropolypeptides. Examples of particularly suitable amino acids include, but are not limited to, naturally occurring amino acids such as arginine, tyrosine, and methionine; and nonnaturally occurring amino acids such as homolysine and homocysteine. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">IV Placing Scaffolds on Substrates </heading>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">A. General Discussion </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The scaffold simply may be placed on the surface of the substrate, in contrast to more tightly adhering the polypeptide to the substrate such as through electrostatic or covalent bonds. As used herein, the term &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; refers to any material, or combination of materials, that might be used to form electronic devices. For example, the substrate might be selected from the group consisting of silicon, silicon nitride, ultraflat glass, metals, and combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Simply placing the scaffold on the surface without considering whether to electrostatically or covalently bind the scaffold to the substrate simplifies the process for making working devices. Placing the scaffold on the surface of the substrate can be accomplished by (1) forming solutions containing the molecular scaffold, (2) placing the solution containing the scaffold onto a substrate, such as by spin coating the solution onto a substrate, and (3) allowing the solvent to evaporate, thereby depositing the solid molecular scaffold onto the substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> If simple deposition of the scaffold onto the substrate does not produce a sufficiently robust device, then the scaffold might be more tightly coupled to the substrate. One method for accomplishing this is to use compounds that act as adhesives or tethers between the substrate and the molecular scaffold. Which compounds to use as adhesives or tethers depends on the nature of the substrate and the metal cluster. For example, amino-silane reagents may be used to attach molecular scaffolds to the substrate. The silane functional group allows the tether to be coupled to a silicon, glass or gold substrate. This provides a tether having a terminal amino group that can be used to react with the scaffold to tether the scaffold to the substrate. The terminal amino group also can be used as an initiation site for the in situ polymerization of polypeptides using activated amino acids. Another class of tethers particularly useful for attaching polylysine to substrates is the &ohgr;-carboxyalkanethiols (<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>C&mdash;R&mdash;SH). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">B. Organization of Scaffolds on Substrates </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> There are at least four methods for forming organized molecular arrays, particularly linear arrays, on the surface of substrates. The first comprises depositing dilute solutions of scaffold molecules onto substrates. The second comprises aligning &agr;-helical polypeptides between electrodes. The third comprises growing polypeptide chains between two or more electrodes beginning from an initiation site placed on an electrode. And the fourth comprises forming DNA scaffolds between electrodes. Each of these approaches is discussed below. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">1. Deposition from Dilute Solutions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> First, isolated molecular scaffolds can be prepared by depositing highly dilute solutions onto substrate surfaces. Alternatively, this can be accomplished by dilution of the molecular scaffold film with an inert, &agr;-helix polypeptide such as poly-&ggr;-benzyl-L-glutamate. See, Poly(&ggr;-<highlight><italic>Benzyl</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Glutamate</italic></highlight>) <highlight><italic>and Other Glutamic Acid Containing Polymers</italic></highlight>, H. Block (Gordon &amp; Breach, NY) 1983. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">2. Aligning Polypeptides in a High Electrical Field </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The second, and likely most practical method, for providing a scaffold on a substrate is to align a polypeptide &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; in an electrical field produced between two electrodes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates saw tooth electrodes 10 comprising electrodes 12-20 that are placed on a substrate by conventional methods, such as electron-beam lithography, thermal evaporation, or lift-off techniques. A solution comprising the scaffold molecules is first formed and then applied to the surface of the substrate having the electrode pattern placed thereon, such as a substrate having the electrode pattern of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. &agr;-Helical polypeptides self-align (pole) in the presence of an applied magnetic field or electrical field (typically 20 Vcm<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>). See, S. Itou&apos;s <highlight><italic>Reorientation of Poly</italic></highlight>-&ggr;-<highlight><italic>benzyl</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>L</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>glutamate Liquid Crystals in an Electric Field, Jpn J. Apl. Phys., </italic></highlight>24:1234 (1985). Presumably this is due to their large diamagnetic anisotropy. See, C. T. O&apos;Konski et al.&apos;s <highlight><italic>Electric Properties of Macromolecules IV Determination of Electric and Optical Parameters From Saturation of Electric Birefringence in Solutions, J. Phys. Chem., </italic></highlight>63:1558 (1959). An electric field is generated between the electrodes, such as the points of the saw tooth illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This local field between the two points causes the scaffold to align between the points. The solvent is evaporated to provide scaffolds oriented between the electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Based on the above, it will be apparent that the dipole moment of the scaffold influences whether the polypeptide can be oriented between the two electrodes, and the efficiency of the orientation. This is one reason why &agr; helical polypeptides are a currently preferred polypeptides for forming scaffolds. The hydrogen bonds formed in the &agr; helix all orient in the same direction, thereby imparting a dipole to the secondary &agr; helical structure. It currently is believed that the dipole is primarily the result of the &agr; helix, and not the side chains. As a result, preferred polypeptides for practicing the present invention are those that form &agr; helices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">3. Growing Polypeptides Between Electrodes </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In some instances, it may be desirable to use scaffolds to bridge directly between two electrical contacts of interest. This can be accomplished by first placing initiating sites on the electrodes, and then &ldquo;growing&rdquo; polypeptides between the initiation sites on the electrodes to form a bridge. One example of how this would be accomplished is to attach a tether to an electrode, the tether having a pendant functional group that is capable of forming peptide bonds when reacted with an activated amino acid. The most likely pendant functional group for this purpose is a 1&deg; amine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> To provide a specific example to illustrate the procedure, a tether comprising an alkyl chain having both a terminal amino group and a terminal sulfhydryl group (i.e., an amino-thiol, HS&mdash;-R&mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is reacted with a gold electrode using conventional chemistry. This covalently attaches the sulfhydryl group of the tether to the metal (i.e., Au&mdash;S&mdash;R&mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The terminal amino group is then used to initiate polymerization of a polypeptide using activated amino acids, perhaps in the presence of an applied field, between the two electrodes. The polymerization is accomplished by supplying activated amino acids for reaction with the primary amine in a chain-growing reaction which serially couples amino acids to the end of the growing chain and regenerates the primary amine for subsequent reaction with another activated amino acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Activated amino acids are commercially available and are described in the literature. One example, without limitation, of an activated amino acid for formation of peptide bonds in this manner is N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) amino acids. NCA amino acids react with surface-bound initiator sites (e.g., the primary amino groups) to begin a ring-opening polymerization of the NCA-amino acid. See, J. K. Whitesell et al&apos;s <highlight><italic>Directionally Aligned Helical Peptides on Surfaces, </italic></highlight>Science, 261:73 (1993). Whitesell&apos;s publication is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> When NCA polymerization is performed under the influence of an electric field applied between two electrodes it is possible to &ldquo;grow&rdquo; the polypeptide scaffolds from one electrode to the other. One specific example of an NCA amino acid that can be used for this purpose is that derived from N<highlight><subscript>&egr;</subscript></highlight>-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine. The amino acid side chains of this compound can be deprotected using trimethylsilyl iodide. Deprotection yields the poly-L-lysine scaffold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Working embodiments of the present invention generally have used polylysine as the polypeptide useful for forming the molecular scaffold. Polylysine was chosen because it includes a hydrocarbon chain that extends the amino functional group, which can undergo ligand-displacement reactions with the ligand-stabilized metal cluster, out and away from the polypeptide backbone. Thus, two important criteria for selecting polypeptides for use as molecular scaffolds are (1) does the polypeptide form &agr; helices, and (2) do the amino acid side chains provide functional groups that are metal-cluster stabilizing and capable of undergoing ligand-exchange reactions with the ligand-stabilized metal clusters. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">4. Forming Polynucleotide Scaffolds </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Methods for providing polynucleotide scaffolds also recently have been discovered. See, for example, (1) E. Braun et al., <highlight><italic>DNA Templated Assembly and Electrode Attachment of a Conducting Silver Wire</italic></highlight>,&rdquo; Nature, p. 775 (1998); (2) N. Seeman, &ldquo;<highlight><italic>DNA Components for Molecular Architecture</italic></highlight>,&rdquo; Accounts of Chemical Research, 30:357 (1997); Qi J., et al. &ldquo;<highlight><italic>Ligation of Triangles Built from Bulged </italic></highlight>3-<highlight><italic>Arm DNA Branched Junctions</italic></highlight>,&rdquo; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 118:6121 (1996); and C. Niemeyer et al. &ldquo;<highlight><italic>DNA as a Material for Nanotechnology</italic></highlight>,&rdquo; Angewandte Chemie, International Edition in English, 36:585 (1997). Each of these references is incorporated herein by reference. The Braun reference provides a method for positioning a DNA molecule between electrodes spaced by a particular distance, such as about 10 &mgr;m. Double stranded DNA, with single stranded sticky ends, and a pair of electrodes that have single stranded DNA attached thereto that is complementary to the sequence of the sticky ends of the DNA are prepared. Annealing the sticky ends to the single-stranded primers allows coupling of double stranded DNA between two electrodes spaced by a known distance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">V. Decorating Scaffolds With Metal Clusters </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> To provide working electronic devices, clusters must be coupled to the scaffolds. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> provides a schematic representation of a poly-L-lysine that is &ldquo;decorated&rdquo; with metal clusters, i.e., the clusters are coupled to the scaffold. A first consideration is whether to decorate the scaffold with clusters prior to or subsequent to placing the scaffold onto a substrate. Although both of these approaches work, there are some disadvantages with decorating the scaffold with the clusters prior to placing the scaffold on the substrate. This approach places clusters on all surfaces of the polypeptide, even those that come into contact with the underlying substrate. This is undesirable for several reasons. For example, such placement of the clusters might interfere with fixing the decorated scaffold to the substrate. And, it places clusters in locations in which they are not needed, and hence uses more valuable monodispersed clusters than needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Based on the above, a method which first places the scaffolds onto a substrate, and subsequently decorates the scaffold with clusters is a currently preferred approach. This can be accomplished by first forming a solution comprising the ligand-stabilized monodispersed clusters using a solvent that does not dissolve the scaffold. Candidate solvents for this purpose include, without limitation, dichloromethane and hexanes. The ligand-stabilized clusters are then introduced onto the scaffold and allowed to undergo reactions with the scaffold molecules, such as ligand-exchange or acid-base type reactions, thereby coupling the ligand-stabilized clusters to the scaffold. See, Example 4 for further details concerning decorating scaffolds with clusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The present approach to producing decorated scaffolds also allows for good lateral definition, which is a key feature of the present invention. &ldquo;Lateral definition&rdquo; refers to the width of an array. Prior to the present invention, the state of technology was capable of producing lines having a width of about 300A. With the present invention, lateral resolution is much improved, and is on the order of about 10 &angst;. In addition, branched polypeptides offer the possibility of introducing control electrodes and interconnects at the molecular level. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">VI. Ultrafast, Ultrahigh Density Switching Devices </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> This section discusses the steps required to use the decorated molecular scaffolds of the present invention to produce ultrafast, ultrahigh density switching devices. First, a substrate is selected and cleaned. One example of a substrate is a silicon nitride chip or wafer. On top of this substrate would be placed electrical contacts. This could be accomplished using known technologies, such as lithography or thermal evaporation of a metal, such as gold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Once a substrate is obtained having the electrical contacts placed thereon, a scaffold is then placed on the surface using the techniques described above. Thereafter, the substrate with scaffold is treated with monodispersed, ligand-stabilized clusters to attach such clusters to the scaffold. The organization of scaffold likely determines the particular device being made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> For a switching device, analogous to a transistor, saw tooth electrical contacts, such as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, are deposited onto a substrate and a scaffold then oriented therebetween. This provides two arms of a transistor. A capacitance contact required to provide the third arm of a transistor is imbedded in the substrate underneath the molecular scaffold. Direct electrical contact with this &ldquo;gate&rdquo; imbedded in the substrate is not actually required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a third contact arm could be incorporated into the template. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic representation of a scaffold useful for this purpose. For example, a polypeptide of a particular length, e.g., a 25-mer or 50-mer, could first be coupled to an electrode. A branching portion of the scaffold could then be attached, thereby forming an electrical arm, or plural such arms, for further providing single or multiple gate electrodes to the template. The scaffold is then coupled between two electrodes subsequent to the formation of this contact arm, or arms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention can be used to form a variety of standard circuit components to implement Boolean logic functions. These circuit components include, but are not limited to, AND, NAND, NOR, OR and Exclusive OR gates. Additionally, multiplexers and muliplexer-based circuits can be created and used to implement Boolean logic functions. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> This example describes the synthesis of AU<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(SC<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>37</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>26</subscript></highlight>. Dichloromethane (&ap;10 ml), AU<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(20.9 mg) and octadecylthiol (23.0 mg) were combined in a 25 ml round bottom. A black solution was produced, and this solution was stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 36 hours. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure and replaced with acetone. This resulted in the formation of a black powder suspension. The solid was then isolated by vacuum filtration and washed with acetone (10&times;5 ml). After the final wash, the solid was redissolved in hot benzene. The benzene was removed under reduced pressure with gentle heating to yield a dark brown solid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The solid material was then subjected to UV-VIS (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 230-800 nm), <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>HNMR (133 MHz), <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>CNMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force spectroscopy. These analytical tools were used to characterize the structure of the compound produced, and such analysis indicated that the structure of the metal-ligand complex was Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(SC<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>37</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>26</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data also was collected concerning Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(SC<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>37</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>26</subscript></highlight>. This involved irradiating molecules with high-energy photons of fixed energy. When the energy of the photons is greater than the ionization potential of an electron, the compound may eject the electron, and the kinetic energy of the electron is equal to the difference between the energy of the photons and the ionization potential. The photoelectron spectrum has sharp peaks at energies usually associated with ionization of electrons from particular orbitals. X-ray radiation generally is used to eject core electrons from materials being analyzed. Clifford E. Dykstra&apos;s <highlight><italic>Quantum Chemistry </italic></highlight>&amp; <highlight><italic>Molecular Spectroscopy</italic></highlight>, pp. 296-295 (Prentice Hall, 1992). Quantification of the data provided by XPS analysis of Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(SC<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>37</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>26 </subscript></highlight>made according to this example showed that Au 4f comprised about 67.38% and S 2p constituted about 28.01% &plus;4.17%, which suggests a formula of Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(SC<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>37</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>26</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Quantification of XPS spectra gave a gold-to-sulfur ratio of about 2.3:1.0 and shows a complete absence of phosphorus or chlorine. As with AU<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(pPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, a broad doublet is observed for the Au 4f level. The binding energy of the Au 4f 7/2 level is about 84.0-84.2 eV versus that of adventitious carbon, 284.8 eV. This indicates absence of Au(I) and is similar to binding energies obtained for clusters such as AU<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. The binding energy of the S 2p 312 peak ranges from 162.4 to 162.6 eV for the series of clusters. These values are shifted to lower energy than those found for free thiols (163.3-163.9 eV) and are close to the values reported for thiolates bound to gold (162.0-162.4 eV). The possibility that unattached thiols may be present in the sample is unambiguously ruled out by <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H and <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C NMR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Thermal gravimetric analysis confirms the Au:S ratio obtained from XPS. On heating to 600&deg; C., ODT-stabilized clusters display a 40% mass loss, corresponding to 26 ODT ligands on an assumed 55-atom gold cluster. This ratio alludes to the retention of a small cluster size. A sample of the larger hexadecanethiol-stabilized gold cluster has been shown to give a 33.5% mass loss, corresponding to from about 95 to about 126 ligands per cluster (diameter&equals;2.4 nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Optical spectra of gold colloids and clusters exhibit a size-dependent surface plasmon resonance band at about 520 nm (See. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). In absorption spectra of ligand-exchanged clusters produced as stated in this example, the interband transition typically observed for small clusters including AU<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>was observed. Little or no plasmon resonance was observed, consistent with a cluster size of about 1.7 nm or less. For the ODT-passivated cluster, no plasmon resonance was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Quantitative size information can be obtained using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The core size obtained from TEM images of the ODT-stabilized cluster (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is found to be 1.7&plusmn;0.5 nm and is in good agreement with that obtained from atomic force microscope images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Atomic force microscopy (AFM) also was performed on the AU<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(SC<highlight><subscript>18</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>37</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>26 </subscript></highlight>produced according to this example. The analysis produced a topographical representation of the metal complex. AFM probes the surface of a sample with a sharp tip located at the free end of a cantilever. Forces between the tip and the sample surface cause the cantilever to bend or deflect. The measured cantilever deflections allow a computer to generate a map of surface topography. Rebecca Howland et al&apos;s <highlight><italic>A Practical Guide to Scanning Probe Microscopy, </italic></highlight>p. 5, (Park Scientific Instruments, 1993). The AFM data showed heights of 1.5 nm for single clusters and aggregates subjected to high force. This corresponds to the size of the gold core clusters. This helped establish that the gold clusters of this example were close to the correct size for forming devices in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> This example describes the synthesis of Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(SPh-Ph)<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>. Dichloromethane (&ap;10 ml), Au(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(25.2 mg) and 4-mercaptobiphenyl (9.60 mg) were combined in a 25 ml round bottom. A black solution was produced, and this solution was stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 36 hours. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and replaced with acetone. This resulted in the formation of a black powder suspension. The solid was isolated by vacuum filtration and washed with acetone (6&times;5 ml). The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure to yield 16.8 mg of a dark brown solid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The solid material was subjected to UV-VIS (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 230-800 nm), <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>HNMR (133 MHz), <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>CNMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force spectroscopy as in Example 2. This data confirmed the structure and purity of the metal complex, and further showed complete ligand exchange. For example, quantification of the XPS data made according to this example showed that Au 4f comprised about 71.02% and S 2p constituted about 28.98%, which suggests a formula of Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(S-biphenyl)<highlight><subscript>25</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> AFM analysis showed isolated metal clusters having measuring about 2.5 nm which correlates to the expected size of the gold core with a slightly extended sphere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Thiol-stabilized clusters as produced above display remarkable stability relative to Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, which undergoes decomposition in solution at room temperature to give bulk gold and AuCl&lsqb;PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;. No decomposition for the thiol-stabilized clusters was observed, despite the fact that some samples were deliberately stored in solution for weeks. In other tests, the mercaptobiphenyl and octadecylthiol-stabilized clusters (in the absence of free thiol) were heated to 75&deg; C. for periods of more than 9 hours in dilute 1,2-dichloroethane solution with no resultant degradation. Under identical conditions, Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>(PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is observed to decompose to Au(O) and AuCl&lsqb;PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rsqb; within 2 hours. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates that polypeptide molecular templates can be used to organize small, monodisperse nanoclusters into linear arrays of molecular dimension. A 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>M solution of poly-L-lysine is mixed with a large excess (1,000-fold) of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; gold 55 in methanol solution. The amino sidechains of the poly-L-lysine replace some of the labile triphenylphosphine ligands on the gold cluster and thus bind the cluster to the template. The decorated clusters precipitate out of solution onto a TEM grid. Single gold clusters that become non-specifically adsorbed on the grid will be removed by rinsing with benzene. Transmission electron micrography (TEM) analysis will show the gold cores of the cluster and will indicate the extent to which the cluster have aggregated into low-dimensional arrays due to template-induced organization. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> This example describes the electron transfer properties of organometallic structures formed by electron-beam irradiation of Au<highlight><subscript>55</subscript></highlight>&lsqb;P(C<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. This compound was produced as stated above in Example 1. A solution of the gold cluster was made by dissolving 22 mg of the solid in 0.25 mL of CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 0.25 mL of CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>ClCH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl. A supernatant solution was spin coated onto a Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>coated Si wafer at 1500 rpm for 25 seconds immediately after preparation. The film was patterned by exposure to a 40 kV electron beam at a line dosage of 100 nC/cm. The areas of the film exposed to the electron beam adhered to the surface and a CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>rinse removed the excess film. This procedure produced well defined structures. See, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. These structures appeared to be smooth and continuous under SEM inspection. Attempts were made to pattern the material using 254 nm UV lithography, but it was found to be insensitive to this wavelength. The defined structures had dimensions as small as 0.1 &mgr;m and AFM inspection measured the film thickness to be 50 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The organometallic samples were spin-coated with PMMA which was electron-beam exposed and developed to define contact regions. Contacts were fabricated using thermal evaporation of 100 nm of gold and conventional liftoff procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> DC current-voltage (I-V) measurements of several samples were taken. A shielded chamber, submerged in an oil bath, contained the sample mounted on a clean teflon stage. Rigid triaxial connections were used to connect the sample to a constant DC voltage source and electrometer. The oil bath temperature was controlled from 195 to 350K. Thermal equilibrium was achieved with a 10 Torr partial pressure of He in the chamber. Before electrical measurements the chamber was evacuated to a pressure &ap;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>Torr. The data showed little temperature drift over a typical four hour measurement sweep. The intrinsic leakage current of the system was measured using a control sample which had the same substrate and contact pad arrangement as the actual samples, but did not have the organometallic between the pads. At room temperature, the leakage current was almost linearly dependent on bias over the range &minus;100 to 100V, and had a maximum value &lE;100 fA. While the ultimate resolution of the current measurement was 10 fA, the leakage current set the miN/Mum resolved conductance &ap;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;15</superscript></highlight>&OHgr;<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. Constant amplitude RF signals with frequencies, f, from 0.1 to 5 MHz, were applied to the samples through a dipole antenna at 195K. No attempt was made to optimize the coupling between the RF signal and the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Without RF, the I-V characteristics for one sample at several temperatures are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. As the temperature was reduced, the low voltage portion of the curve flattened out and the current became indistinguishable from the leakage current. Above an applied voltage magnitude of 6.7&plusmn;0.6 V, the current increased abruptly. The data illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> establishes that the monodispersed gold clusters can produce devices that operate on the basis of the Coulomb blockage effect. This can be determined from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> because one of the curves has zero slope, indicating no current at the applied voltage, i.e., the cluster is blockaded at the particular temperature tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The application of the RF signal introduced steps in the I-V characteristic, as shown in the inset to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> establishes that an applied external varying signal (the frequency of which is provided by the X axis) actually controls the rate at which electrons move through metal clusters made in accordance with the present invention. The current at which these steps occurred was found to be proportional to the applied signal frequency, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. A least squares analysis of the linear current-frequency relationship for the highest current step shown gives a slope 1.59&plusmn;0.04&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;19 </superscript></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The introduction of plateaus in the patterned sample I-V characteristics is similar to the RF response reported in other Coulomb blockade systems. This effect has been attributed to phase locking of single electron tunneling events by the external RF signal. When the nth harmonic of the applied frequency corresponds to the mth harmonic of the frequency of tunneling in the system, mIle, the current becomes locked to a value I&equals;(n/m)ef. The results obtained suggest that correlated tunneling is present in the samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The patterned samples had stable I-V characteristics with time and temperature. Furthermore, as the temperature was raised above about 250K the I-V characteristics developed almost linear behavior up to VT. The conductance below V<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>was activated, with activation energies EA in the range 30-70 meV. One method to estimate the charging energy from the activation energy is to use the argument that the charging energy for one island in a infinite two-dimensional array, E<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>&ap;4E<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>. Assuming current suppression requires E<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&gt;10 kT, the sample with the largest activation energy should develop a Coulomb gap below &tilde;300 K. This value is within a factor of 2 of the measured temperature at which clear blockade behavior occurs in the patterned samples. Given the accuracy to which E<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>is known, the temperature dependence of the conductance within the Coulomb gap is consistent with the observation of blockade behavior. Using this value of E<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, the effective capacitance of a metal core in the patterned array is 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;19</superscript></highlight>&lt;C&lt;7&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;19</superscript></highlight>F. These values are close, but larger than the classical geometric capacitance of an isolated Au<highlight><subscript>55 </subscript></highlight>cluster C&equals;4&pgr;&egr;&egr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>r&ap;2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;19</superscript></highlight>F, where the dielectric constant of the surrounding ligand shell E is expected to be &tilde;3. The agreement between the two estimates of capacitance supports the notion that the current suppression in the metal cluster arrays is due to charging of individual AU<highlight><subscript>55 </subscript></highlight>clusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The non-linear I-V characteristic is similar to that of either a forward biased diode or one-/two-dimensional arrays of ultra small metal islands or tunnel junctions. However, the dependence of the I-V characteristic on the applied RF signal is not consistent with straightforward diode behavior. Therefore, the data has been analyzed in the context of an array of ultra small metal islands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Several reports have discussed the transport in ordered arrays of tunnel junctions that have tunneling resistances greater than the quantum resistance h/e<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and a charging energy significantly above the thermal energy. In this case Coulomb blockade effects introduce a threshold voltage below which current through the array is suppressed. As the applied voltage is increased well beyond threshold, the current-voltage characteristic approaches a linear asymptote with a slope related to the tunnel resistance. With the same temperature and tunnel resistance constraints, Middleton and Wingreen have discussed one- and two-dimensional arrays of maximally disordered normal metal islands where disorder is introduced as random offset charges on each dot. These authors predict current suppression below a threshold voltage and high bias current I&tilde;(V/V<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&minus;1)<highlight><superscript>&ggr;</superscript></highlight>. Here, the threshold voltage V<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>scales with the number of junctions N along the current direction. Analytically &ggr;&equals;1 for one-dimensional systems and 5/3 for infinite two-dimensional systems. Numerical simulations of a finite two-dimensional array gave &ggr;&equals;2.0&plusmn;0.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> While no effort was made to order samples, the data was analyzed using both the ordered and the disordered models. The only consistent analysis was found to be given by the disordered model. In particular, the high bias data did not have the linear asymptote predicted for an ordered system, but did scale as expected for a disordered system, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> also shows that a two-dimensional array so that sample is propagating through the sample tested along plural parallel paths. Such an arrangement is important for developing memory storage devices. The exponent &ggr;&ap;1.6 which is closest to the analytical prediction for an infinite, disordered two-dimensional array. From the analysis the magnitude of V<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&tilde;6&plusmn;1 V which is in good agreement with that estimated directly from the I-V data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The introduction of steps in the I-V characteristics by a RF field is similar to the RF response reported in other systems. This effect has been attributed to phase locking of single electron tunneling events by the external RF signal. If the applied frequency corresponds to a rational fraction multiple of the frequency of tunneling in the system, I/e, then the current is locked to a value I&equals;(n/m)ef, where n and m are integers. Therefore, the linear relationships shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> between f and I suggests that correlated tunneling is present in the samples. The lowest slope observed is best described with n/m&equals;1/5. For frequencies up to 3 MHz, the current resolution is insufficient to distinguish between the &frac15; and &frac14; harmonics. However, at higher frequencies where it should have been possible to distinguish between &frac15; and &frac14;, the &frac14; step was not observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> At temperatures above about 250K, the I-V characteristic was almost linear up to V<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>. In this regime the conductance was activated, with activation energies E<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>in the range 30 to 70 meV for the samples studied. Similar activated behavior has been reported for tunnel junction systems. It was argued that for an infinite 2D array the charging energy for one island E<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>&ap;4E<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>. Applying this argument to the present system, and assuming current suppression requires E<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>&gE;10 kT, the sample with the largest activation energy should develop a Coulomb gap below about 300 K. This estimate is within a factor of two of the measured temperature at which clear blockage behavior is seen. Thus, the temperature dependence of the observed current within the Coulomb gap is consistent with the observation of blockade behavior. From the threshold voltage, V<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&equals;&agr;Ne/C, and this estimate of E<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, &agr;N is approximately 10. The energy E<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>can also be estimated if the capacitance of an island is known. The capacitance of an isolated Au<highlight><subscript>55 </subscript></highlight>cluster is C&equals;4&pgr;&egr;&egr;<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&tgr;, where &tgr; is the radius of the cluster and e is the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium. The radius of a Au<highlight><subscript>55 </subscript></highlight>is 0.7 nm and the ligand shell is expected to have &egr;&equals;3, which C&equals;2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;19</superscript></highlight>F. The Coulomb charging energy, E<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>&equals;e<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/2C&ap;340 meV which is within twenty percent of the maximum value of 4E<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>found from the activation data. This result suggests that the current suppression is due to charging of individual AU<highlight><subscript>55 </subscript></highlight>clusters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Given the constraint that steps in the I-V characteristics are only found when f&lt;0. 1(R<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>C), the fact that steps are seen up to f&equals;5 MHz gives the upper limit R<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&lt;1&times;10<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>&OHgr;. The differential resistance obtained from the I-V characteristic well above threshold is anticipated to be R<highlight><subscript>diff</subscript></highlight>&ap;(N/M)R<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>, where M is the number of parallel channels. This estimate yields N/M&gE;30. From the sample dimensions and the size of an individual custer, a close packed array would have N/M&tilde;5. This disparity between the expected and experimentally derived values of the N/M suggests that the full width of the sample is not involved in transport. One explanation for the discrepancy in N/M may be that many of the gold cores coalesce during sample fabrication so that transport is dominated by individual clusters between larger regions of gold. </paragraph>

Prefabricated electrodes were drop-cast with a 2.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5 </superscript></highlight>mol/l solution of 56,000 amu poly-L-Lysine&bull;HBr in H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O/CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>OH. After a 20-hour soak in 1% NaOH in nanopure water and a nanopure water rinse, the current-voltage characteristics of the sample were found be be comparable with that of a bare electrode. The polylysine coated electrode was then exposed to a drop of 11-mercaptoundeconic ligand-stabilized gold clusters in DMSO (about 8 mg/l ml). After about 20 minutes, the sample was subjected to a thorough rinse with DMSO followed by another rinse in methylene chloride. After correcting for the leakage current of the bare electrode, the current-voltage characteristic of the sample were measured, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> A TEM grid was prepared as well using the polylysine scaffold and the 11-mercaptoundeconic ligand-stabilized gold clusters in DMSO. The polylysine solution was drop cast onto TEM grids. A 20-hour soak in 1% NaOH was followed by a nanopure water rinse. The dry TEM grids were then exposed to a drop of 11-mercaptoundeconic ligand-stabilized gold clusters in DMSO. After about twenty minutes, the grids were thoroughly rinsed, first using DMSO and then using methylene chloride. Lines of clusters can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> This example describes how to make electrical connections to metal cluster arrays. Saw tooth interdigitated array (IDA) gold electrodes are used and are made using electron beam lithiography. The gap between saw tooth points in the array will be approximately 200-300 Angstroms. An omega-amino alkanethiol will be chemisorbed to the gold surface and subsequently electrochemically desorbed from one set of the IDA fingers. An omega-NHS-ester alkylthiol will be attached to the bare set of fingers. A precursor to poly-L-lysine will be polymerized from the amino-modified fingers toward the NHS-ester fingers where the growing end will be captured. The side chains of the poly-L-lysine chain will be deprotected and treated with carboxy-terminated gold nanoparticles to form the desired one-dimensional array. Gates will be incorporated either under the substrate or as an additional electrode near (above) the surface of the device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to methods for designing inhibitors of serine/theronine kinases and tyrosine kinases, particularly MAP kinases, through the use of ATP-binding site mutants of those kinases. The methods of this invention take advantage of the fact that the mutant kinases are capable of binding inhibitory compounds of other kinases with greater affinity than the corresponding wild-type kinase. The invention further relates to the mutant kinases themselves and crystallizable co-complexes of the mutant kinase and the inhibitory compound. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">I. FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is in the field of biotechnology. More specifically, the invention is in a field often referred to as enzyme engineering, in which through genetic alterations or other means, the amino acid sequences of enzymes of interest are changed in order to alter or improve their catalytic properties. The embodiments of the invention which are described below involve methods in the fields of genetic engineering and enzymology, and more particularly, to the design of protein kinases and other multi-substrate enzymes, including inhibitable such enzymes, and to related materials, techniques and uses. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is only logical that cell-to-cell communications in a multicellular organism must be fast, and that they must be able to allow cells to respond to one another in diverse and complex ways. Typically, the intracellular signals used are molecules called &ldquo;ligands,&rdquo; and a given ligand can bind to a particular type of receptor on the surface of those cells that are to receive that signal. But this simple ligand binding alone is not enough to provide for the complex responses that the receiving cells may need to make. Cells therefore amplify and add complexity to this signal through complex, often cascading mechanisms leading to the rapid modulation of catalytic activities inside the cell, which in turn can produce complex, and sometimes dramatic, intracellular responses. This process as a whole, from initial ligand binding to completion of the intracellular response, is called &ldquo;signal transduction.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Signal transduction is often accomplished by the activation of intracellular enzymes that can act upon other enzymes and change their catalytic activity. This may lead to increases or decreases in the activity certain metabolic pathways, or may lead to even large intracellular changes, for example, the initiation of specific patterns of gene expression. The ability of one enzyme to alter the activity of other enzymes generally indicates that the enzyme is involved in cellular signal transduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The most common covalent modification used in signal transduction process is phosphorylation, which results in the alteration of the activity of those enzymes which become phosphorylated. This phosphorylation is catalyzed by enzymes known as protein kinases, which are often simply referred to as &ldquo;kinases.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Several key features of the kinases make them ideally suited as signaling proteins. One is that they often have overlapping target substrate specificities, which allows &ldquo;cross-talk&rdquo; among different signaling pathways, thus allowing for the integration of different signals (1). This is thought to be a result of the need for each kinase to phosphorylate several substrates before a response is elicited, which in turn provides for many types of diverse signaling outcomes. For example, a given kinase may in one instance transmit a growth inhibitory signal and in another instance transmit a growth promoting signal, depending on the structure of the extracellular ligand that has bound to the cell surface (2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A second key feature is that the kinases are organized into several modular functional regions, or &ldquo;domains&rdquo; (3). One domain known as &ldquo;SH3&rdquo;is a proline-rich region of 55-70 amino acids in length, and another, known as &ldquo;SH2,&rdquo; is a phosphotyrosine-binding region of about 100 amino acids in length. These two domains are believed to be involved in recognizing and binding to the protein substrates. The third domain, &ldquo;SH1,&rdquo; is comprised of about 270 amino acids, and is the domain which is responsible for catalysis. It also contains the binding site for the nucleoside triphosphate which is used as energy source and phosphate donor (3). Other domains, including myristylation and palmitylation sites, along with SH2 and SH3, are responsible for assembling multiprotein complexes which guide the catalytic domain to the correct targets (3,22,23). Molecular recognition by the various domains has been studied using by x-ray diffraction and by using NMR methods (24-28). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These domains appear to have been mixed and matched through evolution to produce the large protein kinase &ldquo;family.&rdquo; As many as 1000 kinases are thought to be encoded in the mammalian genome (4), and over 250 kinases have already been identified. The large number of kinases and the large number of phosphorylation-modulated enzymes that are known to exist inside cells allow for rapid signal amplification and multiple points of regulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A third key feature of the kinases is their speed. The kinetics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is extremely rapid in many cells (on a millisecond time scale), providing for rapid responses and short recovery times, which in turn makes repeated signal transmission possible (5). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These features of the kinases have apparently led them to be used in a vast array of different intracellular signal transduction mechanisms. For example, growth factors, transcription factors, hormones, cell cycle regulatory proteins, and many other classes of cellular regulators utilize tyrosine kinases in their signaling cascades (12,13). Tyrosine kinases catalytically attach a phosphate to one or more tyrosine residues on their protein substrates. The tyrosine kinases include proteins with many diverse functions including the cell cycle control element c-abl (14-16), epidermal growth factor receptor which contains a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain (12),c-src. a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in many immune cell functions (13), and Tyk2, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase which is involved in phosphorylation of the p91 protein which is translocated to the nucleus upon receptor stimulation and functions as a transcription factor (17). The serine/threonine kinases make up much if not all of the remainder of the kinase family; these catalytically phosphorylate serine and threonine residues in their protein substrates, and they have similarly diverse roles. They share homology in the 270 amino acid catalytic domain with tyrosine kinases. As such, although the discussion which follows focuses more particularly on the tyrosine kinases, that discussion is generally applicable to the serine/threonine kinases as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, the very features which make kinases so useful in signal transduction, and which has made them evolve to become central to almost every cellular function, also makes them extremely difficult, if not impossible, to study and understand. Their overlapping protein specificities, their structural and catalytic similarities, their large number, and their great speed make the specific identification of their in vivo protein substrates extremely difficult, if not impossible, using current genetic and biochemical techniques. This is today the main obstacle to deciphering the signaling cascades involved in tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction (4,6-8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Efforts to dissect the involvement of specific tyrosine kinases in signal transduction cascades have been frustrated by their apparent lack of protein substrate specificity in vitro and in vivo (4,8). The catalytic domains of tyrosine kinases possess little or no inherent protein substrate specificity, as demonstrated by domain swapping experiments (18-23). The catalytic domain from one tyrosine kinase can be substituted into a different tyrosine kinase with little change in the protein substrate specificity of the latter (22). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The poor in vitro specificity of kinases also makes it difficult, if not impossible, to extrapolate what the in vivo function of given kinases might be. An isolated tyrosine kinase of interest will often phosphorylate many test protein substrates with equal efficiency (29). This apparently poor substrate specificity is also found in vivo; for example, many genetic approaches, such as gene knock out experiments, give no interpretable phenotype due to compensation by other cellular tyrosine kinases (30,31). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another complication is that many tyrosine kinases have been proposed to phosphorylate downstream and upstream proteins which are themselves tyrosine kinases; although this appears to make complex positive feedback loops possible, it also makes dissecting the cascade even more difficult (1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> One important avenue for deciphering the role and understanding the function of enzymes, both in vitro and in vivo, is the use of specific enzyme inhibitors. If one or more compound can be found that will inhibit the enzyme, the inhibitor can be used to modulate the enzyme&apos;s activity, and the effects of that decrease can be observed. Such approaches have been instrumental in deciphering many of the pathways of intermediary metabolism, and have also been important in learning about enzyme kinetics and determining catalytic mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In addition, such inhibitors are among the most important pharmaceutical compounds known. For example, asprin (acetylsalicylic acid) is such an inhibitor. It inhibits an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in prostaglandin synthesis, thus inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins, which are involved in producing pain (72). Traditional drug discovery can be characterized as the design and modification of compounds designed specifically to bind to and inactivate a disease-causing protein; the relative success of such an effort depends upon the selectivity of the drug for the target protein and its lack of inhibition of non-disease associated enzymes with similar enzyme activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Such approaches would appear to be promising ways to develop treatments for cancer, since many human cancers are caused by disregulation of a normal protein (e.g., when a proto-oncogene is converted to an oncogene through a gene translocation). And since kinases are key regulators, they have turned out to be very common proto-oncogenes, and thus ideal drug design targets. The process of designing selective inhibitors is relatively simple in cases where few similar enzymes are present in the target organism, for example in cases where inhibitors of a protein unique to bacteria can be targeted. But unfortunately, the similarities between the kinases and their large number has almost completely frustrated the discovery and design of specific inhibitors, and has blocked most hopes of developing specific pharmaceutical treatments aimed at the proto-oncogene level. It is expected that the vast majority of candidate inhibitors will inhibit multiple kinases, even though they may have initially been identified as inhibiting a particular, purified kinase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> This is not to say, however, that inhibitors with at least some degree of kinase-specificity cannot be found. Several natural products have been identified which are relatively specific for particular kinase families, but attempts to derive general rules about kinase inhibition based on these has failed. Furthermore, as the following examples show, specificity in most cases is quite limited. For example, the compound Damnacanthal was reported to be a &ldquo;highly potent, selective inhibitor&rdquo; of the kinase p56lck (73); as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, this compound has an inhibition constant (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>) for that kinase which is almost seven times lower than for the kinase src (the IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>is the concentration of inhibitor which must be added to reduce catalytic activity by 50%). The compound PPI (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>) has a binding affinity for the kinase lck which is very strong (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.005 &mgr;M); but unfortunately, the inhibition of other kinases of the src family is very similar. It inhibits the kinase fyn with an almost identical IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>. 0.006 &mgr;M, and has only about a 4-fold higher IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>for the kinase hck (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.020 &mgr;M). The compound CGP 57148 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>) has been reported to be &ldquo;semi-selective&rdquo; for the kinases abl (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.025 &mgr;M) and PDGFR (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;0.030 &mgr;M)(74). Nevertheless, considering the vast number of kinases and their relative cellular importance, and also considering that the above-described inhibitors have only been reported in the last two years, it appears that success in discovering or designing selective kinase inhibitors has been remarkably limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> These difficulties described above have implications well beyond the mere frustration of scientists; they have frustrated efforts to decipher the kinase cascades and the function of individual kinases in those cascades and other cellular mechanisms. Such an understanding of kinase activity and function may be essential before certain human diseases can be effectively treated, prevented or cured. For example, it has been known for over 30 years that the oncogene bcr-abl is a protein kinase that is responsible for chronic myelogenous leukemia; but the physiological substrates that it acts upon to cause oncogenesis, which may be important drug design targets, have yet to be definitively identified (11). On the bright side, despite this shortcoming, the above-described inhibitor CGP 57148 is reportedly now undergoing clinical trials for use in treating myelogenous leukemia, even though the substrates it may block phosphorylation of in vivo are not known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The medical significance of these difficulties is further illustrated by the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), which has become an important model system for studying the role of kinases in oncogenesis. RSV transformation of fibroblasts is controlled by a single viral gene product, the protein tyrosine kinase v-src (32). It is the rapid time course and the dramatic morphological changes during RSV fibroblast transformation that have made RSV a paradigm for studies of oncogene activity in all cells. The origin (33), regulation (3,8,34,35), and structure (25,27,36) of v-Src have been extensively studied and are well understood (8,37,38). But central questions about this intensely studied kinase remains unanswered: what are its direct cellular substrates&quest; Does inhibition of its catalytic activity effectively inhibit, or even reverse, transformation&quest; Would such inhibition be an effective therapy for or prophylactic against RSV transformation&quest; Unfortunately, as discussed above, the answers to these questions are not forthcoming, largely because the number of cellular kinases is enormous (it is estimated that 2% of the mammalian genome encodes protein kinases (4)) and because tyrosine kinases display overlapping substrate specificities (8,39) and share catalytic domains, making the design of specific inhibitors enormously difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The expression of v-Src in fibroblasts results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of over 50 cellular proteins (37). These same substrates are also phosphorylated by other kinases in untransformed fibroblasts (40). Even the most sophisticated biochemical and genetic techniques, including anti-phosphotyrosine protein blots of transformed fibroblasts, transfection of fibroblasts with transformation-defective v-Src mutants, temperature-sensitive v-Src mutants, gene knock-out studies of cellular Src, host-range dependent Src mutants, anti-v-Src immunoprecipitation, and use of kinase-specific inhibitors, have not led to the unambiguous identification of v-Src&apos;s direct substrates (see reference (38) for a comprehensive review). But this situation is not unique; in fact, the direct substrates for the majority of cellular kinases remain unidentified (8). Furthermore, as discussed above, there also are remarkably few compounds known to selectively inhibit individual kinases, or even groups of related kinases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Although the forgoing difficulties are daunting, new methods of rational drug design and combinatorial organic synthesis make the design or discovery of kinase-specific inhibitors feasible given sufficient resources. However, because the kinase networks are highly degenerate and interconnected in unknown ways, there is considerable uncertainty with regard to many diseases which kinases should be targeted for inhibition. Moreover, it is by no means clear that a specific inhibitor of a given kinase will have any effect on the disease, either in vitro or in vivo. Because kinases can be highly promiscuous, there is a significant chance that inhibiting one kinase will simply force another kinase to &ldquo;take its place.&rdquo; Therefore, there is a need for a simple and direct way to determine the biochemical and cellular effects of inhibiting a given kinase, before herculean efforts are undertaken to design or discover specific inhibitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> From the forgoing, it is clear that there has been a long felt but unsatisfied need for ways to identify which cellular proteins are acted upon by individual protein kinases. Such a method would ideally also allow for the quantitative measurement of relative activity of a given kinase on its protein substrates, which could be used, for example, to detect how or whether actual or potential drug compounds might modulate kinase activity. In addition, there has also been a need for specific inhibitors of individual kinases or kinase families, which could be used to identify protein substrates (by looking for which proteins are not phosphorylated or are more weakly phospohorylated in the presence of the inhibitor), to study the biochemical and phenotypic effects of rapidly down-regulating a given kinase&apos;s activity, for use as drugs to treat kinase-mediated diseases, and to confirm that tedious efforts to design or develop more traditional inhibitor drugs would be worthwhile. As is described in considerable detail below, the present invention for the first time provides a method for the highly specific inhibition of individual kinases, which have been engineered to bind the inhibitor more readily than the wild-type form of that kinase or other, non-engineered kinases. The invention also provides for the engineered kinases and the inhibitors to which they are adapted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Moreover, as will become apparent, this method is even more broadly applicable, as it would provide similar advantages for the study of other enzymes which, like the kinases, covalently attach part of at least one substrate to at least one other substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention involves the engineering of kinases and other multi-substrate enzymes such that they can become bound by inhibitors which are not as readily bound by their wild-type forms. Modified substrates and mutant enzymes that can bind them have been used to study an elongation factor (41) and a receptor for cyclophilin A (42). However, prior to the present invention, it was not known how, or even if, multi-substrates enzymes which covalently attach part or all of a donor substrate onto a recipient substrate could be engineered to bind to an inhibitor, yet still retain at least some catalytic activity and at least some specificity for the recipient substrate in the absence of the inhibitor. The present invention is that this can be done, as explained below; and this invention for the first time opens the door to the selective inhibition of individual kinases, which are not only important tools for understanding of the kinase cascades and other complex catalytic cellular mechanisms, but also may provide avenues for therapeutic intervention in diseases where those mechanisms come into play. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">III. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a solution to the above-described problems by providing materials and methods by which a single protein kinase can be specifically inhibited, without the simultaneous inhibition of other protein kinases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a first aspect, the present invention involves the engineering of kinases and other multi-substrate enzymes such that they can utilize modified substrates which are not as readily used by their wild-type forms. The invention further provides such chemically modified nucleotide triphosphate substrates, methods of making them, and methods of using them. The methods of the present invention include methods for using the modified substrates along with the engineered kinases to identify which protein substrates the kinases act upon, to measure the extent of such action, and to determine if test compounds can modulate such action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the invention provides engineered protein kinases which can bind inhibitors that are not as readily bound by the wild-type forms of those enzymes. Methods of making and using all such engineered kinases are also provided. The invention further provides such inhibitors, methods of making them, and methods of using them. The methods of the present invention include methods for using the inhibitors along with the engineered kinases to identify which protein substrates the kinases act upon, to measure the kinetics of such action, and to determine the biochemical and cellular effects of such inhibition. They also relate to the use of such inhibitors and engineered kinases to elucidate which kinases may be involved in disease; these kinases can then become the subject of efforts to design or discover more traditional specific inhibitors of their wild-type forms, which may prove to be valuable in treating the kinase-related disease or disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, methods are provided for inserting the engineered kinase into cells or whole animals, preferably in place of the corresponding wild-type kinase, and then using the inhibitor to which it has been adapted as a tool for study of the disease-kinase relationship, and ultimately, as a drug for the treatment of the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present invention also more generally relates to engineered forms of multi-substrate enzymes which covalently attach part or all of at least one (donor) substrate to at least one other (recipient) substrate. These engineered forms will accept modified substrates and inhibitors that are not as readily bound by the wild-type forms of those enzymes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The-invention also relates to methods for making and using such engineered enzymes, as well as the modified donor substrates. The methods of the present invention include methods for using the modified substrates and inhibitors along with the engineered enzymes to identify which substrates the enzymes act upon, to measure the kinetics of such action, and in the instance of the modified substrates, to determine the recipient substrates to which part or all of the donor substrate becomes attached, to measure the extent of such action, and to identify and measure the extent of modulation thereof by test compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the instance of inhibitors, the methods seek to determine the biochemical and cellular effects of such inhibition. The methods also extend to the use of such inhibitors and engineered enzymes to elucidate which enzymes may be involved in disease; these enzymes can then become the subject of efforts to design or discover specific inhibitors of their wild-type forms, which may prove to be valuable in treating the enzyme-related disease or disorder. Furthermore, methods are provided for inserting the engineered enzyme into cells or whole animals, preferably in place of the corresponding wild-type enzyme, and then using the inhibitor to which it has been adapted as a tool for study of the disease-enzyme relationship, and ultimately, as a drug for the treatment of the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, through enzyme engineering a structural distinction can be made between the nucleotide binding site of a protein kinase of interest, and the nucleotide binding sites of other kinases. This distinction allows the engineered kinase to use a nucleotide triphosphate or an inhibitor that is not as readily bound by the wild-type form of that kinase, or by other kinases. In a preferred embodiment with respect to the inhibitor, the inhibitor used is one that is &ldquo;orthogonal&rdquo; to the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; nucleotide triphosphate substrate for that kinase, or is orthogonal to a less specific inhibitor (e.g., one which is readily bound by the wild-type form of that kinase). The term &ldquo;orthogonal,&rdquo; as further discussed below, means that the substrate or inhibitor is similar in structure (including those that are geometrically similar but not chemically similar, as described below), but differs in a way that limits its ability to bind to the wild-type form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An engineered kinase made according to the present invention will be able to use an orthogonal nucleotide triphosphate substrate that is not as readily used by other, non-engineered kinases present in cells. Preferably, it will be able to use an orthogonal nucleotide triphosphate that is not substantially used by other kinases; and most preferably, it will be able to use an orthogonal nucleotide triphosphate substrate that can not be used at all by other kinases. By labeling the phosphate on the orthogonal substrate, e.g., by using radioactive phosphorous (P<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>), and then adding that labeled substrate to permiabilized cells or cell extracts, the protein substrates of the engineered kinase will become labeled, whereas the protein substrates of other kinases will be at least labeled to a lesser degree; preferably, the protein substrates of the other kinases will not be substantially labeled, and most preferably, they will not be labeled at all.</paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The detailed description and examples provided below describe the use of this strategy to uniquely tag the direct substrates of the prototypical tyrosine kinase, v-Src. Through protein engineering a chemical difference has been made in the amino acid sequence which imparts a new structural distinction between the nucleotide binding site of the modified v-Src and that of all other kinases. The v-Src kinase we have engineered recognizes an ATP analog (A*TP), N<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>-(cyclopentyl)ATP, which is orthogonal to the nucleotide substrate of wild-type kinases. The generation of a v-Src mutant with specificity for an orthogonal A*TP substrate allows for the direct substrates of v-Src to be uniquely radiolabeled using &lsqb;&ggr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb; N<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>-(cyclopentyl)ATP, because it is able to serve as substrate to the engineered v-Src kinase, but is not substantially able to serve as substrate for other cellular kinases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The detailed description and examples provided below describe the use of this strategy to uniquely identify the direct substrates of the prototypical tyrosine kinase, v-Src. Through protein engineering a chemical difference has been made in the amino acid sequence which imparts a new structural distinction between the nucleotide binding site of the modified v-Src and that of all other kinases. The engineered v-Src kinases that have been made and presented herein bind to an orthogonal analog of the more general kinase inhibitor PP3: the compound N04 cyclopentoyl PP3. The generation of a v-Src mutant with specificity for such an inhibitor allows for the mutant to be inhibited, whereas other kinases in the same test system are not substantially inhibited, not even the wild-type form of that same kinase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the forgoing, it is one object of the present invention to provide a mutant protein kinase which accepts an orthogonal nucleotide triphosphate analog as a phosphate donor substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention to provide a nucleotide sequence which encodes such a mutant protein kinase; and it is a further object to provide a method for producing such a nucleic acid sequence. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">V. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> This figure shows a schematic representation of an experiment to Identify Kinase Substrates below which uses the invention for discovery of the substrates of a Src protein kinase. The ovals at the top of the figure represent protein kinase substrates which become phosphorylated by the protein kinases adjacent to the arrow. The protein kinases containing several ovals connected by lines are members of the &ldquo;Src-Family&rdquo; of protein kinases (Src, Fyn, Lck). One kinase (Src) contains a notch cut out which represents the I338G mutation which creates an extra space in the adenine binding pocket of this kinase. The symbol above this kinase represents the orthogonal inhibitor which contains a protrusion which complements the mutation in the Src I338G kinase, resulting in its unique inhibition. The kinase with a large round oval and two protruding stings is the F-Actin Dependent protein kinase (FAK). The protein kinases with only an oval are members of the serine or threonine specific protein kinase family. The ovals below the arrow containing small P&apos;s represent the phosphorylated (P) substrates after action by the protein kinases. The simulated gels at the bottom of the figure represent the expected results if cells expressing either all wild-type kinases (on left) or one mutant kinase (Src-I338G) in place of wild-type Src are treated with the orthogonal inhibitor. The inhibitor should have no effect on the phosphoproteins present in the cells which do not express the mutant Src kinase (identical pattern in the gel on the left) and several phosphoproteins should be absent following treatment of the mutant expressing cells with the inhibitor (gel on the right). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The Inhibitors </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</cross-reference> show the structures of a variety of bulky substituents which, when added to either N-4 of PP3 or to N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>of adenosine diphosphate, or to N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>of adenosine monophosphate, or to N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>of adenosine (specifically N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cyclopentyloxy adenosine) to produce inhibitors of the mutant kinase v-Src(T120G), which is an engineered kinase of the present invention; the synthesis and inhibition constants for these inhibitors are discussed in Example 12 below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Such inhibitors may be useful in studies directed towards developing other useful mutants of this and other kinases, and for the several methods described elsewhere herein. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the use of these particular inhibitors, and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many other possible structures could be substituted for or supplement those described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> For example, different, simpler, and even more complex aliphatic or aromatic groups could be added to the N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>position of ADP or to the N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>position of PP3. In addition, the inhibitors of the present invention are not limited to modifications of nucleotides at the N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>position or modifications of PP3 at the N<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>position. Chemical means to modify various positions on such compounds are known, and any of the resulting derivatives would be within the scope of the present invention; it is even possible to make changes or substitutions in their ring structures. Exemplary variants are presented herein, and particular reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> where both analogs and data relating to their activity is set forth. Of course, the use of such inhibitors may require that different positions in the protein sequence of the kinase be modified in order to make an engineered kinase that will bind to them, but such different modifications are well within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is important to note that the inhibitors of the present invention are not limited to ADP and PP3 derivatives. For example, it should be possible to utilize derivatives of other natural nucleotide phosphate donor substrate as such inhibitors. For studying some kinases, different analog bases may in fact be preferred. For example, it is known that some kinases utilize GTP as phosphate donor substrate and energy source; to make inhibitors for engineered forms of such kinases, analogs of guanosine diphosphate would be suitable. Furthermore, it is well known that related compounds (e.g., other bases) and compounds chemically unrelated to the natural substrate can sometimes nevertheless bind to an active site, and can (but for the purposes of this invention need not), be acted upon or act upon other substrates through chemical catalysis by the enzyme. Sometimes they participate in the catalyzed reaction in the same way as the natural substrate, sometimes in different ways. Such compounds and their derivatives would be suitable starting points for the design of inhibitors that are orthogonal to them, and which would be within the scope of the present invention. Similarly, other known kinase inhibitors can be used as a starting point for synthesis of inhibitors of the present invention, such as those whose structures appear in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Of course, even derivatives of inhibitors that are currently unknown would, once identified, be suitable core structures for the design of inhibitors of the present invention, as illustrated herein and made a part hereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the inhibitors of the present invention are not limited to those made by chemical synthetic means, but also include compounds which may be found in nature, and which can serve that role, some of which are discussed above. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are other variations besides those set forth here, and that these are all within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The inhibitors that are candidates for use in accordance with the present invention can conveniently be screened to determine the extent to which they are accepted by wild-type kinases, using a screening procedure such as that set forth in Example 13 below, or by a screening procudure involving the use of a cell or cells which are rich in protein kinase activity as set forth in Example 9 herein. By such an assay, one can determine whether each inhibitor is bound by wild-type kinases to a lesser degree than the engineered kinases, or preferably, if the wild-type kinases do not substantially bind to that inhibitor, or most preferably, do not bind the inhibitor at all. For those substrates that are least less readily bound, it may be worthwhile to try to engineer the kinase of interest so that it will more readily bind to them. Of course, one could make the engineered kinase first and then assay it along side the wild-type enzyme to determine whether it uses a given orthogonal substrate better than the wild-type kinase; this was the approach used in Example 13. However, under most circumstances, pre-screening as described above will be preferred. Of course. other assay approaches will be apparent to those in the field, and the use of such assays would be within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The Engineered Kinases There are several criteria that should be satisfied in reengineering a kinase in order to uniquely tag its authentic substrates in the presence of wild type tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. The engineered kinase should: (1) accept an ATP analog (A*TP) that is utilized less readily by wild-type protein kinases; preferably, accept an A*TP that is not substantially utilized by wild-type kinases; and most preferably, accept an A*TP that is not utilized by wild-type kinases at all; (2) preferably, use the A*TP analog with high catalytic efficiency; and (3) preferably, have reduced catalytic efficiency for the natural nucleotide substrate (ATP) so that in the presence of cellular levels of ATP (1-2 mM) the mutated kinase would preferentially utilize A*TP as the phosphodonor. If such engineered kinases are to be used to study the protein substrate specificity of the wild-type kinase, then these criteria must be met without substantially altering the protein target specificity of the kinase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Likewise several criteria should be satisfied in reengineering a kinase in order that it will be inhibited by the inhibitors of the present invention. The engineered kinase should: (1) bind to an inhibitor which is bound less readily by wild-type protein kinases; preferably, the inhibitor will not substantially bind to wild-type kinases; and most preferably, will not bind at all to wild type kinases; (2) preferably, the engineered kinase will bind the inhibitor with high affinity (i.e., low IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>). It is not generally of particular importance whether the inhibitor binds to the wild-type form of the kinase that corresponds to the engineered kinase, as such binding and the resulting inhibition would augment that of the engineered kinase. However, it is most likely that the wild-type form of that kinase will not bind the inhibitor any better than other wild-type kinases. If an inhibitable engineered kinase is to be used to study the protein substrate specificity of the wild-type kinase, or to replace the wild-type form of that kinase through gene therapy or other means, as further discussed below, then a further concern is that the above-described criteria must preferably be met without substantially altering the protein target specificity of the engineered kinase when compared with the corresponding wild-type form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> When viewed from the perspective of the state of the art when the present invention was made, it was not predictable whether it would be possible to satisfy all of these criteria simultaneously; in fact, it was doubtful, because the ATP binding site that is engineered is very close to the second substrate binding site, i.e., the peptide binding site. However, as shown by the examples below, all of these criteria, including the preferred criteria, were in fact met simultaneously when we made the described v-Src mutants, provided them with N<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>(cyclopentyl)ATP and inhibited them using N4-cyclopentyl PP3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Example 1 describes the twelve ATP analogs which were used in the studies on mutant v-Src, which are described in the further examples which follow. These orthogonal ATP analogs may be useful in studies directed towards developing other useful mutants of this and other kinases, and for the several methods described elsewhere herein. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the use of these particular ATP analogs, and those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many other possible orthogonal substrates could be substituted for or supplement those described herein. For example, different and even more complex aliphatic or aromatic groups could be added to the N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>position of ATP. In addition, the orthogonal substrates of the present invention are not limited to modifications of nucleotides at the N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>position. Chemical means to modify various positions on adenosine are known, and any of these would be within the scope of the present invention; and it is even possible to make changes or substitutions in the ring structures of nucleotides. Of course, the use of such orthogonal substrates may require that different positions in the protein sequence of the kinase be modified in order to make an engineered kinase that will bind to them, but such different modifications are well within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In addition, it is important to note that the orthogonal substrates of the present invention are not limited to ATP derivatives. For studying different kinases. different analog bases may in fact be preferred. For example, it is known that some kinases utilize GTP as phosphate donor substrate and energy source; for studies of such kinases, analogs of guanosine triphosphate would be preferred. It is well known that compounds chemically unrelated to the natural substrate can sometimes nevertheless bind to an active site, and can even be acted upon or act upon other substrates through chemical catalysis by the enzyme. Sometimes they participate in the catalyzed reaction in the same way as the natural substrate, sometimes in different ways. Such compounds and their derivatives would also be within the scope of the terms &ldquo;natural substrate&rdquo; and &ldquo;orthogonal substrate&rdquo; as used herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the orthogonal substrates of the present invention are not limited to those made by chemical synthetic means, but also include compounds which may be found in nature, and which can serve that role. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are other variations besides those set forth here, and that these are all within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The orthogonal nucleotides that are candidates for use in accordance with the present invention can conveniently be screened to determine the extent to which they are accepted by wild-type kinases, using a screening procedure such as that set forth in Example 2 below. By such an assay, one can determine whether each orthogonal substrate is accepted by wild-type kinases to a lesser degree than the normal substrate for such kinases, or preferably, do not substantially accept that substrate, or most preferably, do not accept it at all. For those substrates that are least less readily accepted, it may be worthwhile to try to engineer the kinase of interest so that it will more readily accept them. Of course, one could make the engineered kinase first and then assay it along side the wild-type enzyme to determine whether it uses a given orthogonal substrate better than the wild-type kinase. However, under most circumstances, pre-screening such as is described in Example 2 will be preferred. Of course, other assay approaches will be apparent to those in the field, and the use of such assays would be within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The design of an engineered v-Src is described in Example 3 below. As is described, the engineered form was designed by reference to the crystal structures of other kinases which have domains that are homologous to those found in most if not all kinases. As will be seen, the example mutant kinases described herein have been constructed as fragments of protein kinases, rather than as containing the entire sequences; but it was found there is no substantial difference in performance when the entire sequence is used. Of course, the concepts and the practicalities are the same whether fragments or whole kinases are used, and both are within the scope of the present invention. As such, the term &ldquo;kinase&rdquo; should be viewed as including the whole enzyme or a fragment of one, including when interpreting the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Using this approach, it is possible to design similar mutants of virtually any other kinase. The method for doing this comprises the steps of: (a) identifying, from the crystal structure of an identical or homologous enzyme bound to its phosphate donor substrate or to a known kinase inhibitor (which may be non-specific for kinases, specific for kinases generally but not for that kinase, or specific for that kinase), one or more amino acids other than glycine which are close enough to a substituent on the bound phosphate donor substrate or inhibitor that they would sterically restrict entry of a bulky substituent attached to that substituent in a putative orthagonal inhibitor; and (b) mutating a nucleotide sequence which encodes the wild-type protein kinase such that the nucleotide triplets encoding one or more of the identified amino acids, are converted to nucleotide triplets that encode amino acids having side chains that are sterically less bulky than the identified amino acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The above-described method uses steric restriction of entry or exclusion as the criteria for deciding which amino acid(s) to change, and how to change them. However, the present invention is not so limited. It is also possible to engineer a kinase to change its ability to bind to an orthogonal substrate by considering other factors, such as hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, ionic binding or repulsion, hydrogen bonding, forming covalent bonds between the enzyme and electrophilic groups on orthogonal substrates, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The study of protein kinases using the present invention will be greatly facilitated by the vast knowledge regarding the domain structure of many different kinases, and their generally homologous sequences. The Protein Kinase Fact Book (71) provides protein sequence data for the three functional domains in literally hundreds of protein kinases, and this along with sequence information available in the primary literature, should greatly facilitate the further application of the present invention to the kinases. Similar information is available regarding other multi-substrate enzymes, which should facilitate their study and use according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Although the preferred method of the present invention involves the rational design of substrate analogs and mutant protein kinases, both could alternatively be made by use of methods known as combinatorial methods. There are many combinatorial methods of synthesizing organic compounds. Using one such method, one could synthesize nucleoside analogs on resin beads using sequential chemical steps, and then release them from the resin prior to phosphorylation to make the nucleotide triphosphates. After using such a method to make a collection or library of putative orthogonal substrates for mutants of v-Src kinase, other protein kinase, or other multi-substrate enzymes, the collection or library could be screened for particularly favorable binding or catalytic properties. This may allow for the more thorough search of structural, conformational, and electronic features of such putative orthogonal substrates. Moreover, it is often found that when larger numbers of analogs of a given substrate are investigated, and unexpectedly efficient substrate or inhibitor can be found. Furthermore, sometimes the compounds which are the most desirable would not have been chosen if only well understood parameters were used to specifically design the best compound. There are also many combinatorial methods known in the art for making protein mutants. These include &ldquo;error prone&rdquo; polymerase chain reaction (PCR), &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; PCR, or PCR using primers with random nucleotides at fixed positions in the protein sequence. Other sequence randomization methods might include using chemical mutagens of cDNA or plasmid DNA, or MutD type strains of bacteria, which are known to introduce mutations randomly in proteins that they express. It would be possible to carry out the present invention by exploiting such methods for making randomly mutated protein kinases or other multi-substrate enzymes, and then screening for one with particularly high activity with a particular orthogonal substrate, or with some or all of the putative orthogonal substrates made using combinatorial synthesis, as described in the paragraph above. The assay methods described in the examples below would be suitable for this purpose, and those in the art would be readily able to design alternative approaches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> These methods and other methods which are or may be developed to explore protein sequence space and the structural space of small organic molecules might be particularly useful for the technological application described here, where we are changing or altering both the protein and the putative inhibitor in order to find the best possible non-natural (i.e., orthogonal) fit. The use of any of these or any of the other methods described herein would be within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The synthesis of one engineered kinase is described in Example 4. The focus of this effort was on amino acid side chains that were within about 4&angst; of the N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>of ATP; but there is nothing magical about that distance. Residues with side chains that are within about 1&angst;, 2&angst;, 3&angst;, 4&angst;, 5&angst;, 6&angst;, 7&angst;, 8&angst;, 9&angst;, 10&angst;, or lesser, greater or intermediate distances should also be considered as targets for modification. Amino acids within side chains that are within about 3&angst; to about 6&angst; would be preferred targets. Generally those amino acids with the closer side chains will be preferred over those with more distant side chains, as they would be expected to cause the greatest steric or other interference with the orthogonal substituent on the inhibitor; and those with the very closest side chains would be the most preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Of course, there are many other ways to modify and express genetic sequences today than those used in the examples, such as site-directed mutagenesis, and we can expect that other methods will be developed in the future. The use of any or all of these would be within the scope of the present invention. In addition, although the use of genetic engineering is today probably the preferred method to prepare such mutants, it is not the only way. For example, one could design an engineered kinase and then synthesize that protein by known methods of chemical peptide synthesis. Or, it may be possible to chemically modify a given enzyme in a specific location such that one or more side chain changes in size, hydrophobicity, or other characteristic, such that it can more readily utilize an orthogonal substrate. The use of all such methods are within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Example 7 describes testing which could be done to determine whether the engineered kinase had retained its protein substrate specificity. It is preferred that the wild-type protein substrate specificity be substantially retained if, as in the examples, the goal is to use the engineered kinase to study what substrates the kinase acts upon and to what degree it does so, or it is to be used to replace or supplement the corresponding wild-type kinase in vivo, e.g., through genetic engineering. However, although for such purposes it is important that the kinase still recognize the same substrates as the wild type, it is not critical that it do so with the same kinetics; i.e., if it does so slower or faster, or to a greater or lesser degree, the engineered kinase may still have substantial value for such purposes. If the engineered kinase does not recognize the same protein substrates as the wild-type enzyme, it may have less value in studying the wild-type enzyme, but may still have substantial value in studying protein phosphorylation and kinases in general, and would still be within the scope of the invention. Of course, the particular assays used in Example 7, although useful, need not be used. Those of skill in the art will readily be able to develop or adopt other assays that can provide comparable information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Once a mutant kinase has been made which accepts a given orthogonal substrate analog, or which is inhibited by a given inhibitor, it can be characterized using classical enzyme kinetic analysis, as illustrated in Examples 5 and 6. Also, as shown in Example 8, one can study the degree to which the mutant can utilize or be inhibited by the analog, and whether the analog is a &ldquo;dead&rdquo; (i.e., wholly ineffective) inhibitor for the wild-type enzyme. Of course, the methods used in the examples are not the only ways these studies can be done, and those of skill in the art can easily design alternate approaches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in Example 10, it is not necessary to make multiple amino acid substitutions to provide a mutant that will be inhibited by an inhibitor of the present invention. It may only be necessary to make a single amino acid change, as is the case with the mutants GST-XD4(I338&angst;) and GST-XD4 (I338G). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Assay to Identify Kinase Substrates </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> A very simple embodiment of the present invention would be as follows. First, the orthogonal inhibitor is added to two samples of the cell of interest which either express an added gene for the engineered kinase or express the normal copy of the kinase of interest. The inhibitor can be added before after or during the activation of a signaling cascade (such as permiabilized cells, cell extracts, or cells that are naturally permeable to them). Then a method which allows detection of all phosphorylated proteins in a cell or cell fraction, e.g., by using radioactive phosphorous &lsqb;&ggr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP or by using monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphorylated amino acids is used to reveal the result of specifically inhibition of the kinase of interest. In the cells expressing the normal copy of the kinase of interest, the protein substrates of the native kinase will become labeled, even in the presence of the inhibitor, whereas the protein substrates of the engineered kinase will at least be labeled to a lesser degree; preferably, the protein substrates of the engineered kinases will not be substantially labeled, and most preferably, they will not be labeled at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> It is also preferable if the wild-type kinase corresponding to the mutant has been removed from the cells, e.g., by &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; of the cellular gene(s) for it. If the labeled proteins of such an assay are examined in tandem with control samples containing the wild-type kinase but not the mutant kinase, certain bands will be diminished in intensity in the mutant-treated sample relative to the control. Preferably, the difference in intensity will be high; most preferably, there will be bands which are missing in the mutant-containing samples treated with the inhibitor. This would indicate that the wild-type form of that kinase phosphorylates those differentially labeled proteins; when the kinase is inhibited, those bands do not get labeled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Example 10 provides one example of a method of using a mutant kinase of the present invention, along with its orthogonal substrate analog or its inhibitor, as the case may be, to detect which are the intracellular protein substrates for that protein kinase. Developing such a test was a primary goal of the research that led to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Generally, the method described in Example 10 and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> would appear to be generally applicable; however, there are many other possible approaches that could be used, once a mutant that accepts an orthogonal substrate analog or inhibitor has been prepared. The natural phosphate donor substrate is first prepared to contain a labeled moiety on the terminal phosphate, for example, by replacing the phosphate with &lsqb;&ggr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb; phosphate. This substrate, along with the analog or inhibitor, is then added to a sample of lysed cells, cell extracts, permiabilized cells, or cells which are naturally permeable to the orthogonal nucleotide triphosphate substrate analog or to the inhibitor, and which express the mutant kinase, or to which the mutant kinase has been exogenously added (e.g., by microinjection). After incubation under conditions that will allow the mutant kinase to become inhibited, and/or to phosphorylate its protein substrates to the extent not inhibited, the labeled products are then extracted and analyzed in comparison with those produced by a control sample, which was treated substantially the same way, but without the addition of the analog or inhibitor, respectively. Methods for the detection of labeled proteins are well known, and include both quantitative and qualitative methods. In addition, all methods for characterizing and identifying proteins can be used to determine with specificity what the protein substrates are, and what their functions are. Ultimately, it should be possible to develop an understanding of what protein substrates each of the various protein kinases act upon, and reveal in great detail the mysteries of cellular signal transduction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Once one or more cellular protein substrate has been identified, similar assays can be used to identify drugs or other compounds that can modulate the activity of a given protein kinase on one or more substrates. For example, one could add small amounts of solutions of a variety of such compounds to test samples containing cell-free extract, mutant kinase, along with a labeled orthogonal substrate analog and/or inhibitor. The labeled proteins can then be identified, e.g., by gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography, and compared with a duplicate test sample treated the same way, but to which no drug or other compound was added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> If a protein is not labeled in a sample having an added compound plus substrate analog and/or inhibitor that does get labeled in a sample treated with the analog and/or the inhibitor, this indicates that the added compound has caused the kinase to phosphorylate a protein that it does not act on in the absence of the compound. i.e., the compound upwardly modulates the activity of the kinase for that protein. Alternatively, if a labeled protein appears in a test sample to which the compound or drug was added, but does not appear in a test sample not having the compound or drug added, this indicates that the added compound has prevented the kinase from phosphorylate a protein that it does act on in the absence of the compound, i.e., the compound downwardly modulates the activity of the kinase for that protein substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if quantitative measurements are made for each labeled protein, e.g., by scanning autoradiograms and integrating the data, more subtle effect on kinase activity can be detected. For example, it may be found that a protein is more fully or less fully phosphorylated in the presence or absence of a given compound (i.e., has been less dramatically modulated). It can also be expected that some compounds will upwardly modulate kinase activity for some proteins and downwardly modulate activity for others at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Use in Screening for Drug Design Target Kinases </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, because kinases play key roles in various diseases, it is of great interest to develop inhibitors which can specifically inhibit a single wild-type kinase or group of wild-type kinases. By down-modulating the activity of these disease-involved kinases, it should be possible to reduce the disease symptoms, or even cure the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> However, the great difficulty which has been experienced in making such inhibitors of wild-type kinases, as briefly described above, limits the potential of that approach. The primary difficulty is finding inhibitors which are specific, and do not inhibit other kinases than the intended target. The reasons for such non-specificity are (i) the nucleotide triphosphate binding sites of kinases are highly conserved in evolution, and (ii) many kinases are &ldquo;degenerate,&rdquo; that is, they have sufficiently similar activities and specificities that they can substitute for other kinases that because of gene deletion or other reason are absent or diminished in concentration in the cells. The problem of binding site similaries can in many instances be overcome, e.g., by careful rational inhibitor design, or by selection of inhibitors from combinatorial libraries on the basis of specificity. However, efforts to do so with a kinase that is truly degenerate with another kinase will likely be unfruitful; either all of the co-degenerate kinases will be inhibited by even the best candidate compounds, or even if the target is inhibited, it will be impossible to tell, because a degenerate kinase will &ldquo;take over&rdquo; the activity of the inhibited one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Because of this, there is a need for a way to screen kinases to determine which wild-type kinases are degenerate, and thus probably poor candidates for specific inhibition, and which are not degenerate, and therefore preferred candidates for specific inhibition. The present invention provides such a method. The present invention provides a means to generate a specific, unique kinase inhibitor for any kinase of interest, by making a mutant of the kinase that is specifically designed to be inhibited by candidate inhibitors selected, and then studying the effects of that inhibition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> One way to accomplish this is to test cells or cell extracts in vitro. For example, one could add ATP to such a sample which has one kind of label (the &ldquo;first label&rdquo;) on the terminal phosphate, and add the specific inhibitor which is differently labeled (the &ldquo;second label&rdquo;) at the terminal phosphate. The decrease in appearance of the second label on a given protein substrate (e.g., as viewed by gel electrophoresis) indicates specific inhibition of the mutant kinase; and appearance of the first label on that same substrate indicates that the other kinases have taken over that phosphorylation role, the degree of which is shown by the relative degree of such labeling. If it turns out that the engineered kinase is specifically inhibited, and other kinases do not take over phosphorylation of the substrates of the engineered kinase when it is inhibited. or at least do not completely take over, then that kinase is not degenerate, or at least not completely so; it is thus probably not a good candidate for development of a specific inhibitor of the wild-type for use as a drug to treat the disease it relates to. However, if inhibition of the mutant kinase with an inhibitor of the present invention is not compensated for by the other kinases, then it is a preferred candidate for the development of an inhibitor of the wild-type kinase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Another, preferred method of such screening would be to produce animal models for the disease of interest, and then &ldquo;knock out&rdquo; the wild-type gene, and then, by genetic engineering, insert into the genome a gene encoding a mutant kinase of the present invention &ldquo;knock-in&rdquo;. Then, an inhibitor of the present invention, preferably one which has been shown in vitro to inhibit the mutant, can be used to down-regulate the mutant kinase. If down regulation leads to a decrease in the symptoms or morbidity of the disease in the model animal, or eliminates the disease, then that kinase is a preferred candidate for the development of a specific inhibitor of the wild-type form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Gene Therapy Applications </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The mutant kinases and inhibitors of the present invention can also be used directly to treat diseases in humans and animals. Just as described above for the animal model systems, gene substitution could be used on patients with diseases which are mediated by those kinases. The wild-type gene for one or more such wild-type kinase would be deleted, e.g., by &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; methods known in the art, and then specifically inhibitable mutants of those one or more kinases would be added to the animal&apos;s genome, e.g., by &ldquo;knock-in&rdquo; or gene therapy methods which are known in the art. Then, the inhibitor could be used as a drug to down-modulate those one or more mutant kinases, such that the disease is ameliorated to at least some degree, but the degree of activity of those kinases which may be found to be necessary for normal cellular function could be maintained. Of course, the kinases could also be essentially &ldquo;turned off&rdquo; by strong inhibition, if that proved to be therapeutically effective. Furthermore, if it is found that the disease is greatly improved or cured by a period of down-regulation or being turned off, then administration of the inhibitor could be discontinued, and the disease well might not return or exacerbate. If not, then inhibition could be discontinued on a long term or even permanent basis, and the mutants could be left to function in the place of the wild-type kinase for the remainder of that patient&apos;s life. Since the specific inhibitors of the present invention are not present in the environment, the mutant kinases should behave just like the wild-type (except to the extent that the engineering may have changed their activity or kinetics). And if the disease should recur or flare up again in the future, the patient could again be treated with the inhibitor, without the need to repeat the gene exchange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Other Multi-substrate Enzymes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the present invention is not limited to mutant kinases, orthogonal inhibitors, and their synthesis and use. The present invention will work just as well for other multi-substrate enzymes which covalently transfer part or all of one substrate, here called the donor, to another substrate, here called the recipient; and there are surely more such enzymes yet to be discovered. In any such instance, one of skill in the art who has studied the present specification will well appreciate the applicability of the present invention to such enzymes. The tasks at hand in such an instance are quite similar to those described in detail here for the kinases. First, it is necessary to identify what the donor substrate is, and/or to identify compounds which can inhibit that kinase, even if it is not specific for that kinase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Second, it is necessary to consider where a bulky substitutent might be added to the substrate or the inhibitor such that it will not bind as readily to the wild-type kinase, or preferably will not bind substantially to the wild-type kinase, and preferably, will not bind at all. Of course, it is not really necessary, in the case of kinases or in other multi-substrate enzymes as described above, to be restrictive with respect to which analogs of these to make; one can make a variety of them, even including some that seem unlikely to be ideal, and determine by screening which one or ones are the best. Further guidance regarding how to do this can be gained from the examples below. The inhibition assay, the results of which are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, is a non-limiting example of an assay particularly well suited to such screening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The third step is to engineer the kinase such that one or more amino acid in the three-dimensional location where the bulky group would be expected to be if the analog did bind are replaced with amino acids having less bulky side chains, thus &ldquo;making room&rdquo; for the bulky moiety of the inhibitor. Steps two and three can, of course, be carried out in the reverse order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> For example, transferase enzymes would be most interesting candidates for study using the present invention. One could, following the teachings provided herein, prepare mutant tansferases which will accept orthogonal inhibitors, and these could be used together in order to identify the direct substrates of one particular transferase in a large family of homologous transferases, by the methods described above for the kinases. The family of methyl-transferases would be of clear interest, and could quite easily be studied using the methods provided herein. These enzymes all use the same nucleotide based cofactor, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), as a methyl (CH3) group donor. The different members of the family can transfer the methyl group of AdoMet to a wide variety of cellular components such as proteins (in which case the methyl group is added to arginine, aspartate, and glutamate side chains), DNA (in which case the methyl group is added to the C-5 position of cytosine, or the N-7 of guanine), to components of cell membrane components such as phospholipids, and also to a number of small amine containing hormones. Many new targets are also being identified for this diverse family of enzymes. The present invention provides the opportunity to decipher the tremendously complex cellular mechanisms that these enzymes are carrying out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> For example, one could synthesize a set of AdoMet analogs that contain additional bulky hydrophobic groups at the N-6 position, or at other ring positions, which would make the analogs orthogonal, and thus not be accepted as readily by wild-type methyltransferases as is the natural substrate; and the structure in the region of the transferred methyl group might be altered such that the methyl group is more chemically resistant to transfer; or, for example, S-adenosylcysteine might be used as the starting compound instead. Using the crystal structures of DNA methyltransferase M.HhaI and the catechol methyltransferase catechol O-methyl-transferase (COMT), one can identify those amino acids in the adenine binding pocket which are candidates for mutation as we have done for the protein kinases; and one of ordinary skill in the art should readily be able to identify a set of residues to mutate in order to accommodate the bulky hydrophobic groups of one or more of the orthogonal substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> For example, one might mutate large hydrophobic groups to smaller alanine or glycine residues, or replace hydrogen bonding amino acids with others that compliment the orthogonal purine analogs of AdoMet. Of course, a myriad of other possible mutations may work as well, and all would be within the scope of the present invention. In addition, from sequence alignments and crystal structures of methyltransferases, it is known that they have a common catalytic domain structure (70); so this approach is not limited to M.HhaI and COMT, but should be equally applicable to other methyl transferases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> After a methyltransferase mutant is identified which accepts an orthogonal inhibitor, radiolabeled AdoMet can then be synthesized which contains a C-14 labeled methyl group attached to the sulfur atom of AdoMet. When this radiolabeled analog is added to cells expressing one mutant methyltransferase, the direct substrates (e.g., protein or DNA, or polyamines) of all methyltransferases in the sample will be specifically radiolabeled with the C-14 methyl group. But when this is done in the presence of the orthogonal inhibitor, the specific substrates for the methyltransferase of interest will be less labeled in comparison to the sample not containing the inhibitor; preferably, they will not be substantially labeled, and most preferably, will not be labeled at all. In this way, or through the use of other methods described herein for the study of the kinases, direct substrates of methyltransferases can be identified which are important in cancer, embryonic development, chemotaxis of poly morphonuclear leukocytes, or in neurological disorders. In addition, the methods of the present invention can then be used to determining whether compounds can be identified that modulate the activity of the enzyme. The several other aspects of the present invention, although perhaps not described here, could also be applied to the methyl transferases, and also to other multi-substrate enzymes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The forgoing discussion of the application of the present invention to the methyl transferases is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, but to illustrate of the applicability of the present invention to multi-substrate enzymes other than the protein kinases. As will be appreciated by those in the art, the present invention could be applied similarly to other multi-substrate enzymes using similar approaches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Terms </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As is generally the case in biotechnology, the description of the present invention herein has required the use of a substantial number of terms of art. Although it is not practical to do so exhaustively, definitions for some of these terms are provided here for ease of reference. Definitions for other terms also appear elsewhere herein, and those are not repeated here. It is important to note that it is not intended that the terms defined here or elsewhere herein be given a meaning other than that which those skilled in the art would understand them to have when used in the field, and it is therefore urged that other sources also be consulted in interpreting the meaning of these terms and those defined elsewhere herein. However, the definitions provided here and elsewhere herein should always be considered in determining the intended scope and meaning of the defined terms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;orthogonal&rdquo; is used here to mean a compound that is similar, structurally and/or geometrically, to the natural substrate for a given enzyme, or to an inhibitor of the wild-type form of the enzyme, but has differences in chemical structure which make that compound less able to bind to the wild-type form of the enzyme than is the natural substrate. By &ldquo;natural&rdquo; substrate we mean that substrate which is utilized by the wild-type form of that enzyme. The orthogonal inhibitors of the present invention may be referred to in different ways herein; for example, sometimes they are referred to as &ldquo;modified substrates,&rdquo; &ldquo;modified inhibitors,&rdquo; &ldquo;analogs,&rdquo; &ldquo;derivatives,&rdquo; just as &ldquo;substrates,&rdquo; or &ldquo;inhibitors,&rdquo; and perhaps by other terms as well. However, in each instance, the same meaning is intended. Of course, the meaning of &ldquo;orthogonal&rdquo; and its synonyms are further explained in the descriptions of the invention provided above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The putative orthogonal substrates and inhibitors of the embodiments of the invention described herein were made by adding bulky substituents to an atom on the natural substrate or known kinase inhibitor, respectively. However, the present invention is not so limited. For example, it is possible to make an orthogonal substrate that is smaller than a known inhibitor or the natural substrate, e.g., by preparing an analog that is missing one or more atoms or substituents that are present in the natural substrate. With such putative orthogonal substrates or inhibitors, one could mutate the enzyme to contain one or more amino acids having more bulky side chains than those found in the wild-type amino acid sequence, so that when the orthogonal substrate or inhibitor binds, those more bulky amino acid side chains fill or partially fill the extra space created by the missing atoms or substituents. In this way, it would be expected that the mutant would bind to and/or be inhibited by the orthogonal substrate or inhibitor, but would not substantially utilize the normal substrate, because the added bulky amino acids present a steric hinderance to its binding. Such an approach would allow for highly selective control of the resulting mutant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> It is important to keep in mind that even though the substrates and inhibitors of the examples herein are of the non-competitive type, this should not be viewed as a limitation of the scope of the present invention. Many different types of enzyme substrates and inhibitors are known, e.g., competitive, non-competitive, uncompetitive, &ldquo;suicide&rdquo; inhibitors, etc. Competitive inhibitors compete with a substrate for its binding site; but since the inhibitor cannot participate in the catalytic reaction which that enzyme carries out, it slows down catalysis. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to the active site, but then become covalently or ionically bound to the protein structure of the enzyme, such that they cannot come off. Thus, they inhibit catalysis by taking molecules of enzyme out of the reaction altogether. More detailed descriptions of these and other competitive mechanisms can be found in a variety of sources (e.g., 72). By applying the understanding of the art regarding such mechanisms to the design of inhibitors of the present invention, all such types of inhibitors could be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> For example, an analog which can bind, but not react, would provide a competitive inhibition, and an analog which becomes covalently attached to the enzyme upon binding, would be a non-competitive inhibitor, i.e., a poison. All such types of inhibitors are within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;homologous to&rdquo; has been used to describe how information about how to modify one enzyme can be deduced from information regarding the three-dimensional structure of other, related enzymes. As those in the field well know, a part of one enzyme which is &ldquo;homologous&rdquo; to part of a second enzyme has a protein sequence which is related to that of the second enzyme. This relationship is that they have a number of amino acids in the same relative location to one another. For example, the imaginary sequence Asp-Met-Phe-Arg-Asp-Lys-Glu and the imaginary sequence Asp-Met-Ile-Arg-Glu-Lys-Asp have four amino acids in the same relative location, and three which are different, and they would be said to have homologous sequences. Note that the three amino acids that are different between the chains are &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; differences, in that the substitutions in the second sequence relative to the first are with amino acids that have similar functionalities on their side chains. For example, Glu and Arg both have aliphatic side chains terminated in carboxylic acid groups, and both Phe and Ile are hydrophobic. Although this is often the case with homologous protein sequences, it need not be the case, and these two imaginary sequences would still be considered homologous even if the differences were not conservative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Whether a particular sequence or domain is homologous to another cannot be stated with any particularity, e.g., by using percentages, as there is no such absolute yardstick; we must leave it to the art to define which sequences are and are not considered &ldquo;homologous.&rdquo; Reference 71 gives a good overview of which domains of the known kinases are considered by the art to be &ldquo;homologous.&rdquo; In addition, although the art may not generally agree, it is intended here that sequences that are identical to one another also be considered to be &ldquo;homologous&rdquo; to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;domain&rdquo; is also one well known in the art, and it refers to a region in a protein which has been identified as having a particular functionality. For example, the three domains in protein kinases have been discussed elsewhere herein, and their functional roles have been discussed. Often, as is the case with the kinases, different enzymes of the same family will have the same number of domains with each serving the same function, and they are often (but probably not always) arranged in the same order along the protein sequence. Interestingly, as is the case for the kinases, one enzyme may have a different length of protein sequence between its domains than does another. However, since the domains of two related enzymes are generally (but probably not always) homologous to one another, this does not generally hamper the identification of corresponding domains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In describing the broader aspects of the present invention, the term &ldquo;multi-substrate&rdquo; is used. This is intended to mean enzymes which bind two or more substrates. Those multi-substrate enzymes of most interest here are those which catalytically attach at least part of one substrate to at least one other substrate. The kinases and the transferases are but two families of such multi-substrate enzymes, and those of skill in the art will readily recognize that there are other such enzymes and enzyme families. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;recognize&rdquo; is sometimes used here to describe the ability of a substrate to specifically bind to the active site on an enzyme. This simply refers to the fact that an enzyme&apos;s substrate (or sometimes substrate derivatives or even completely different compounds that mimic the substrate) can contact and bind to the enzyme&apos;s active site, but other compounds will not. This concept is well known in the art. Enzymologists often say that the enzyme has an affinity for its substrate, or that the substrate has an affinity for the enzyme. They also say that an enzyme has &ldquo;substrate specificity.&rdquo; These all really describe the same phenomenon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> A related term is the term &ldquo;bind.&rdquo; An inhibitor generally binds, or sticks to, to an active site through one or more-hydrophobic, hydrophilic, hydrogen, and/or ionic bonds, or, in the case of non-competitive inhibitors, through covalent bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Although the complex understanding in the art regarding inhibitor binding and the reasons for inhibition may be of interest, such an understanding is not essential to understanding the present invention. It is sufficient to simply note that binding by an inhibitor causes inhibition of the catalytic reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;mutant&rdquo; and &ldquo;engineered form,&rdquo; when used to describe the enzymes of the present invention, simply mean that they have sequences that have a different amino acid at one or more position when compared to the sequence of the wild-type enzyme. In describing such mutants, two letters separated by a number indicate the amino acid mutations made. The letters are single-letter amino acid codes, and the numbers are the amino acid residue positions in the intact, wild-type enzyme. For example. GST-XD4 is a fusion protein containing a fragment, XD4, that has the same sequence as a specific part of the wild-type v-Src. In the designation GST-XD4(V323A, I338A), the valine in the sequence of v-Src fragment XD4 that represents position 323 in the complete wild type v-Src sequence has been replaced by alanine, and the isoleucine in the XD4 fragment that represents position 338 in the complete wild type v-Src sequence has also been replaced with alanine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> As described in the examples below, using the present invention we have designed, made and demonstrated the utility of a v-Src kinase which shows high specificity for a synthetic inhibitor while maintaining its wild-type specificity for tyrosine containing peptides and proteins, thus satisfying our initial research goals. By exploiting the highly conserved nature of the ATP binding site across the kinase superfamily and the availability of structural information from other protein kinases, we were able to engineer novel inhibition specificity for v-Src without any detailed structural information about v-Src itself. That we used an unrelated kinase as a blueprint for designing orthogonal ATP analogs to tag the direct cellular substrates of v-src. and have prepared inhibitors from like origins, demonstrates that this approach should work for other kinases as well. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Triphosphate synthesis was carried out according to the method of Ludwig (47) with the exception of the preparation of pyrophosphate.

<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> To identify compounds that would not be accepted as substrates by any existing cellular kinases (53), we screened a panel of synthetic A*TP analogs in a murine lymphocyte lysate (CF) rich in protein tyrosine kinases(13). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> The assays were performed using spleenocytes (8-30 week old male and female C57/B6 mice from the Princeton University Animal Facility) which were isolated and washed in RPMI-1640 medium containing 5% Bovine Calf Serum (BCS), 1% Hepes and DNAseI (1 &mgr;g/ml). Red cells were lysed at 4&deg; C. by treatment with 17 mM tris ammonium chloride pH 7.2. The cells were hypotonically lysed on ice for 10 min. in 1 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, leupeptin (10 &mgr;g/ml), aprotinin (10 &mgr;g/ml) and 100 &mgr;M PMSF according to the method of Fukazawa et al. (51). After vortexing and centrifugation at 500&times;g, the supernatant was collected. Cells were stored at 4&deg; C. for 20 min. to attenuate the basal protein phosphorylation level, after which the buffer was adjusted to 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 1 mM NaF. Sodium vanadate (100 &mgr;M) was then added to inhibit the activity of phosphotyrosine phosphatases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Each nucleotide triphosphate was added to a final concentration of 100 &mgr;M to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cell equivalents and incubated at 37&deg; C. for 5 min. after which 4&times; Laemmli gel loading buffer was added to the cell lysate to quench the reaction. Proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Protran BA85 (Schleicher-Schuell). The blot was probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) and the bound antibody was detected via enhanced chemiluminescence (cat. 34080, Pierce) following treatment with HRP-coupled goat-anti-mouse antibody (VWR cat. 7101332) according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is an anti-phosphotyrosine protein immunoblot showing the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment of a murine lymphocyte cell lysate (CF) with 100 &mgr;M of ATP or A*TPs (1-12). The cell lysate used includes the tyrosine kinases Src, Fyn, Lck, Lyn, Yes, Fgr, Hck, Zap, Syk. Btk, Blk, and other tyrosine kinases present in B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, and follicular dendritic cells (13). Molecular size standards (in kilodaltons) are indicated. The A*TPs containing the smallest 6 substituents, 1 (methoxy), 2 (ethoxy), and 3 (acetyl) showed some ability to serve as cellular tyrosine kinase substrates (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, lanes 3-5). The A*TPs with sterically demanding N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>substituents, 4 (i-propoxy), 5 (benzyl), and 6 (benzyloxy), and all analogs containing cyclic aliphatic substituents (7-12) showed little or no protein phosphorylation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, lanes 6-8, 11-16). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> To test for possible metathesis of orthogonal A*TPs (7-12) with cellular ADP to give A*DP and ATP, we added 1 mM ADP to cell lysate kinase reactions identical to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>; (data not shown); the pattern of phosphoproteins was the same, indicating that no significant metathesis of A*TP occurs in a complete cell lysate system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Based upon these results, it appears that analogs (7-12) are &ldquo;dead substrates&rdquo; for wild type tyrosine kinases, i.e., the wild-type substrates do not substantially, or at all, accept these as phosphate donor substrate. These analogs thus were chosen as the most preferred targets for reengineering the nucleotide binding site of v-Src. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> No crystal structures of any tyrosine kinases in an active conformation have been solved to date although several structures of inactive kinases have been solved (54,55). However, two crystal structures of catalytically active ser/thr kinases have been solved (56,57). There is a high degree of functional homology between the ser/thr and the tyrosine kinase catalytic domains as shown by affinity labeling of the identical catalytically active lysine residue in both kinase families (K72 in cAMP dependent kinase (PKA), K295 in v-Src) (58,58). Inspection of the PKA (56) and cyclin dependent kinase-2 (CDK2)-cyclinA (57) crystal structures revealed two amino acid side chains within a 4 &angst; sphere of the N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>amino group of bound ATP: V104/M120 (PKA) and V64/F80 (CDK2) (60). </paragraph>

The remainder of the protein is shown in ribbon format. This figure was created by feeding the output of Molscript into the Raster3D rendering program (68,69). Note that in the model, the side chain of Glu121 is pointed away from the adenine ring binding region, and therefore Glu121 was not a candidate for alteration. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Expression and purification of the GST fusion kinases were carried out in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain DH5&agr; as described by Xu et al (50), with the exception that the cells were stored at 4&deg; C. overnight prior to centrifugation and lysis by French press (overnight storage is essential for producing highly active kinases). </paragraph>

Briefly, the 6-His-XD4 and 6-His-XD4 (V323A, I338 &angst;) genes were generated by PCR using the corresponding pGEX vectors as templates with primers SEQ. ID NO. 4 and SEQ. ID NO. 5, followed by digestion with BamH1 and EcoR1. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pFASTBAC which had been digested with BamH1 and EcoR1. Transformation of HB10BAC cells and subsequent transfection of Sf9 cells with the Bacmid containing XD4 or XD4 (V323A, I338A) were carried out as suggested by the manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> In an alternate procedure performed herein, transfection of v-src or v-src(I338G) mutant kinase was performed by cloning the v-src gene from the pGEX-v-Src vector(4) into the pBabe vector(5) which contains the ltr promotor for high level of expression in NIH 3T3 cells. The pBabe v-Src (I338G) plasmid was transfected into viral packaging cell line BOSC 23(6) and viral particles harvested after 2 days as described(6). NIH 3T3 cells were infected as described(7) with these viral particles and stable transfectants were selected in puromycin containing media as described(5). Stable transfectants were maintained in media containing puromycin to ensure no loss of expression of v-Src. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The final results are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is a diagram showing the domain structure of v-Src including the Src-homology 3, 2, and 1 (SH3, SH2 &amp; SH1) domains, with the domain boundaries indicated by the amino acid residue numbers listed above each boxed domain. The domain structure of XD4 is also represented, which contains a deletion of residues 77-225 (&Dgr;77-225). Domain organizations of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion with XD4 (numbering from v-Src), and the doubly mutated GST-XD4(representing both V323A,I338A and I338G) are also shown schematically. </paragraph>

In contrast, the doubly mutated GST-XD4(V323A, I338A) shows excellent inhibition by more sterically demanding N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>substituted ATP analogs (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, shaded bars). Most significantly, the GST-XD4(V323A, I338A) mutant is inhibited by ATP analogs 5, 8, 9, and 11 almost as well as the wild-type kinase, GST-XD4, is inhibited by its natural substrate ATP. We have confirmed that GST-XD4(V323A, I338A) and the full length GST-v-Src(V323A, I338A) display the same inhibition pattern with A*TPs (1-12) (data not shown). </paragraph>

This high success rate in identifying new substrates for a mutant v-Src which are not accepted by wild-type kinases suggests that we have identified a key feature of the v-Src nucleotide binding site, namely the residues which make a close fit around the N<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>amino group of ATP. It is worth noting that we know of no wild-type protein kinases which contain an alanine at the position corresponding to I338 in v-Src (position 120 in PKA). If a sterically demanding amino acid side chain at this position also plays a critical role in determining the specificity of other kinases, it should well be possible to engineer them to accept orthogonal substrates using an approach very similar to the one described here, and such engineered kinases would be well within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The parameter used to rank catalysts for competing substrates is the ratio of the turnover number to the Michaelis-Menten constant, k<highlight><subscript>cat</subscript></highlight>/K<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>(the &ldquo;specificity constant&rdquo;) (64).

At saturating concentrations of &lsqb;&ggr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb; ATP the wild-type and the mutant display essentially the same K<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>for RR-Src, 2.6&plusmn;0.9 mM and 3.1&plusmn;0.9 mM, respectively (63). In addition, the K<highlight><subscript>M </subscript></highlight>of the mutant for the protein substrate in the presence of saturating amounts of the orthogonal substrate was also essentially the same, 2.1&plusmn;0.9 mM. These findings suggest that the alanine mutations in the ATP binding pocket, which is proximal to the adjacent phospho-acceptor binding site, do not affect the protein target specificity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> In support of this, the engineered kinase phosphorylates the same broad set of proteins that are phosphorylated by wild-type XD4 when each is expressed in Sf9 insect cells.

<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The Sf9 insect cell system is a good host for expressing small amounts of tyrosine kinases because these cells contain most of the same machinery necessary to carry out post-translational modifications to proteins resulting in kinases which are more similar in activity to those found in mammalian cells. Furthermore, uninfected Sf9 cells lack endogenous tyrosine kinase activity, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), lane 1, and thus the phosphotyrosine containing proteins in lanes 2 and 3 of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) are substrates of the expressed 6-His-XD4 or mutant 6-His-XD4 kinases. We attribute the small differences in phosphorylation level of particular proteins to the lower catalytic activity of the mutant XD4 (V323A, I338A) compared to the wild-type kinase. </paragraph>

The gel lanes shown on the top left of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> show that the mutant with alanine at the 338 position was able to utilize the natural substrate, ATP, more readily than the mutant with serine at that same position. The gel lanes shown on the bottom left of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> show that the mutant with alanine in position 338 is also better able to use ATP as a substrate than is the mutant with glycine at that position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The panels on the right side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> tell an even more interesting story.

<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> These results are most promising. It appears that a single mutation is enough to allow the use of this orthogonal substrate.

<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> Deconvoluting protein kinase signaling pathways using conventional genetic and biochemical approaches has been difficult due to the overwhelming number of closely related kinases. If cell permeable inhibitors of each individual kinase could be designed, the role of each protein kinase could be systematically assessed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Results: We have devised an approach combining chemistry and genetics to develop the first uniquely specific cell permeable inhibitor of the oncogenic protein tyrosine kinase, v-Src. A functionally silent active site mutation was made in v-Src in order to distinguish it from all other cellular kinases. A tight binding (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;430 nM) cell permeable inhibitor of this mutant kinase was designed and synthesized which does not inhibit wild-type kinases. In vitro and whole cell assays established the unique specificity of the mutant v-Src/inhibitor pair. This inhibitor reverses the transforming effects of cellular expression of the engineered v-Src, but does not disrupt wild type v-Src mediated cellular transformation. These cell lines differ only by a single amino acid in a single protein kinase, establishing that dramatic changes in cellular signaling can be directly attributed to specific inhibition of the engineered kinase. The generality of this method was tested by engineering another tyrosine kinase, Fyn, to contain the corresponding silent mutation. The same compound was found to be a potent inhibitor (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;830 nM) of this mutant kinase as well, confirming the generality of the strategy toward making allele specific inhibitors of multiple tyrosine kinases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Conclusions: Allele specific cell permeable inhibitors of individual Src family kinases can be rapidly developed using a combined chemical and genetic approach. Treatment of mutant v-Src transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with a uniquely specific v-Src reverts the morphological hallmarks of transformation. The inhibitor exhibits no effect on cells transformed by the wild-type v-Src allele strongly suggesting that the phenotype induced by inhibitor treatment is a result of a single inhibitory event. The ability to rapidly generate kinase specific inhibitors in a generalizable way will be useful for deconvolution of kinase mediated cellular pathways and for validating novel kinases as good targets for drug discovery both in vitro and in vivo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> As stated earlier, a combined chemical and genetic strategy has been devised which allows for the generation of &ldquo;chemical sensitive&rdquo; mutant kinases which are uniquely inhibited by a rationally designed small molecule inhibitor. Our approach involves engineering a unique pocket in the active site of the kinase of interest with a functionally silent mutation. A specific inhibitor of the engineered kinase is then synthesized by derivatizing a known kinase inhibitor with a bulky group designed to fit the novel active site pocket. The bulky group kills the potency of the inhibitor for wild type kinases. Successful complementary design, therefore, leads to favorable binding interactions that are only possible in the engineered kinase/inhibitor complex. Transfection of cells with the gene encoding the engineered kinase generates a cell in which only one kinase can be blocked by the designed inhibitor (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Importantly, since the mutant kinase serves the same function as the wild-type kinase, an inhibitor of the mutant will affect cell signaling in the same manner as a selective inhibitor of the wild-type kinase in non-transfected cells. The ability to observe the phenotype of cells after selective inhibition of any protein kinase provides a rapid method for determining the unique roles of individual kinases in signal transduction cascades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> We have targeted the src family protein tyrosine kinases for specific inhibitor design because of their ubiquitous importance in mediating cell function . Despite intense investigation, the roles of individual src family members have been difficult to assess because of cellular co-localization and their high sequence identities. Although some potent inhibitors of src family kinases are known . no molecules which can effectively discriminate ((20 fold selectivity for one src family member) between these closely related enzymes have been identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Two functionally important src kinases, v-Src and Fyn, were chosen as the primary targets of our mutant kinase/inhibitor pair design. Src kinase has emerged as a leading drug target because of its implication in the oncogenesis of breast, lung, and colon cancers . Although v-Src is the prototype for oncogenic tyrosine kinases, no small molecule inhibitors which are highly selective for this kinase have been discovered . Fyn is a src family tyrosine kinase which is important in T cell receptor mediated lymphocyte activation . Src and Fyn share a similar domain structure and have approximately 85% amino acid identity in their catalytic domains . The close structural relationship of the src family members provides the ideal test of our ability to engineer enzyme/inhibitor specificity between highly homologous kinases. If one can discriminate between these closely related src members using a cell permeable inhibitor, it is likely that specificity for members of other protein kinase families can also be achieved using a similar approach. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> From our previous efforts to engineer kinases with novel ATP specificity, we identified a functionally conserved residue in the ATP binding pocket of v-Src (Ile 338) which could be mutated to glycine without altering the phosphoacceptor specificity or biological function of the kinase. The space creating mutation causes only a modest drop in k<highlight><subscript>cat </subscript></highlight>a modest increase in the K<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>for ATP and no quantitative change in the level of fibroblast transformation (Shah K, unpublished results). The biological substrates of the mutant v-Src are unchanged and I338G v-Src carries out the same biological functions as wild type v-Src. All crystal structures of ATP bound protein kinases have revealed a close contact interaction between the residue corresponding to 338 (Src numbering) and ATP . Analysis of protein kinase sequence alignments confirmed that residue 338 contains a bulky side chain (usually Thr, Ile, Leu, Met, or Phe) in all known eukaryotic protein kinases . Thus, a glycine mutation at the 338 position should create a novel pocket that is not present in any wild type kinase. Due to the expanded ATP binding site, the glycine mutant kinases should accept bulky inhibitors that could not bind wild type kinases. Using standard methods we cloned, expressed and purified the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the WT and I338G v-Src catalytic domains as described previously . WT Fyn, T339G Fyn (Src numbering), and WT Abl were also expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Inhibitor Design and Synthesis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> To test our basic design strategy we screened the WT and I338G v-Src SH1 domains against a previously synthesized panel of N-6 substituted adenosine molecules for selective inhibition of I338G v-Src over WT v-Src. Because adenosine is only a moderate inhibitor of src family tyrosine kinases, we did not expect to discover a potent inhibitor of the engineered kinase. As expected, all of the N-6 adenosine analogues inhibited I338G v-Src more potently than WT v-Src (data not shown). The most potent inhibitor found in this screen was N-6 cyclopentyloxyadenosine (1, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a.</italic></highlight>) with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>) of 1 mM for I338G v-Src. Subsequent experiments to test for selectivity demonstrated that N-6 cyclopentyloxyadenosine showed no detectable in vitro inhibition of WT v-Src or Fyn at concentrations up to 400 mM. This first screen encouraged us to pursue the strategy of developing novel inhibitors of I338G v-Src since our design had allowed us to readily over come selectivity barriers which are major problems in conventional inhibitor discovery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> As inhibitors, adenosine analogues are not ideal because of the many cellular functions performed by adenosine as well as the large number of cellular proteins which bind adenosine. N-6 adenosine analogues have been shown to act as adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists, and one can imagine N-6 adenosine analogues acting as substrates for nucleoside kinases. For these reasons we turned to a class of known tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are not direct analogues of biologically known molecules. Our design strategy called for a core structure which exhibits potent inhibition of multiple wild type kinases and is easily synthesized. Also, the binding orientation of the molecule in the enzyme active site must be known or readily predictable. In addition, the molecule must bind in a manner in which the site pointing toward Ile338 can be easily modified. As our core inhibitor structure we chose 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-phenylpyrazolo &lsqb;3,4-d&rsqb;pyrimidine (2, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b.</italic></highlight>). This molecule is a derivative of 4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(p-methylphenyl)pyrazolo&lsqb;3,4-d&rsqb;pyrimidine (PP 1) which was reported by Hanke and co-workers as a potent src family kinase inhibitor. Based on the co-crystal structure of the src family kinase, Hck, bound to the general kinase inhibitor, quercetin (5, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>), we postulated that 2 binds to src family kinases in a conformation similar to that of ATP. The predicted binding orientation of 2 in Hck is shown in an overlay with the known Hck co-crystal structures of AMP PNP (6) and quercetin (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b.</italic></highlight>). In this conformation the easily derivatizable N4 position of 2 corresponds to the N-6 of ATP (close contact with residue 338, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c.</italic></highlight>) and the tert-butyl moiety roughly corresponds to the ribose ring of ATP. We further hypothesized that in this orientation, the C-3 phenyl ring of 2 could bind in a pocket that surrounds the N-7 of ATP as seen in the Hck/quercetin co-crystal structure . This analysis lead us to synthesize a small panel of N-4 derivatized analogues of 2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Identification of a Uniquely Selective Inhibitor </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> The panel of pyrazolo&lsqb;3,4-d&rsqb;pyrimidines was screened against WT and I338G v-Src kinases (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). All of the analogues are better inhibitors of the engineered v-Src as compared to wild type, confirming our prediction of the binding orientation of 2 in the kinase active site. Any derivatization of 2 at the N-4 position destroys the inhibitory activity against WT v-Src (no detectable inhibition at the limit of solubility, 300 mM). All 10 analogues demonstrated measurable inhibition of I338G v-Src and several of the compounds have IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&apos;s in the low mM range. The N-4-(p-tert-butyl)benzoyl analogue (3 g) is the most potent inhibitor of I338G v-Src in the panel (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;430 nm). This molecule shows no inhibition of WT v-Src at 300 mM suggesting that 3 g is at least a 1000 fold better inhibitor of the mutant v-Src as compared to wild type. The large size of the derivatization needed to achieve sub-micromolar potency for the I338G v-Src active site was rather unexpected. We removed only four carbon atoms from the ATP binding site and derivatized the parent molecule with eleven carbon atoms. This discrepancy may be due to an imperfection in our binding prediction . Also the Ile to Gly mutation may confer greater flexibility to the enzyme active site allowing the mutant kinase to accept a larger inhibitor analogue than predicted. To confirm that 3 g does inhibit I338G v-src at the ATP binding site we investigated its kinetics of inhibition at various ATP concentrations. Lineweaver-Burk analysis confirmed that 3 g does inhibit I338G v-Src competitively with respect to ATP with an inhibitory constant (K) of approximately 400 nM (data not shown), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The panel of inhibitor analogues was next screened against WT Fyn to investigate their potential to cross react with this kinase. WT Fyn was chosen as the &ldquo;worst case&rdquo; control of wild type kinases because the published parent molecule, PP1, and 2 are highly potent (low nM) Fyn inhibitors . Many of the 10 synthetic analogues did not display high selectivity for the target kinase (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). The N-acyl analogues with saturated ring systems (3a-3c) effectively inhibit wild type Fyn. The N-methylene compounds (4b, 4d, 4e) are sufficiently orthogonal to WT Fyn but show only poor to moderate inhibition of the engineered v-Src. Importantly, 3 g, the most potent inhibitor of the mutant v-Src inhibited WT Fyn very weakly (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&equals;300 mM). Thus, 3 g inhibits the engineered v-Src over 700 times more effectively than WT Fyn, which is likely to be the wild type cellular kinase which is most capable of binding the molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> We also tested whether other non-src family kinases were fortuitously inhibited by 3 g in vitro. The serine/threonine kinases, PKCd and PKA, were not detectably inhibited at concentrations up to 300 mM. Likewise, 3 g exhibited only weak inhibition (IC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>&gt;300 mM) of the Abl tyrosine kinase. Therefore 3 g satisfied all of our initial design requirements for potent selective inhibition of one engineered kinase. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> To further demonstrate that 3 g does not inhibit wild type tyrosine kinases we investigated the effects of 3 g treatment on the B cell receptor (BCR) mediated phosphorylation cascade. Src family (Fyn. Lyn. Lck. Blk) and non-src family tyrosine kinases (Btk. Syk) are known to be activated upon BCR cross-linking. Due to the amplifying nature of the BCR mediated cascade, inhibition of any of these kinases would dramatically alter the distribution and intensity of post-activation cellular phosphotyrosine . Because 3 g was designed to be sterically incompatible with the active sites of wild type kinases, it should not disrupt tyrosine phosphorylation dependent signaling in wild type B cells. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> (lane 3) demonstrates that 100 mM 3 g treatment of antigen receptor cross linked murine B cells has no effect on the phosphotyrosine pattern of B cell stimulation (compare to lane 2). The signal intensities of all the major bands are unchanged and only slight depletion of some minor bands is detectable. confirming that 3 g does not appreciably inhibit the panel of tyrosine kinases that are activated by BCR cross linking. Treatment of B cells with 100 mM 2, however, causes a significant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, lane 4) that is consistent with its potent inhibition of wild type src family kinases . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> Selective Inhibition of I338G v-Src in NIH3T3 Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In order to use our selective inhibitor to study a Src mediated pathway we retrovirally introduced both WT and I338G v-Src into NIH3T3 fibroblasts. These cells acquire a transformed phenotype which is dependent on v-Src expression. We sought to show that 3 g could selectively disturb the Src dependent signal transduction pathway of I338G v-Src transformed cells while not affecting WT transformed cells. Treatment of WT v-Src infected cells (100 mM 3 g) causes no loss of tyrosine phosphorylation compared to control DMSO treated lanes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>), demonstrating that the designed inhibitor does not inhibit WT v-Src or any of the other tyrosine kinases that are activated by v-Src mediated cellular transformation. Equivalent treatment of I338G v-Src transformed cells gives rise to a dramatic diminution in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the putative v-Src substrate, p36, as well as a moderate overall decrease in the cellular level of phosphotyrosine. Previously, it has been shown that treatment of v-Src transformed cells with general tyrosine kinase inhibitors causes a reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 36kD protein. It is thought that p36 is associated with a specific phosphotyrosine phosphatase, possibly explaining its rapid dephosphorylation in inhibitor treated cells . The 3 g IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>for p36 phosphotyrosine signal in I338G v-Src expressing cells ((50 mM) is roughly 100 times the in vitro value (data not shown). This is presumably due to the fact that the inhibitor must compete with millimolar concentrations of ATP for the kinase active site in the cellular experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Selective Inhibition of I338G Mutant v-Src Reverses Transformed Cell Morphology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> V-Src activity is required for Rous sarcoma virus transformation of mammalian cells. Treatment of the I338G v-Src expressing NIH 3T3 cells with 100 mM 3 g caused dramatic changes in cell morphology which are consistent with the reversal of transformation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>). The mutant cells that were treated with inhibitor 3 g appeared flat and did not exhibit growth characteristics of transformed cells (i.e. the ability to grow on top of one another). Under identical conditions, WT v-Src infected cells demonstrated the prototypical rounded morphology and overlapping growth patterns of transformed cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> To further demonstrate the selective reversal of cell morphology we used fluorescence microscopy to view 3 g treated cells after staining the cellular polymerized actin with phalloidin-FITC wig 19). Non-transformed NIH3T3 cells show long actin spindles that form across the cells. V-Src transformed cells (both WT and I338G) appear rounded with no discernible pattern of actin formation. In agreement with the light microscopy data, inhibitor treated WT v-Src expressing cells appear indistinguishable from untreated WT cells. However, 3 g treated I338G v-Src expressing cells have defined polymerized actin strings, strongly resembling the actin formations of non-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts. These inhibitor treated cells have an exaggerated flattened morphology and show peripheral actin staining that is not present in the non-transforned NIH3T3 cells, This data shows that 3 g can uniquely induce morphological changes in cells which are engineered to contain a single amino acid change in the kinase of interest. This is the first demonstration that a small molecule inhibitor selective for a tyrosine kinase oncogene product can revert the morphological changes associated with cellular transformation. Previous examples of morphological reversion of transformation by herbimycin A (and other benzoquinone ansamycins) have recently been shown to operate via a mechanism unrelated to kinase inhibition consisting of heat shock protein (hsp90) mediated targeting of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase to the proteasome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Generalization to Other Kinases </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> The advantage of using mutagenesis to provide a unique molecular difference between the enzyme of interest and all others is that, due to the conserved kinase fold, the approach should be extendible across the kinase superfamily. Almost all known protein kinases contain a bulky side chain at the position corresponding to residue 338 of v-Src. Therefore a space creating mutation at this position should render multiple kinases susceptible to selective inhibition. To test this we measured the inhibition of the analogues against T339G Fyn (Table 1). There exists a striking similarity in the structure activity relationships of the analogues for I338G v-Src and T339G Fyn. In agreement with the data for I338G v-Src, 3 g was the most potent inhibitor analogue against T339G Fyn, exhibiting an IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>of 830 nM. This corresponds to greater than 300 fold selectivity for T339G Fyn over WT Fyn. The implication of this data is that multiple tyrosine kinases can be systematically engineered to preferentially accept one inhibitor analogue without the need to screen large libraries of putative inhibitors. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> In this report we describe a novel approach to selective protein kinase inhibition through the complementary engineering of chemical sensitive kinases and rationally designed inhibitors. We demonstrate that high selectivity for the target kinase can be achieved in whole cells, and that active site inhibition of an oncogenic tyrosine kinase can be sufficient for the disruption of a transformed cell morphology. Because the approach is easily generalized, it should have far reaching applications in deconvoluting signal transduction pathways as well as validation of kinases as targets for drug design. The pace of effective drug discovery is limited by the identification and validation of important drug targets. This is not a trivial problem in a milieu of 2000 homologous proteins. The use of chemical sensitive mutants of protein kinases expands the capability to probe the cellular and physiological effects of pharmacological kinase inhibition. Since transfected cell lines and even &ldquo;knock-in&rdquo; mice can now be generated rapidly, our approach should greatly expedite the process of testing the effects of selective inhibition of a given kinase in a whole cell or animal model. As more inhibitor-bound protein kinase crystal structures become available, this strategy will allow for the systematic investigation of the effects of time and dose dependent inhibition of any given kinase in the scope of an entire signal transduction cascade. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> This could be carried out as described in (79). Further, the stereo typed role of v-Src in the oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells can be determined by observing the morphological change in cells expressing v-Src. The NIH 3T3 cells expressing mutant I338G v-Src display the identical morphological features of cells expressing wild-type v-Src which are dramatically distinct from NIH 3T3 cells which do not express either v-Src kinase, confirming that the I338G mutation does not lead to any loss or gain of biological function of normal v-Src. Further, an assay for the ability of NIH 3T3 cells to grow without &ldquo;contact inhibition&rdquo; can be measured in a cell culture based assay containing agarose, a viscous growth medium. The wild-type v-Src and mutant v-Src expressing NIH 3T3 cells display the exact same ability to form large growth colonies in this stereotyped assay as well, further confirming their identical functions (including substrate specificity, kinetics, cell distribution, etc.) In fibroblasts. </paragraph>

As discussed in Example 7, the two left lanes in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> show the same phosphoprotein band pattern indicating that the orthogonal inhibitor 3 does not inhibit wild type v-Src kinase. The series of lanes in the right gel show a prominent band in the bottom of the gel (corresponding to protein molecular weight 3 kilodaltons) which is lost after treatment with 100 &mgr;M of compound 3. This specific inhibition of one phosphoprotein is a hallmark of a specific kinase inhibitor. The specificity of the inhibition is confirmed in the last lanes of the gel where the inhibitor is diluted and the phosphorylation of the 36 kilodalton band reappears when the inhibitor concentration is lower that 5 &mgr;M (the measured IC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>in vitro is 5 &mgr;M, see text). This protein has been tentatively identified based on its unique molecular weight, as a protein called annexin II, an actin binding protein, of unknown function. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for selectively treating selected regions of an individual biological cell, and more particularly to systems and techniques utilizing laminar flow channel systems for such treatment. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Complex behavior of cells, for example mitosis, growth, movement, metabolism, differentiation, apoptosis, etc. reflect integration of processes occurring in separate micro domains. Investigation of such behaviors require methods for delivering reagents to and/or into cells with subcellular resolution. Currently available techniques now used for micro manipulation of cells, for example micro injection, manipulation using mechanical or optical systems, etc., can, in some instances, provide subcellular resolution, but suffer from various limitations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, micro manipulation techniques, such as the use of optical tweezers (Ashkin, A. and Dziedzic, J. M., &ldquo;Internal cell manipulation using infrared laser traps,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>vol. 86, 7914-7918 (1989), can provide limited subcellular spatial resolution, but such techniques are limited in their molecular specificity. Microinjection techniques can provide molecular specificity; however, they lack spatial control due to the rapid diffusion of small molecules within the cell. In addition, techniques such as microinjection also require physical disruption of the cell plasma membrane in order to provide reagents to the interior of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic systems utilizing a multi-component laminar flow stream have been employed to create microfluidic sensor systems. Such microfluidic sensor systems are described, for example in Weigl, B. H. and Yager, P., &ldquo;Microfluidic Diffusion-based Separation and Detection,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>283, 346-347 (1999). Kennis et al., &ldquo;Micro Fabrication Inside Capillaries Using Multi Phase Laminar Flow Patterning&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>Science, </italic></highlight>Vol. 285 (1999) describes the use of a laminar flow based microfluidic system for fabricating microstructures in capillaries. Takayama, et al., &ldquo;Patterning Cells and Their Environment Using Multiple Laminar Fluid Flows and Capillary Networks,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>Vol. 96 (1999) describes using similar laminar flow based microfluidic networks to facilitate the spatial patterning of cells on a substrate and to provide a selected fluid environment to cells attached to a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Laminar flow occurs when two or more streams having a certain characteristic (low Reynolds number) are joined into a single, multi-component stream, also characterized by a low Reynolds number, such that the components are made to flow parallel to each other without turbulent mixing. The flow of liquids in small capillaries often is laminar. For a discussion of laminar flow and a definitions of the Reynolds number, the reader is referred to any of a large number of treatises and articles related to the art of fluid mechanics, for example, see Kovacs, G. T. A., &ldquo;Micromachined Transducers Sourcebook,&rdquo; WCB/McGraw-Hill, Boston (1998); Brody, J. P., Yager, P., Goldstein, R. E. and Austin, R. H., &ldquo;Biotechnology at Low Reynolds Numbers,: <highlight><italic>Biophys. J, </italic></highlight>71, 3430-3441 (1996); Vogel, S., &ldquo;Life in Moving Fluids,&rdquo; Princeton University, Princeton (1994); and Weigl, B. H. and Yager, P., &ldquo;Microfluidic Diffusion-based Separation and Detection,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>283, 346-347 (1999), each incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Analytical chemical techniques have utilized laminar flow to control the positioning of fluid streams relative to each other. U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,852 (Yager et al.), describes a chemical sensor including a channel-cell system for detecting the presence and/or measuring the presence of analytes in a sample stream. The system includes a laminar flow channel with two inlets in fluid connection with the laminar flow channel for conducting an indicator stream and a sample stream into the laminar flow channel, respectively. The indicator stream includes an indicator substance to detect the presence of the analyte particles upon contact. The laminar flow channel has a depth sufficiently small to allow laminar flow of the streams and length sufficient to allow particles of the analyte to diffuse into the indicator stream to form a detection area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,629 (Meserol et al.), discusses laminar flow in a description of apparatus for facilitating reaction between an analyte in a sample and a test reagent system. At least one of the sample and test reagent system is a liquid, and is placed in a reservoir, the other being placed in a capillary dimensioned for entry into the reservoir. Entry of the capillary into the reservoir draws, by capillary attraction, the liquid from the reservoir into the capillary to bring the analyte and test reagent system into contact to facilitate reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A variety of references describe small-volume fluid flow for a variety of purposes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,222,808 (Sugarman et al.), describes a capillary mixing device to allow mixing to occur in capillary spaces while avoiding the design constraints imposed by close-fitting, full-volume mixing bars. Mixing is facilitated by exposing magnetic or magnetically inducible particles, within the chamber, to a moving magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,300,779 (Hillman et al.), describes a capillary flow device including a chamber, a capillary, and a reagent involved in a system for providing a detectable signal. The device typically calls for the use of capillary force to draw a sample into an internal chamber. A detectable result occurs in relation to the presence of an analyte in the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> International Patent Publication No. WO 97/33737, published Mar. 15, 1996 by Kim et al., describes modification of surfaces via fluid flow through small channels, including capillary fluid flow.

<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Typical prior art techniques employed for selectively treating single cells or supplying an active substance to the interior of a biological cell are unable to create long-term intracellular gradients, particularly of small molecules (e.g. those with molecular weights less than about 600 and having diffusion coefficients within the cell of more than about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s). Microinjection studies and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies have shown that such small molecules will diffuse throughout the cytoplasm or myoplasm of a typical mammalian cell attached to a substrate (e.g., an attached mammalian cell having a maximum spread dimension of about 130 &mgr;m) within seconds the intracellular distribution of the molecules will reach 95% of an equilibrium distribution (i.e., there will be no region within the interior of the cell having a concentration of the molecule differing from another region of the cell by more than about 5%) within about 2 to about 5 minutes, even in the presence of some reversible binding of the molecule to immobilized cellular components, which binding tends to decrease the apparent diffusion coefficient (e.g. see Mastro, A. M., Babich, M. A., Taylor, W. D., and Keith, A. D., &ldquo;Diffusion of small molecules in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>Vol. 81, 3414-3418 (1984); and Blatter, L. A. and Wier, W.

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Bradke and Dotti, &ldquo;The Role of Local Actin Instability in Axon Formation,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Science</italic></highlight>, Vol. 283, 1999, describe a micropipetting technique for selectively treating a region of an axon of a neuron with a cytoskeletal disrupting substance. The technique described utilizes selectively positioned micropipettes to direct a flow of liquid containing the cytoskeletal disrupting substance such that it impinges upon a portion of the axon extending away from the main body portion of the cell. By using this technique, the actin cytoskeleton in the region of the axon upon which the fluid impinges can be selectively depolymerized. The technique described, however, is only able to create a flowing fluid over a portion of the cell, with the rest of the cell submerged in quiescent fluid. Also, the micropipetted fluid will have a tendency to undergo convective mixing with the quiescent fluid surrounding the cell, making the technique potentially poorly suited for selectively treating parts of the main body portion of the cell. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to techniques for selectively contacting a portion of the surface of a biological cell with a fluid or fluid component carrying a particular potential for a biophysical or biochemical interaction with the cell, and simultaneously contacting a different portion of the surface of the cell with another fluid or fluid component having a different potential for the biophysical or biochemical interaction with the cell. In addition to contacting a single cell with two fluid components, as described above, it should be understood, and is described in more detail below, that the cell may be contacted with a plurality of such fluid components, for example, three, four, five, or more of such fluid components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Biophysical or biochemical interactions that occur at or within a region or portion of a cell interior or surface of a cell to an extent different from another region or portion can occur at at least a 5% difference, 10% difference, 20%, 30%, 40% difference, or other percentage difference, up to a 100% difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, at least one of the fluids or fluid components that makes contact with a portion of the cell, as described above, is a flowing stream of fluid, and in the most preferred embodiments, each of the fluids or fluid components in contact with the cell are configured as flowing streams. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cell is selectively exposed to multiple components of a fluid by establishing a flowing stream of a fluid against the surface of the cell, where the flowing stream includes at least a first and second component, and in some embodiments more than a first and second component, in contact with first and second portions of the cell, respectively, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; as used herein refers to essentially any fluent material in a liquid, gas, and/or supercritical state. Typically, for the embodiments wherein the fluid is in contact with a portion of a biological cell, the fluid will comprise an aqueous liquid, which is physiologically compatible with the cell, for example, a physiological media or buffer. A &ldquo;stream&rdquo; of a fluid, as used herein, refers to a flowing fluid having a continuous, non-physically separated, wetted cross-section (i.e., configured as a single continuous stream as opposed to two or more separated streams that are not adjacent and in contact with each other). In particularly preferred embodiments, described in more detail below in the context of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the flowing stream of fluid is contained within a conduit of a microfluidic flow system or network having at least one surface thereof on which an at least one cell, and typically a plurality of cells, is attached (e.g. see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 3B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;component&rdquo; of a fluid or flowing fluid stream, or, equivalently, a &ldquo;fluid stream&rdquo; when used in the contact of at least two such streams flowing parallel, adjacent, and in contact to each other, or, similarly, a &ldquo;first fluid&rdquo;, &ldquo;second fluid&rdquo;, etc., when used in the context of describing a particular region of a physically continuous body of fluid in contact with a portion of the cell surface refers to a region of the fluid or fluid stream that is characterized by at least one bulk property which differs from, and is in non-equilibrium with respect to, a similar bulk property of another component of the fluid in contact with the cell surface. A &ldquo;bulk property&rdquo; is determined as the average value of the particular property over the cross-section, taken perpendicular to the direction of flow for flowing streams, of the component. The property can be any property which, as described above, is able to carry a potential for a biophysical or biochemical interaction with the cell. The property can be a chemical and/or physical property such as, for example, the presence or absence of a particular solvent and/or dissolved solute/substance; a concentration of solute/substance; temperature; velocity, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Adjacent&rdquo; components, fluids, or streams are those positioned next to and in contact with each other. Such adjacent components are typically characterized by a region of discontinuity in the spatial distribution of at least one property, the region of discontinuity defining an &ldquo;interface&rdquo; or &ldquo;boundary&rdquo; between the components. For one example, a fluid stream can have a first component with a first bulk concentration of a substance, which is essentially uniform throughout the cross-section of the first component, and an adjacent, second component with a second bulk concentration of the substance, which is essentially evenly or uniformly distributed within the cross-section of the second component, with an interface/boundary between the components characterized by a gradient of the substance caused by diffusional mixing between the adjacent components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In general, and as discussed in more detail below, in preferred embodiments, the diffusional boundary or interface between components of the fluid streams in contact with the cell surface are minimized in cross-sectional dimension, so as to provide as sharp a transition as practical between the bulk properties of the components of the fluid stream in contact with the cell surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In particularly preferred embodiments, components of a flowing stream of fluid are arranged, relative to each other, via laminar flow convergence. Techniques for facilitating laminar flow are known. Some known techniques involve creating a side-by-side parallel, contacting multiple flowing streams/components of a flowing stream, that are free of turbulent mixing, but are eventually allowed to mix, at the interface between the components, by diffusion to allow analytical detection. Some preferred embodiments of the present invention utilize laminar flow to create multi-component fluid streams that flow over selected portions of a single cell&apos;s surface, and are free of turbulent mixing across such portions. In such laminar flow streams, mixing occurs only via diffusion at the interfaces of components of the fluid stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Techniques of the present invention can be carried out by flowing fluid streams within channels of a variety of shapes and dimensions, which are sized and configured to prevent turbulent mixing of the streams and maintain laminar flow therein. A wide variety of such techniques for creating laminar flow of fluid streams are known, including the use of microfluidic systems for creating multi-component laminar flow streams such as those useful in the context of the present invention. Accordingly, such systems will not be discussed exhaustively in detail herein. Such systems, and techniques for establishing and maintaining multi-laminar flow streams with such systems are described in detail, for example, in Kovacs, G. T. A., et al., 1998; Brody, J. P. et al., 1996; Vogel, S., 1994; and Weigl, B. H., et al. 1999 (each previously incorporated herein by reference), and Kamholz, A. E., Weigl, B. H., Finlayson, B. A., and Yager, P., &ldquo;Quantitative Analysis of Molecular Interaction in a Microfluidic Channel: The T-Sensor,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem. </italic></highlight>vol. 71 (1999); and Takayama, S., McDonald, J. C., Ostuni, E., Liang, M. N., Kenis, P. J. A., Ismagilov, R. F., and Whitesides, G., M., &ldquo;Patterning cells and their environments using multiple laminar fluid flows in capillary networks,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </italic></highlight>vol. 96 (1999), each incorporated herein by reference. Those of ordinary skill in the art, upon reading the reading the present disclosure, will be able to readily construct systems for providing multi-component laminar flow streams to carry out techniques of the present invention, without undo experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In certain preferred embodiments, the bulk property of the fluid stream components creating the potential for biophysical or biochemical interaction with a cell is a concentration of a substance within the fluid in contact with the surface or the cell, which substance is able to bring about a biophysical and/or biochemical interaction within the cell and/or upon the surface of the cell. For example, in one embodiment the substance binds to the surface of the cell. In such embodiments, the substance can be, for example, a ligand, hapten, protein, glycoprotein, lipoprotein, carbohydrate, etc., which is able to selectively bind to a particular cell surface receptor. Such substances, which can selectively bind to components of the surface of the cell can, in some embodiments, subsequently be endocytosed or otherwise transported into the interior of the cell, or can effect, in other embodiments, the physiology/function of the cell (e.g. establish an intracellular gradient of an active substance) via transmembrane signaling, receptor aggregation, or other known phenomena. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the substance is selected so that it is able to permeate across the cell plasma membrane into the interior of the cell, either by passive transport through the plasma membrane and/or active transport through the cell plasma membrane. As described above, substances which are able to permeate across the cell plasma membrane can be useful, within the context of an inventive method for creating long-term intracellular gradients of such substances within the interior of the cell. In yet other embodiments, the substance can be chosen to be able to degrade and/or depolymerize a portion of the cell surface and/or a protein or other molecule attached to the cell surface, for example a protein such as fibronectin, through a cell is attached to a substrate within the system. While particular exemplary applications of the use of the present inventive techniques for selectively contacting portions of a cell with components of a fluid stream are described in more detail below, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate, in view of the above discussion and subsequent disclosure, that the techniques provided according to the invention have an extremely wide applicability. for enabling the study, assay, detection, etc. of an extremely wide variety of cell parameters, functions, behavior, responses, etc. to an extremely wide variety of bulk properties and substances able to affect a biophysical and/or biochemical interaction with a cell. Each such application and use of the present invention is deemed to be within the scope of the present invention as described in the claims below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments of the techniques provided according to the invention, wherein multiple components of a flowing fluid stream differ from each other with respect to the concentration of a substance within at least one of the components, the concentration of the substance is essentially uniform in at least a portion of at least one of the components in contact with the cell, or preferably is essentially uniform in at least a portion of each of the components in contact with the cell, and most preferably is essentially uniform in essentially the entirety of each component in contact with portions of the cell. &ldquo;Essentially uniform&rdquo; as used herein in the context of the concentration of a substance in a component refers to the concentration of the substance at issue being essentially uniform across the cross-section of the component of the stream, which concentration differs from that of an adjacent component of the stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> For embodiments where a flowing stream of fluid has multiple flowing components characterized by laminar flow, which components are in contact with different portions of a single cell, because of the stability, lack of turbulent mixing, and ability to create a sharp interface between the components, as discussed in more detail below, the portions of the cell contacted by different components of the flowing stream can be portions of the main body portion of the cell. The &ldquo;main body portion of the cell&rdquo; as used herein refers to the region of the cell excluding small diameter protuberances, extensions, processes, etc. The main body portion of the cell, as used herein, has a minimum cross-sectional dimension, measured along at least one given direction, that is at least 10% of the maximum cross-sectional dimension of the cell, as measured along the same given direction. Thus, the techniques provided according to the invention can enable various portions of the main body portion of a cell to be partitioned and selectively contacted with various components of a flowing stream having a different potential for effecting a biophysical and/or biochemical interaction with the cell. Such subcellular resolution and control of the delivery of fluids to selected regions of cells is not typically available with prior art techniques for treating single cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the inventive techniques involves the ability to establish within a cell a gradient of an active substance. An &ldquo;active substance&rdquo; as used herein in the present context refers to a substance that is present within the interior of the cell and is able to effect a biophysical and/or biochemical change in the cell. Certain embodiments of the inventive techniques described herein are able to create long-term gradients of an active substance within the cell. A &ldquo;long-term gradient&rdquo; of an active substance within a cell as used herein refers to a gradient that is characterized by the existence of a first spatial region within the cell having a first concentration of the active substance and the existence of a second spatial region within the cell having a second concentration of the active substance, where the first concentration of the active substance differs from the second concentration of the active substance by at least about 5%, more preferably 10%, more preferably 20%, more preferably 30%, more preferably 40%, more preferably 50%, more preferably 60%, more preferably 70%, more preferably 80% more preferably 90%, most preferably 100%, at a time that exceeds about 5 minutes, more preferably about 10 minutes, more preferably about 20 minutes, most preferably about 30 minutes after the establishment of the gradient within the cell. In some especially preferred embodiments of the inventive technique, a gradient is established within the cell that is an essential steady state gradient, in other words where the above-mentioned differences in concentration between a first region of the interior of the cell and a second region of the interior of the cell are maintained indefinitely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As discussed in more detail below, certain embodiments of the inventive technique are able to establish such long-term or steady state gradients of an active substance within the cell even for active substances that are freely diffusable within the cell or for active substances where some of the molecules thereof are freely diffusable within the cell, while others are reversibly or irreversibly bound to immobile structures (within the time scale of the experiment) within the cell. An active substance that is &ldquo;freely diffusable&rdquo; or a &ldquo;freely diffusable&rdquo; portion of an active substance (i.e. the unbound molecules of an active substance having some molecules that become bound and others that remain unbound) within the cell as used herein refers to the molecules of such substance being not bound to, either reversibly or irreversibly, any internal components of the cell so that they become immobilized within the cell; in other words the molecules of such substance are free to diffuse throughout the cytoplasm of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The active substance forming the gradient within the cell can, in some embodiments, be a substance that is non-permeable with respect to the plasma membrane of the cell. In such embodiments, the gradient of the active substance can be established, for example, by exposure of a portion of the external surface of the plasma membrane of the cell to a substance or other condition which, through transmembrane signaling, or other mechanism, is able to establish the gradient of the intracellular active substance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In more typical embodiments, the active substance forming the gradient within the cell is a substance that is able to permeate across the cell&apos;s plasma membrane by either or both of passive diffusion and active transport. In preferred embodiments, the intracellular gradient of the active substance is established within the cell by selectively exposing a first portion of the exterior of the cell to a fluid, or component of a fluid stream, that contains a substance able to affect the concentration or distribution of the active substance within the interior of the cell and, simultaneously, exposing a second portion of the exterior of the cell to another fluid, or component of a fluid stream, for removing from the second portion of the exterior of the cell the substance able to affect the concentration or distribution of the active substance within the interior of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In certain preferred embodiments, the active substance forming a gradient within the cell is permeable through the plasma membrane of the cell and is selectively supplied to a first portion of the exterior surface of the plasma membrane of the cell while being simultaneously removed from a second portion of the exterior surface of the plasma membrane of the cell, thereby establishing the gradient of the active substance within the cell. In such embodiments, where, for example, the exterior of the cell is in contact with two components of a multi-component flowing stream, a first component of the fluid stream containing the substance and supplying it to the plasma membrane of the cell should contain the substance at a concentration that exceeds or is equal to the maximum concentration of the active substance within the cell, and a second component of the flowing stream removing the substance from the surface of the plasma membrane should contain the substance at a concentration that is less than or equal to the minimum concentration of the substance within the cell (e.g. be essentially free of the substance). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As is described in more detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for intracellular gradients that are established by substances that are supplied to the exterior of the cell membrane and permeate through the cell, thereby forming the intracellular gradient, long-term and steady state gradients are most effectively established when utilizing substances that are comprised of relatively small molecules (e.g., having molecular weights less than about 600) and which have relatively high ratio of their permeability constant through the plasma membrane to their diffusion constant in the cytoplasm of the cell (see for example <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A-C and associated discussion). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In general, when an intracellular gradient of an active substance is established within a cell by selectively exposing a first portion of the exterior of a cell to a first fluid or first component of a fluid stream supplying a substance to the first portion of the exterior of the cell and selectively exposing a second portion of the exterior cell to a second fluid or second component of a fluid stream removing the substance from the second portion of the exterior of the cell, the gradient of the active substance within the cell will be established such that there is a first region within the cell, proximate to at least a portion of the first portion of the exterior of the cell, which first region will have a first concentration of the active substance, and the existence of a second region within the cell proximate to at least a portion of the second portion of the exterior of the cell, which second region will have a second concentration of the active substance less than the first concentration. Also, in general, the greater the difference between the concentration of the substance in the first fluid or first fluid component supplying the substance of the cell surface and the concentration of the same substance in the second fluid or second fluid component removing the substance from the cell surface, the greater will be the differences in concentration within the cell of the active substance between the first region of the cell and the second region of the cell defining the intracellular gradient. In particularly preferred embodiments, the second fluid or second component of a fluid stream removing the substance from the surface of the cell is essentially free of the substance prior to contact with the external surface of the cell. By careful selection of operating parameters according to the teachings described herein, and routine experimentation, intracellular gradients of active substances can be established within cells such that certain, selected regions of the interior of the cell contain the active substance, while other regions of the interior of the cell are essentially free of the active substance, even for active substances that are freely diffusable within the cell and freely permeable across the plasma membrane of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As described in more detail below, the ability to establish long-term and steady state gradients of active substances within a cell, can enable a wide variety of tests, determinations and assays based on measurements or observations of a single cell that were previously unobtainable using typical prior art techniques and systems. For example, the ability to establish intracellular gradients by selectively supplying small, membrane-permeable molecules to selected portions of an exterior cell surface and removing the same from other portions of the same cell surface can enable a high degree of localization of such small molecules to subcellular microdomains within the cell, thus facilitating studies directed to determining the effect of such molecules on the subcellular microdomains, and/or to the spatial distribution and redistribution of subcellular microdomains with respect to various cell treatments. For example, as described in more detail below in the context of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and in the examples, the inventive techniques for establishing intracellular gradients can be utilized for detecting a parameter (e.g., fluorescence intensity) indicative of a spatial distribution of an active substance within the cell, a measure of the relative permeability of the plasma membrane of the cell to the active substance and/or a measure of the relative thickness of the cell (e.g., for a cell attached and spread to a substrate) at a selected location within the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-mentioned applications wherein the establishment of an intracellular gradient using the inventive techniques can be utilized for determining and/or studying physical properties of the cell such as thickness and membrane permeability, the ability to selectively deliver substances to portions of a cell while removing the substances from other portions of the cell, thereby establishing a long-term or steady state gradient of the active substance within the cell can enable assays which utilize a single cell as both a test and control. Such assays can be useful for studying intracellular trafficking and distribution of subcellular microdomains as well as to study biophysical or biochemical effects on a cell, or the efficacy of a treatment of a cell type with, various drugs, such as growth factors or cancer drugs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> For such applications, it is preferable to establish an intracellular gradient of the active substance characterized by the existence of one region of the interior of the cell containing the active substance and a second region of the interior of the cell essentially free of the active substance, preferably having a volume similar to, or a substantial fraction of, the region containing the active substance. In this way, the region of the interior of the cell containing the active substance acts as a &ldquo;test region&rdquo; and the region that is essentially free of the active substance acts as a built-in &ldquo;control region&rdquo; of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, the active substance is a drug or other substance able to disrupt or stabilize a cytoskeleton of the region of the interior of the cell containing the active substance. In some especially preferred embodiments, the cytoskeletal disrupting or stabilizing substance is an anti-cancer drug (e.g., Taxol). In another such embodiment, or as part of the above-mentioned embodiment involving cytoskeletal disrupting or stabilizing substances, a portion of the interior of the cell can be selectively treated with a substance able to localize within a subcellular organelle of the cell. For example, a substance can be chosen that is able to localize in a subcellular organelle of the cell which can be a fluorescent dye or label able to bind to the particular subcellular organelle and to enable the location and distribution of the organelles to be visually monitored or detected. A variety of such dyes and other substances able to localize in selected subcellular organelles are readily available and well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, a few of which are discussed below in the examples section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> By selectively treating one region of a cell with a membrane-permeable dye able to localize in a particular subcellular organelle, such as mitochondria or golgi, as described above, the trafficking and distribution of the labeled subcellular organelle, in response to a particular treatment or stimulus of the cell, can be monitored. In one embodiment the treatment or stimulus affecting the distribution or trafficking of the labeled subcellular organelles can be a selective stabilization or disassociation of the cytoskeleton in a particular region of the cell, as described above. Such a combined assay can potentially yield important information regarding the influence of the integrity of the cytoskeleton on the trafficking and intracellular motility of various subcellular organelles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-described applications of the inventive methods for creating an intracellular gradient, a wide variety of other determinations and assays based on selective treatment of a portion of single cell can be enabled by the inventive technique of contacting selected portions of the exterior of the cell with different fluids or components of a fluid stream. Such applications include, but are not limited to, for example, determining the effect on a single cell of the binding of a substance having affinity for a particular cell surface receptor to receptors on only a selected portion of the cell membrane; investigating the migration and destination of drugs or other substances which bind to cell surface receptors and are subsequently endocytosed into the cell (e.g. low density lipoprotein) by selectively supplying such substances to only a portion of the exterior surface of the cell; and studying the effect of selective treatment of a portion the exterior of the cell with substances, such as drugs, which are able to affect calcium influx/efflux through cellular ion channels and/or are able to create or affect the establishment of intracellular calcium ion gradients; etc. In general, the inventive techniques can enable a single cell to be utilized as both a test and control for determining the effect, efficacy, etc of a given treatment with a membrane-permeable active substance on a particular cell type by, for example, detecting for each of a first treated and second untreated regions of a single cell at least one parameter indicative of a response of the cell to the active substance determinative of the efficacy of the treatment with the active substance on the cell type. Alternatively, the inventive techniques can enable a single cell to be utilized as both a test and control for determining the effect, efficacy, etc of a given treatment with a substance that binds to the exterior of a particular cell type by, for example, detecting for each of a first, treated and second, untreated regions of a single cell at least one parameter indicative of a response of the cell to the bound substance determinative of the efficacy of the treatment with the substance on the cell type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The inventive techniques can enable various measurements and observations of cell behavior, such as the trafficking and transport of intracellular substances and subcellular organelles, not previously obtainable with typical prior art techniques. The inventive techniques can also enable various analytical tests and assays for evaluating treatment efficacy on cells of various substances, wherein by a single cell acting as both a test and a control, many statistical uncertainties inherent in studying the effects of such treatments on individual, whole cells within a population of a given cell type can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The inventive techniques and articles described herein are readily adaptable for use in automated systems for performing the above-described assays, tests, determinations, measurements, observations, etc. as well as many others, in an automated and fully controlled fashion. Described below, in the context of the figures and examples, is one specific embodiment of a microfluidic apparatus and system suitable for performing the inventive techniques described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a microchannel system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, constructed to enable a single cell to be contacted by more than one component of a flowing fluid stream, is illustrated schematically in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-C and FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-B. A &ldquo;microchannel system,&rdquo; or &ldquo;microchannel device,&rdquo; or &ldquo;microfluidic network,&rdquo; or &ldquo;microfluidic system,&rdquo; or &ldquo;microfluidic device&rdquo; as used herein refers to an article, device, or system including at least one conduit or capillary therein capable of containing a flowing fluid, where the conduit or capillary has a maximum cross-sectional dimension, in a direction perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow in the capillary or conduit, not exceeding about 1 millimeter. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that a wide variety of techniques, substrates, and materials can be used for fabricating microfluidic networks or flow devices useful for performing the techniques disclosed herein. Such devices can be constructed, for example, of micro-fine glass capillaries, micro-machined and/or photolithographically machined silicon or other substrates, or a variety of other known methods capable of forming conduits, capillaries, or channels within the above-mentioned size range. The use of each of such devices is deemed to be within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As previously discussed, preferred embodiments of microfluidic network system 300 are designed and constructed to enable the creation and maintenance of a laminarly flowing multi-component fluid stream in at least one channel of the network system. Laminar flow is characterized as flow for which the dimensionless Reynolds number, which is proportional to the density of the flowing fluid, the characteristic fluid speed, and the characteristic cross-sectional dimension of the channel in which the fluid flows and which is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the fluid, is less than about 2000. The equations and techniques for selecting parameters for fabricating microfluidic and other fluidic networks to enable such desired laminar flow are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are described, for example, in Brody, J. P., et al., 1996, and Kovacs, G. T. A., et al., 1998, both previously incorporated herein by reference; and in many standard fluid mechanics texts, for example, Bird R. B., Stewart W. E., and Lightfoot E. N., &ldquo;Transport Phenomena,&rdquo; John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1960) incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The microfluidic network system illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A-C and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-B comprises an elastomeric micromolded slab or membrane <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, in the illustrated embodiment, constructed of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), having a main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, in which the multi-component laminar flow stream is formed, and three inlet channels <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> feeding main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and converging at junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The channels are in the form of rectangular troths comprising negative relief features in bottom surface <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of slab <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. Inlet channels <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are in fluid communication with, and are fed by, inlet wells <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, respectively which wells traverse the thickness of slab <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and are open for filling at upper surface <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of PDMS slab <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The channels and wells are made fluid tight by contacting lower surface <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of slab <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> with a substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, such as a glass microscope slide, petri dish, cover glass, etc., thus forming a reversible, conformal seal. As a result, the substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> forms the bottom surface of each of the microfluidic channels of the network. In other embodiments, slab <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> may be irreversibly and permanently sealed to substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, if desired or the channels may be completely formed within the body of slab <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> such that conformal sealing to a substrate is not necessary to provide a completely enclosed flow channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Suitable micro replica-molding techniques for forming microfluidic network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are known in the prior art, and the reader is referred to Takayama, S., et al., 1999, previously incorporated herein by reference; and Duffy, D. C., McDonald, J. C., Schueller, J. A., and Whitesides, G. M., &ldquo;Rapid Prototyping of Microfluidic Systems in Poly(dimethylsiloxane),&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Anal. Chem., </italic></highlight>Vol. 70, 4974-4984 (1998); and International Publication No. WO 97/33737 (Kim., E., et al., 1997), both incorporated herein by reference, for details of the fabrication procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has a single main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, in which multi-component laminar flow is established, and three inlet channels <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> feeding the main flow channels and converging together at junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> in a fashion which forms a bisected &ldquo;Y&rdquo; shape. Each of the channels, in the illustrated embodiment, has a channel width, measured in a direction perpendicular to the fluid flow stream within the channel, of about 300 micrometers, and a channel depth of about 50 micrometers. Each of the inlet and outlet wells is sized to contain about 100 microliters of fluid and has a depth, providing a static pressure head for creating a driving force for fluid flow, equal to the thickness of slab <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, which, in the illustrated embodiment, is about 5 millimeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Microfluidic network system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has the capability of forming a fluid stream in main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> that includes anywhere from one to three distinct, parallel flowing components. For example, by supplying three fluids, differing from each other in at least one bulk property (or at least differing from each fluid in adjacent wells), one fluid to each of the inlet wells, a flow stream with three components <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, shown most clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</cross-reference>, can be established in channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</cross-reference> illustrates the results of creating such a three-component fluid stream in main channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Shown in the figure is a photograph of area <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> of the microfluidic network after the establishment of a three-component flow in main channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Component <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> comprises a fluid having therein a fluorescing substance as does component <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. Component <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, which forms the central component of the three component flow, comprises a fluid lacking the fluorescing substance of components <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, and thus appearing dark in the figure. It should be understood, that the illustrated embodiment having three inlet streams for forming a one- to three-component flow is merely exemplary and fewer or greater numbers of inlets may be configured to converge and feed a main channel to produce multi-component streams having anywhere from two components to a large number of components, for example, greater than ten components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To establish the multi-component fluid stream in microfluidic network system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, inlet wells <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> are initially filled, for example completely filled to top surface <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> of slab <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, while outlet well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is maintained free of fluid, for example, by aspiration, blotting, etc. For the system illustrated, with inlet wells, <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> completely filled with fluids having a similar density and viscosity and outlet well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> maintained essentially free of fluid, the driving force provided by the difference in fluid height within the inlet wells as compared to the outlet well is sufficient to create a maximum bulk fluid velocity in main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of about 0.6 cm/s. The Reynolds number at such flow rate, for aqueous fluids, is very small (less than one), and, therefore, fluid stream components <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> in main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, flow next to each other without mixing, other than by diffusion, and without turbulence. Also, since microfluidic network system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is configured such that the resistance to fluid flow in each of the inlet channels feeding main channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is about the same, the volumetric flow rate of each of components <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> will be similar and each of the components will have a similar cross-sectional dimension, as measured in the direction perpendicular to the flow stream in the main channel (e.g. see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C and 1D</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In general, the width of each component of the fluid stream in the main channel will be directly proportional to the volumetric flow rate of each of the component streams, which, in turn, is proportional to the relative driving forces and resistances to flow of each of the feed channels feeding the main fluid flow channel containing the multi-component flow stream. Accordingly, the relative widths of the components of the flow stream in the main channel and the particular positions of the interfaces separating the flow streams can be controlled and predicted by controlling the volumetric flow rate of the streams feeding the main channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The volumetric flow rates of the individual inlet streams can be readily controlled, in the illustrated embodiment, by changing the relative height of the liquid column contained in one or more inlet wells with respect to other inlet wells of the system. In other embodiments, the volumetric flow rates of the individual feed streams can be adjusted by changing the geometry or channel size of one or more of the inlet channels to create a greater or lesser resistance to flow as compared to that provided by other inlet streams (for example, see &ldquo;Pipe Friction Manual,&rdquo; 3rd. ed., Hydraulic Institute, New York (1961) and &ldquo;Fluid Mechanics for Engineering Technology,&rdquo; 3rd. ed., Prentice Hall, Englewood, N.J. (1989), both incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the volumetric flow rate of each of the inlet streams could be adjusted and controlled by feeding each of the inlet streams directly with a pump, for example a syringe or peristaltic pump capable of pumping fluids at variable, small, volumetric flow rates. In general, those of ordinary skill in the fluid mechanical arts will readily envision a variety of ways of adjusting and controlling the relative flow rates of streams feeding a main channel of a microfluidic network for performing the inventive techniques, such that the components of the fluid stream in the main flow channel have desired dimensions with interfaces therebetween positioned at desirable, and reproducibly obtainable, positions within the main flow channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The precise dimensions of the distinct components of a multi-component fluid stream and the position of the interfaces between the components can also be readily determined experimentally, while the device is in operation by, for example, including a material within the fluid streams, for example a dye, fluorescing substance, etc. which makes their size and position within the main flow channel readily detectable, for example, by microscopic observation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In general, for microfluidic networks designed and fabricated as discussed above, the thickness of individual components of a multi-component fluid stream in a main channel of the network and, accordingly, the separation between interfaces separating adjacent components can range anywhere from about 1 micrometer up to a distance approximating the width of the main flow channel. Accordingly, several such components and interfaces can be positioned such that they are in contact with the external surface of a single, typically sized cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>C, region <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> including the portions of the flow channels immediately upstream and downstream of junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is shown in magnified detail. A single cell <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is shown attached to substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and positioned in main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> such that its external surface is in contact with each of flow components <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> of the fluid stream, and such that both interfaces <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> are positioned in contact with the external surface of the cell. Such a configuration could be used, for example, to expose regions <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> of the cell to different biologically active substances contained within each of the components of the fluid flow, for example in order to localize such substances within the cell in regions proximate to each of the above-mentioned regions of the cell surface, and/or to study the effects of such substances on particular regions of the exterior and/or interior of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> After the inlet streams converge at junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> and come into contact with one another in main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (i.e., at interfaces <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>), diffusive mixing will tend to occur at the interfaces, between adjacent components of the stream which differ from each other with respect to the presence of, or bulk concentration of, one or more substances. Diffusive mixing will tend to occur at the interfaces between the flow components and the relative thickness of the diffusive region comprising the interface will have a tendency to grow with time of contact between the components as they flow along the length of main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, thus blurring the transition between the bulk properties of the individual components. Accordingly, in preferred embodiments, where it is desired to expose a single cell to two or more flow components with differing bulk properties in order to study differential effects of such bulk properties on the cell and/or utilize the differences in the bulk properties (e.g. a difference in bulk concentration of one or more substances) within the component for creating an intracellular gradient within the cell, it is desirable to maintain the thickness of the interface, and the extent of diffusional broadening at the interface, at value that is small with respect to the cell size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> For this reason, in preferred embodiment, the region of the microfluidic network selected for performing the observation, detection, and/or study of single cells positioned in the multi-component fluid stream is limited to a region less than about 500 micrometers downstream of junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> where the fluid streams converge. This distance is selected such that the square root of the average squared net distance traveled by diffusion of substance of interest at the interface (which is essentially equivalent to the effective thickness of the interface and the extent of diffusional broadening) is less than, and preferably substantially less than, the size of the cell under study. For example, for two adjacent aqueous fluids comprising two components of the fluid stream, the first component including a substance of interest having a diffusion coefficient of about 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 cm</superscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s, with the adjacent fluid component being essentially free of the substance, the diffusional broadening of the interface between the two components will increase by about 10 micrometers for every 0.1 seconds of contact. Thus, for an average bulk flow velocity in the main channel of the network system of about 0.5 cm/s over the time of treatment of the cell (a typical value for microfluidic network system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> having the configuration discussed above), a diffusional broadening of the interface between the flow components of about 10 micrometers will occur by the time the components have flowed to approximately 500 micrometers downstream of junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, for embodiments having cell sizes such that 10 micrometers will be a maximum tolerable extent of diffusional broadening of the interface (e.g., for embodiments involving spread cells having a diameters of 50 micrometers or greater), cells for study should be selected within region less than 500 micrometers downstream from the junction point. It should be apparent that for differentially sized cells, substances having different diffusion coefficients than illustrated, different flow rates, etc., the particular area over which diffusional broadening at the interface between components will comprise an acceptably small fraction of the cell size will vary. Estimation of the rate of diffusional broadening can be made by standard techniques well known in the arts of mass transport and fluid mechanics, and with reference to knowledge and information possessed by those of ordinary skill in such arts. Such calculations are described in more detail, for example, in Atkins, P. W. &ldquo;Physical Chemistry&rdquo; Freeman, N. Y. (1994), incorporated herein by reference; and Kamholz, A. E., et al., 1999, previously incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-B illustrate the use of microfluidic network system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for creating a two-component fluid stream in main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for selectively treating a left-hand portion of a cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> with a substance of interest. Initially, prior to establishment of the multi-component flow stream, microfluidic network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be treated to facilitate the attachment of cells to cover glass substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and filled with a suspension of cells to enable cell attachment/binding to the substrate, and spreading thereon. In some embodiments, the microfluidic network channels of microfluidic network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be filled with a desired cell suspension and the cells may be allowed to settle onto an untreated substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and attach and spread non-specifically. In other embodiments, substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, or the entire microfluidic network of system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be first exposed to or chemically-treated with one or more substances which facilitate non-specific or specific cell attachment spreading, for example, fibronectin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In addition, in some embodiments, portions of substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may be differentially treated, for example through utilization of a laminar flow patterning technique such as described in Takayama, S., et al., 1999, in order to form patterned regions of substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to differentially facilitate cell binding and/or to facilitate selective binding of particular types of cells in particular areas of the microfluidic channel. In this way, the present inventive technique of selectively treating parts of a single cell could be combined with the selective patterning techniques as disclosed in Takayama, S., et al., 1999 in order to facilitate the construction of sensors, assay systems, etc. able to both selectively position desired cells/cell types in particular positions within main channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of the microfluidic network and subsequently selectively position two or more components of a fluid treatment stream, and interfaces therebetween, to pass over and contact selected cells of the patterned arrangement of cells on the substrate, such that, for example, cells of different cell types may be simultaneously or sequentially studied utilizing the single-cell treatment techniques disclosed and provided by the present invention. The combination of selective patterning of cells within the main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the selective treatment of parts of cells so patterned and positioned within the main flow channel can substantially increase the flexibility and utility of the inventive system for performing single cell studies. Such combination can also enable further study of the presence and relative locations of different cell types with respect to each other, the effect of different substrate binding conditions on cellular behavior/interactions, etc., and a wide variety of other assays, tests, etc. wherein the interaction between different cell types and/or cell types and different substrate environments can be important, as would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-B, subsequent to preparation of the microfluidic network to facilitate cell binding, for example by immobilization of fibronectin thereto, and subsequent to filling the channels with a cell suspension and allowing cells (e.g., cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>) to attach and spread on substrate <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, a two-component fluid stream is created by filling inlet well <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> with a fluid containing a green-fluorescing active substance and filling wells <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> with a similar fluid, except not including the active substance. Outlet well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is maintained free of fluid, as shown, to facilitate flow within the microfluidic system established and maintained by a driving force created by the difference in height of the fluids in the inlet wells and the outlet wells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, an appropriate cell for study is chosen, and the effect of the treatment with the active substance contained in component <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> of the fluid flow stream in main channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is detected by observing region <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> immediately downstream of junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> (e.g., within about 50 to about 500 micrometers downstream of junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>) utilizing microscope objective <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and a fluorescent optical filter able to visualize the green fluorescence of the fluid comprising fluid component <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. A cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is then selected for observation and study which is positioned such that interface <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> between component <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> containing the active substance and component <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> of the flow lacking the active substance passes over of a main body portion of the cell. As discussed previously, preferably, cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is selected such that the interface <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>, at the position where the cell is located, is sharp and has a minimal amount of diffusional broadening (i.e., cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is positioned in close proximity to junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>). As discussed in more detail immediately below in the context of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, such a cell can be continuously observed via objective <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of a microscopic optical detection system during a selected treatment time to determine the effect of the active substance in flow component <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> on the cell. In some embodiments, as described below in the context of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the substance supplied to the cell in component <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is a substance that permeates through the plasma membrane of cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> becoming localized within the intracellular space of cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> in a region proximate to at least a portion of the portion of the exterior of cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> in contact with flow component <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, such that an intracellular gradient of the active substance is established within cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> It should be understood, that in other embodiments the active substance need not be a fluorescing or visually detectable substance. For embodiments where the optical properties of the different components of the fluid stream contacting a single cell are essentially the same, as described previously, an inert dye, compatible with the active substance and non-interfering with the test to be performed, can be added to one or more of the inlet streams in order to create a visual contrast between the different flow components established within the main channel such that an appropriate cell can be selected for study, as described above. In addition, other detection means than the optical microscope illustrated may be utilized, in appropriate situations, to detect active substances and/or changes/responses of the cell to a selected treatment. A wide variety of such detection systems and methods, for example, radioactivity detectors, magnetic resonance detectors, conductivity detectors, etc., are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be utilized within the context and scope of the present invention, as would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A-C illustrate one embodiment for creating an intracellular gradient of an active substance within cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> utilizing microfluidic network <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, as configured and operated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-B. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-C, left-most flow component <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> contains a green-fluorescing, cell membrane-permeable small molecule active substance (e.g., a membrane permeable fluorescent dye). The green-fluorescing small molecule active substance included in flow component <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, in the illustrated embodiment, can be a substance that remains freely diffusable within the cell, or that is able to reversibly bind to nucleic acids, or other immobile components, within the cell, such that upon permeating into the cell, a portion of the substance will be freely diffusable within the cell and another portion will be reversibly bound to nucleic acids/immobile structures within the cell (e.g., within the nucleus of the cell). As illustrated, inlet wells <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) are filled with a similar buffer/medium, except not including the green-fluorescing active substance, such that a second component <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> of the fluid stream is positioned over cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, which component is essentially free of the active substance. Cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, as illustrated, has been selected such that interface <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> appears to be very sharp with a minimal amount of diffusional broadening at the interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Active substances able to permeate across the cell plasma membrane that are small molecules with a typical diffusion coefficient on the order of about 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s or more will tend to diffuse within the cell over a length several times the maximum size dimension of a typical cell in a short period of time (e.g., under 1 minute). It is for this reason that typical prior art methods for localizing active substances within cells are unable to create and maintain long-term intracellular gradients. As previously discussed, such prior art techniques for localizing substances within a cell typically result in a redistribution of the material with in the cell such that the substance reaches approximately 95% of its final equilibrium distribution within the cell within a couple of minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> By utilizing the techniques provided according to the present invention, for example as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-C, significant intracellular concentration differences between distinct regions of the cell (e.g., concentration differences of greater than 5%) can be maintained for long periods of time, as discussed above, even for substances that are freely diffusable within the cell. The establishment and maintenance of the intracellular concentration gradient in the illustrated embodiment is enabled by providing an influx of the substance to the interior of the cell by supplying the substance to portion <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> of the exterior surface of the cell via contact with flow component <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> top) and removing the substance from exterior surface portion <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> of cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> by contacting the portion with flow component <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> during treatment. Such treatment can establish an intracellular gradient characterized by a region <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> within the cell which there is a relatively high concentration in the active substance and a region <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> within the cell where the concentration is lower, and in some instances can be essentially free of the active substance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The extent, character, and distribution of the active substance within the cell as a function of the physical/biophysical/chemical/biochemical properties of the cell and the properties of the active substance and the design/operating parameters of the microfluidic network performing the single-cell treatment can be estimated, modeled, or predicted using well-known principles of mass transport, or straightforward adaptations thereof, to predict the spatial distribution of active substance within the cell (such well known principles of mass transport are discussed, for example, in Bird, R. B., Stewart, W. E., and Lightfoot, E. N., 1960; Atkins, P. W., et al., 1994; Kamholz, A.

The intracellular concentration gradient of the active substance within cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> for such conditions can be approximated by Equation 1 below:

<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Using this equation, the time required for the concentration gradient to reach more than 90% of its steady-state value was calculated to be less than about 10 seconds for D&equals;5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 cm</superscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s at P/h values ranging between about 0.2-200 s<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> illustrates calculated results using the above equations for steady-state intracellular concentration gradients of a typical rapidly diffusing small molecule active substance (D&equals;5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 cm</superscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>/s) for model cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> for several values of P/h. These calculated results illustrate the general applicability of the inventive techniques for establishing steady-state intracellular gradients and subcellular localization of small molecule active substances having a wide range of permeabilities (P) in surface attached cells, such as model cell <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, although with different degrees of spatial resolution and degrees of difference in concentration between regions of maximum and minimum concentration within the cell depending on the permeability of the active substance (i.e., the higher the permeability (P) the greater the difference). For example, in an exemplary embodiment involving a spread cell with a height of about 5 &mgr;m (many types of attached and spread mammalian cells have a maximum cell height of 5 &mgr;m) the above calculated results illustrate the applicability of the inventive techniques for establishing steady-state intracellular gradients and subcellular localization of small molecule active substances having permeabilities ranging at least within the range of about 1 to about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>cm/s. As the as the height of the cell is decreased (e.g. below 5 &mgr;m), the permeability of the active substance required to successfully form the above-described long-term or steady state intracellular gradients will also be decreased over the above-mentioned range (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>), and, for some such thin spread cells, the inventive techniques for a establishing steady-state intracellular gradients and subcellular localization of small molecule active substances could be successfully employed for forming such gradients of active substances having permeabilities ranging down, from the above-mentioned range, to about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;8 </superscript></highlight>cm/s or less. In general, areas of high concentrations of small molecule active substances can be spatially confined in the cell with greater resolution with increasing permeability, decreasing thickness of the cell, and decreasing diffusion coefficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Equation 2 above can be used together with an observation or detection of the concentration distribution of the active substance in the x direction within the cell to determine a measurement related to the relative height of the cell at the selected position and to determine a measurement related to the permeability of the active substance through the cell plasma membrane. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, such measurement can be made by determining, quantitatively, the fluorescence intensity within the cell as a function of distance x. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> A negative relief of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) was formed by curing a prepolymer (Sylgard 184, Dow-Corning) on a silanized silicon (Si) master having a positive relief of the capillary channels formed in photoresist (SU-8-50, MicroChem) on its surface by a replica molding method as described in Duffy, D. C., et al., 1998, and Takayama, S., et al., 1999, both previously incorporated herein by reference. The PDMS membrane <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> thus formed, with a negative relief microchannel system, was placed on a microscope cover glass <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> resulting in the formation of capillary channels able to act as flow channels for fluid. The PDMS membrane sealed against the glass microscope cover glass by conformal contact, without the need to make the PDMS hydrophilic by plasma oxidation or other methods before use. The resulting microchannel system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) had a main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in fluid communication with an outlet well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and three feed channels <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, fed by inlet wells <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, respectively. The feed channels converged into main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> at junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>.

In brief, cells were cultured under 10% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>on Petri dishes (Falcon) coated with gelatin in DMEM (GIBCO) containing 10% calf serum (CS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 &mgr;g/ml streptomycin, 100 &mgr;g/ml penicillin, and 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Inlet well <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> was then filled with a solution of a membrane permeable fluorescent nucleic acid binding dye-Syto 9 (60 &mgr;M in DMEM/10% CS, Molecular Probes). Inlet wells <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> were filled with a similar solution, but without the Syto 9. Fluid in outlet well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> was aspirated at regular intervals to maintain a difference in hydraulic head driving the flow in the channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The flowing streams and attached BCEs were visualized utilizing a fluorescence inverted microscope, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. A cell was chosen for observation which was positioned such that the interface separating the first component of the flow in the main channel, which included the Syto <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and appeared fluorescent green under the microscope, and the second, clear, Syto 9-free component was sharp and positioned over the main body portion of the cell (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, where the interface position corresponds approximately to dashed white line). The cell was selected so that it was positioned less than about 500 &mgr;m from junction <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, in order to minimize the thickness of the region of interface between the two stream components where a diffusion-induced gradient of Syto 9 exists external of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Flow was maintained until intracellular diffusion reached approximately its steady state value (about 10 minutes). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> (bottom) shows a fluorescence photomicrograph illustrating the appearance of the observed BCE cell at steady state. The schematic cross-sectional view of the cell directly above the photomicrograph (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> (top)) illustrates the relative thickness of the cell in the different regions of flow as well as the direction of net migration of Syto 9 within the cell and between the cell and the external media (arrows). As expected from the above-described theoretical analysis (i.e. the relationship x &prop;{square root}{square root over (h)} developed above in Eq. 7) the distance from the laminar flow boundary of Syto 9-containing media (dotted line) to the intracellular migration front (right-most extent of the fluorescent green are within the cell) is greater in the thicker parts of the cell <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> compared to the thinner parts <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Device fabrication and cell culture and attachment of BCE cells was performed as described above in Example 1. Creation and maintenance of flow in the channels and selection and observation of a BCE cell positioned straddling the interface of two components of the flow stream established in the main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) was performed in a similar fashion as described previously in Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> At the outset of the experiment, right-most inlet wells <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of the channel system (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) was filled with a solution of a membrane-permeable, green-fluorescent mitochondria-specific dye (Mitotracker Green&trade; FM, Molecular Probes, 3 &mgr;M in DMEM/10% CS), which was allowed to flow over the right portion of the observed BCE cell, while a similar media, except excluding the Mitotracker Green&trade; FM dye, was added to inlet wells <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and allowed to flow over the left portion of the observed BCE cell for 5 min. The channels were then briefly washed with dye-free media and a photomicrograph (with 488 nm excitation, FITC filter) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) was taken of the BCE cell. The white dotted line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> indicates the position of the interface between the component of the flow essentially free of the fluorescent dye (left) and the component of the flow containing the Mitotracker Green&trade; FM dye (right). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, a solution of membrane-permeable Mitotracker Red&trade; CM-H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>XRos (Molecular Probes, 3 &mgr;M in DMEM/10% CS) was allowed to flow over the left portion of the cell and dye-free media (DMEM/10% CS) was allowed to flow over the right portion of the cell for 1 min. by performing essentially the same flow procedure as described directly above, except adding the Mitotracker Red&trade; solution to inlet well <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and dye-free media to inlet wells <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The channels were then briefly washed with dye-free media, as described above, and a fluorescence photomicrograph (with 560 nm excitation, TRITC filter) was taken of the cell (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>). Again, the white dotted line in the figure indicates the position of the interface between the dye-containing and dye-free components of the flow stream over the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The entire cell was then subsequently washed with media containing a membrane-permeable fluorescent blue nucleus-staining dye (Hoechst 33342, Molecular Probes, 10 &mgr;g/ml in DMEM/10% CS). The cell was then briefly washed with dye-free media, as described above, and observed with the fluorescence microscope. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> is a photomicrograph showing an overlay of the BCE cell as observed with the 488 nm excitation, FITC filter (green), the 560 nm excitation, TRITC filter (red), and an optical filter for visualizing the Hoechst 33342 dye (blue), together with a phase contrast image of the cell. Notice that the red stained mitochondria are preferentially segregated in the left-hand portion of the cell and the green stained mitochondria are segregated in the right-hand portion of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</cross-reference> is a photomicrograph illustrating an overlay of the above-described fluorescence and phase contrast images except taken 2.5 hrs. after the selective treatment of parts of the cell with the fluorescent mitochondrial stains, as described above. The image shows that the mitochondria have redistributed significantly towards the right-hand side of the cell, in the direction of migration of the cell on the substrate (as evidenced by the pseudopodia visible at the far right extremity of the cell). The image shows that the left-hand region of the cell after 2.5 hrs. of incubation was still occupied primarily by red-labeled mitochondria, while the right-hand region of the cell contained both red- and green-labeled mitochondria. This observation indicates that the mitochondria have redistributed towards the right, towards the pseudopodia. Because mitochondria in distinct regions of the cell were labeled with different fluorescent labels by the above-described process, the observation of the overall dynamics of mitochondria movement was substantially improved over typical prior art techniques of observing mitochondria with homogenous labeling. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Device fabrication and cell culture and attachment of BCE cells was performed as described above in Example 1. Creation and maintenance of flow in the channels and selection and observation of a BCE cell positioned straddling the interface of two components of the flow stream established in the main flow channel was performed in a similar fashion as described previously in Example 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In the present example, prior to selective treatment of a portion of a single BCE cell with a membrane-permeable actin disrupting drug, the BCE cells attached to the microfluidic network were uniformly exposed to media containing Mitotracker Green&trade; FM mitochondrial stain, as described in Example 2, in order to uniformly stain the mitochondria of each of the BCE cells in the microfluidic channels. Subsequent to mitochondrial staining, partial cell treatment with the actin disrupting drug was accomplished by filling right-most well <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) of the microfluidic channel network with media containing latrunculin A (1 &mgr;M in DMEM/10% CS). Similar media, except not including the latrunculin A, was added to inlet wells <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and flow was maintained during the experiment as described previously in Example 1. Because the latrunculin A-containing media is non-fluorescent and visually transparent, in order to determine the position of the interface between the latrunculin A-containing component and latrunculin A-free component of the fluid flow in main flow channel <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a small amount of Dextran 70,000-Cascade Blue (0.5 mg/ml, Molecular Probes) was added to the latrunculin A-containing media so that the media would appear blue when viewed with bright field and phase contrast microscopy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is a phase-contrast photomicrograph of three BCE cells selected for observation at the beginning of the latrunculin A treatment. The blue region (right) represents the flow of media containing latrunculin A and Dextran 70,000-Cascade Blue. As can be seen from the figure, the interface between the latrunculin A-containing component of the flow stream and the latrunculin A-free component of the flow stream was positioned over the center cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> is an overlay of fluorescence and phase-contrast images of the center cell in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. The image shows an enlarged view of the center cell in phase contrast, overlaid with a fluorescence photomicrograph showing its green-stained mitochondria. The position of the interface between the above-mentioned two components of the flow stream is shown by the dotted white line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> shows the same cells as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, except after exposure to the two-component flow stream for a period of about 10 min. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of the center cell of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> in phase contrast, overlaid with a fluorescence photomicrograph of its mitochondria (stained green). Comparison of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D and 5B</cross-reference> indicates that the positions of the mitochondria, after exposure of the right-hand part of the cell to latrunculin A-containing media for 10 min., have shifted towards the left-hand (untreated) part of the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</cross-reference> is a fluorescence photomicrograph of the same three cells as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, after the above-described treatment with latrunculin A, and subsequent to fixation and staining of the actin cytoskeleton (with phalloidin Alexa 594, Molecular probes&mdash;Cells fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min., followed by permeabilization of the membrane with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 minutes, followed by incubation with the stain and washing with PBS). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</cross-reference> shows that the actin cytoskeleton is largely intact in the left cell, which was not exposed to the latrunculin A. In contrast, a substantial portion of the actin cytoskeleton appears, in the rightmost cell, to be depolymerized. The center cell (shown most clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</cross-reference>), which was partially exposed to the latrunculin A-containing media, as described above, has the greatest degree of actin disruption evident in its treated, right side portion, which portion also corresponds to the region showing the largest displacement of mitochondria (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference> above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present example demonstrates the ability of the inventive method to selectively disrupt actin filaments in only part of a cell. Cytoskeletal architecture is important for mechanotransduction within cells. Previously, studies of the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton of cells have typically used methods that either stress the cell mechanically and locally, or that disrupt the cytoskeleton indiscriminately throughout the entire cell. Unlike the present invention, as exemplified in this example, typical prior art methods are not able to disrupt the cytoskeleton in only a portion of a single cell via use of cytoskeletal-disrupting chemicals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D, disruption of the actin filaments in the right-hand region of the center cell by selectively supplying latrunculin A-containing media to the right-hand portion of the cell caused the mitochondria and nucleus to shift towards the left, even though the overall peripheral shape of the cell remained relatively unchanged. This observation is in accord with suggestions in the prior art that the cytoskeleton of a cell comprises a tensegrity structure in which actin filaments are the tensile elements and microtubules act as struts. The observed displacement of the mitochondria, which are mainly associated with microtubules, by local disruption of actin within a portion of the cell is consistent with, and demonstrative of, this suggested mechanism. </paragraph>

(flow stream shown by the fluorescence photomicrograph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> (left)); and in the second step, media containing WGA labeled with Alexa 488 (Alexa 488-WGA, Molecular Probes, 0.5 mg/ml in DMEM/1% BSA) was allowed to flow over the right-hand region of the same BCE cell for 5 min (flow stream shown by the fluorescence photomicrograph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> (right) position of BCE cell shown by phase contrast image <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B(left)).

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Few chemical reactions have reached the prominence of aldol-type reactions in the synthesis of complex molecules (Mukaiyama, 1982; Kim et al., 1991; Heathcock, 1984). The classical aldol reaction is highly atom economic (Trost, 1995) but suffers from poor chemo- and regioselectivity. In current practice, aldol reactions typically employ a preformed enolate, enol, or equivalent; an example is the Muikaiyama reaction, which employs an enol silyl ether. These reactions generally provide greater selectivity, but require stoichiometric amounts of base and/or adjunct reagents (e.g. silylating agents), thus decreasing the atom efficiency of the process. Most asymmetric versions of the aldol reaction reported to date rely upon the use of chiral auxiliaries (Seyden-Penne, 1995). Mukaiyama-type processes using asymmetric catalysts have also been reported (Johnson et al., 2000; Carreira, 1998; Mahrwald, 1999; Groger et al., 1998; Nelson, 1998; Bach, 1994); as noted above, these require prior stoichiometric formation of the nucleophile. Methods for direct catalytic asymmetric aldol addition, without prior stoichiometric formation of the nucleophile, are thus being sought. Processes employing both biological-type (e.g. catalytic antibodies) (Machajewski et al., 2000; Takayama et al., 1997; Hoffinann et al., 1998) and non-biological-type (Yoshikawa et al., 1999; Shibasaki et al., 1999; List et al., 2000; Notz et al., 2000; Agami et al., 1987; Nakayawa et al., 1985) catalysis have been reported. In all of these cases, however, significant excesses of the donor and/or large amounts of catalyst must be employed, and unbranched aldehyde substrates remain problematic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The Henry (nitro-aldol) reaction (see e.g. Luzzio et al.) is also a fundamental C&mdash;C bond forming reaction which generates stereogenic centers. There are very few examples to date of catalytic asymmetric nitroaldol reactions. Shibasaki et al. have carried out such reactions using chiral heterobimetallic (rare earth-alkali metal) catalysts, and Jorgensen et al. have reported the catalytic asymmetric aza-Henry reaction of silyl nitronates with imines. However, the use of silyl nitronates as nucleophiles undermines the atom economy of the reaction. </paragraph>

Examples of alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, n-heptyl, and isopropyl. &ldquo;Cycloalkyl&rdquo; refers to a fully Hi saturated cyclic monovalent radical containing carbon and hydrogen, which may be further substituted with alkyl. Examples of cycloalkyl groups are cyclopropyl, methyl cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, ethylcyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Alkenyl&rdquo; refers to an acyclic monovalent radical containing carbon and hydrogen, which may be branched or a straight chain, and which contains at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The alkenyl group may be monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. Similarly, &ldquo;alkynyl&rdquo; refers to such a radical having at least one carbon-carbon triple bond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Lower&rdquo; alkyl (alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, etc.) refers to a group having 1 to 6 carbons, preferably 1 to 4 carbons. </paragraph>

Groups having a single ring (monocyclic) or two condensed rings (bicyclic) are generally preferred, with monocyclic groups being particularly preferred. The term includes heteroaryl groups, which are aromatic ring groups having one or more nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms in the ring, such as furyl, pyrrole, pyridyl, and indole. Carbocyclic aryl groups are preferred for the chiral ligands of the invention. By &ldquo;substituted&rdquo; is meant that one or more ring hydrogens in the aryl group is replaced, independently, with halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, cyano, amide, tertiary amino, alkyl- or aryl sulfonyl, sulfonamide, hydroxy, or halo(lower alkyl). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The Group 2A or Group 2B metal is preferably selected from the group consisting of Zn, Cd, Mg, Ca, and Ba, is more preferably Zn or Mg, and is most preferably Zn. In a series of aldol reactions conducted as described herein, employing magnesium and zinc complexes, zinc complexes generally gave the higher enantioselectivities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> For ease of synthesis, the ligand preferably has C2 symmetry; however, this is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In formula I, R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>-R<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>are aryl groups, which may be the same or different. Each of these groups is optionally substituted with one or more substituents X, where each X is independently selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, aralkynyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, amide, sulfonamide, alkyl- or arylsulfonyl, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, and halogen. In addition, any two adjacent groups (i.e. R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, R<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>, or both combinations) may be linked via an &agr;-carbon of each the group (i.e. a ring carbon adjacent the carbon atom linked to the carbinol carbon) to form a tricyclic or larger ring system; e.g., a fluorene, xanthene, or dihydroanthracene ring system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In groups R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>to R<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>, the substituents defined as group X are preferably selected from alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, ester, amide, sulfonamide, alkyl- or arylsulfonyl, nitro, and halogen; more preferably selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, nitro, and halogen; and most preferably selected from lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, and halogen. In one embodiment, each of groups R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>-R<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>is phenyl, unsubstituted or substituted with a group selected from lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, and halogen. In specific embodiments, R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>-R<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>are identical and each is unsubstituted phenyl, (&agr;- or &bgr;-naphthyl, o-tolyl, biphenyl, or &bgr;-methoxyphenyl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The value of m is from 0 to 3, inclusive; m is preferably 1 or 3, and is most preferably 1. R<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>represent one or more substituents on the respective N-heterocycles, independently selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, and aryl. To avoid the presence of additional chiral centers on the nitrogen heterocycles, each group R<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>is preferably hydrogen. However, the nitrogen heterocycles could be substituted such that chiral centers are not formed; i.e. by having two identical substituents at a given position, as in a gem-dimethyl group. Although not depicted in formula I, the nitrogen heterocycle may contain a further heteroatom, as in a morpholino ring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In selected embodiments, each of R<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>is selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxy, and halogen. Preferably, R<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>are both hydrogen or both represent a gem-dimethyl group; most preferably, R<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>are both hydrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>represents one or more groups on the phenyl ring independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, X as defined above, and a further fused ring, e.g. to form a naphthyl group.

Multiple groups R<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>can be present and can be the same or different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Representative ligands include compounds 1a-1n, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The stoichiometry of metal to ligand in the catalytic complex was examined via the evolution of ethane gas upon reaction of ligand 1a with Et2Zn. Addition of two equivalents of Et<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Zn per ligand 1 liberated three equivalents of ethane. Addition of water to this complex liberated the fourth equivalent of ethane. This observation supports a 2:1 stoichiometry of metal ion to ligand in the complex. In addition, exposure of the complex to acetic acid in the inlet of an electrospray mass spectrometer produced a series of peaks consistent with the formula C<highlight><subscript>45</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>47</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>Zn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, i.e. a bimetallic zinc complex of 1a having bound acetate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> B. Preparation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> B1. Ligand Synthesis </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The availability of a variety of enantiomerically pure ax-amino acids provides a convenient route to the chiral &agr;-amino alcohol moiety of the ligands. For example, an ester of L-proline (natural S configuration) or D-proline (R configuration) was used to prepare ligands 1a-1n, as described in Examples 1-13 below. The R- and S-isomers of other 2-carboxyl N-heterocycles, such as 2-azetidine carboxylic acid, 2-piperidine carboxylic acid, and 1H-hexahydroazepine-2-carboxylic acid, are commercially available, and syntheses permitting preparation of substituted derivatives have been reported (e.g. Seebach et al., 1989; Yazawa et al., 1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A convenient synthesis of ligands of formula I starts with 2,6-hydroxymethylation of a phenol, as described, for example, in Van der Boom et al., 1998 and Arnaud et al., 1997 (reaction of &bgr;-cresol). Reaction of other para-substituted phenols is described in Examples 10 and 11, below. Para-substituted phenols are preferred for this reaction (addition of formaldehyde) to preclude reaction at the para-position. Differently substituted 2,6-hydroxymethylated phenols can be prepared by methods known in the art. As shown in Examples 12A-B, for example, 3,5-dimethyl-2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)phenol (for ligand lm) was prepared via the reaction of dimethyl acetonedicarboxylate with 2,4-pentanedione. Crisp et al., 2000, describes the preparation of 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)phenol in high yield by LiAlH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>reduction of dimethyl (2-hydroxy isophthalate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The primary hydroxyl groups of the 2,6-bis(hydroxymethyl)phenol compound are converted to efficient leaving groups, e.g. bromide or tosylate. The resulting compound is then reacted with two equivalents of a chiral 2-carboxy N-heterocycle. Addition of an aryl carbon nucleophile, such as an aryl Grignard reagent, is then employed to convert each carboxyl group (preferably in ester form) to the tertiary alcohols bearing groups R<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>to R<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>. This general route was used to prepare ligands 1a-1c, 1g-h, and 1k, as described in Examples 1,3-4, 8-9 and 11, below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, N-Boc protected R- or S-proline, or another of the 2-carboxyl N-heterocycles noted above, is first reacted with an aryl carbon nucleophile, such as an aryl Grignard. The tertiary alcohol product is deprotected and reacted with a 2,6-bis(bromomethyl)phenol compound. Examples of this route, used to prepare ligands 1a, 1d-f, 1j, and 1n, are described in Examples 2, 5-7, 10 and 13. The intermediate diphenylprolinol is commercially available. The route described in Examples 5-7 may be used to prepare other diarylprolinols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> During synthesis of variously substituted ligands, protecting groups, as known in the art, may be used as necessary for any reactive substituents that may be present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The following table gives the structures of ligands 1a-1n, where, in structure I, m is 1 and R<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>and R<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>are hydrogen.

Such compounds include dialkyl metals R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>M, alkyl (or alkenyl) metal halides RMX, metal alkoxides M(OR)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, alkyl (dialkylamino)metal compounds RMNR<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and alkyl (diarylamino) metals (where the groups R may vary and are preferably lower alkyl or lower alkenyl). As noted above, preferred metals include Zn, Cd, Mg, Ca, and Ba. In one embodiment, the compound is diethyl zinc; diphenylamino ethyl zinc (Ph<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NZnEt) was also effective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The ratio of metal compound to ligand used for formation of the catalyst is in the range of 1:1 (Tables 2-5 below) to 2:1 (Tables 1 and 6 below). When ratios less than 2:1 are used, it is likely that excess ligand is present in the catalyst solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The catalyst is preferably formed in an aprotic and non-complexing solvent, such as, for example, THF, ether, acetone, toluene, other hydrocarbon solvents, chlorinated solvents, or a mixture thereof. Such solvents are generally suitable for carrying out the aldol reaction as well; therefore, a catalyst solution can be prepared and used directly, as described in the Examples below. For nitroaldol reactions, ether-based solvents such as THF, dioxane, DME and diethyl ether are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Typically, the catalyst is formed by combining a 1:1 to 2:1 ratio of metal compound and ligand in solution. (See e.g. Examples 14A, 15, 17-18 and 20A.) A portion of the resulting solution is combined with the remaining reaction components, as described in the Examples below. Assuming a ratio of two metal atoms per ligand in the complex, the molar quantity of catalytic complex present in the reaction mixture would be one half the number of moles of metal compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> III. Stereoselective Aldol Reactions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As demonstrated below, use of the catalytic complexes and methods of the invention give aldol reaction products with high enantioselectivity starting from a variety of aldehyde substrates, including substrates with no branching and/or with unsaturation at the &agr;-carbon, which have historically given poor enantioselectivity in asymmetric addition reactions. In general, the aldehyde is of the formula RCHO, where R is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, and aralkynyl. R is optionally substituted, where preferred substituents are selected from alkoxy, aryloxy, hydroxy, alkyl- or arylsulfonyl, sulfonamide, ester, amide, cyano, nitro, and halogen. While &agr;-branched aldehydes typically give greater selectivity, the reaction is also successful with unbranched aldehydes, as shown below. A further advantage of the present invention is that the donor compound (nitroalkyl or ketone) need not be provided in preactivated form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> A. Reactions with Ketone Donors </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> A large range of ketone donors may be used, as long as an &agr;-hydrogen is present. The ketone is preferably of the formula R<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>(C&boxH;O)CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Y, where Y is selected from hydrogen, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, amide, ester, alkyl- or arylsulfonyl, sulfonamide, halogen, aryl, and alkyl, and R&prime; is selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, aralkenyl, and aralkynyl. R&prime; is optionally substituted, with preferred substituents selected from alkoxy, aryloxy, hydroxy, amide, alkyl- or arylsulfonyl, sulfonamide, ester, cyano, nitro, and halogen. In selected embodiments, Y is selected from hydrogen and hydroxyl, and R&prime; is selected from aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkenyl, and aralkynyl. Examples include aryl methyl ketones and aryl (hydroxymethyl) ketones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The reactions can be performed over a wide temperature range; in general, lower temperatures are expected to provide greater selectivity but require longer reaction times. Temperatures of &minus;35&deg; C. to room temperature were found to be generally suitable, though temperatures outside this range can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> A variety of solvents were found satisfactory, including those useful for forming the catalyst, as noted above (e.g. THF, ether, acetone, toluene, other hydrocarbon solvents, and chlorinated solvents) as well as DMSO, DMF, and the protic solvent IPA (isopropanol). Addition of small amounts of IPA to reactions carried out in THF was found to increase rate and yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> It was found that turnover frequency was generally improved by the addition of a small quantity of molecular sieves; e.g. about 50-500 mg, preferably about 100-200 mg, per mmol of aldehyde. Pore size of the molecular sieves can vary, e.g. from about 3 to 6 Angstroms, as long as the sieves are effective to trap water without trapping any significant amount of larger reaction components. In certain cases, the addition of about 5 to 15 mole % of a weak coordinating agent for zinc, such as a trialkyl phosphate, triarylphosphine oxide or triarylphosphine sulfide, was shown to improve both turnover and e.e. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Table 1 shows the results of a series of reactions employing a variety of aldehydes and ketones, and using the following reaction conditions (see general procedure in Example 14): ca. 5 mol % ligand 1a, ca. 10 mol % ZnEt<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 15 mol % triphenylphosphine sulfide (Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>P&equals;S), and 4A molecular sieves (200 mg/mmol aldehyde) in THF. Reaction time was 2 days, with the exception of entry 7 (4 days). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Absolute configurations were assigned by comparison to the literature (see characterization data in Examples below)or by analogy. Enantiomeric excess was determined using chiral HPLC (Chiracel&trade; OD column).

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Lower ketone/aldehyde ratios generally gave good selectivity but lower yields. A 96% recovery of excess acetophenone was demonstrated for entry 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Improved e.e.&apos;s were obtained on aldehydes without branch points at the &agr;-carbon by reducing the temperature of the reaction. In the remaining reactions, as can be seen, very high e.e.&apos;s were routinely obtained. Using a chiral but racemic aldehyde, 2-phenylpropenal (entry 6), a 2:1 diastereomeric mixture of adducts, both having high e.e., was obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Table 2 shows results of reaction of a less sterically demanding ketone, acetone, with various aldehydes. The reactions shown in Table 2 were performed with both ligands 1a and 1 m (in which the 4-methyl phenol of 1a is replaced with 3,5-dimethyl phenol). Standard conditions were 0.5 mmol aldehyde, 0.5 ml (approx. 6.8 mmol) acetone, 100 mg 4 &angst; molecular sieves, a reaction temperature of 5&deg; C., and catalyst added as a 0.1 M solution in THF. (See Example 15.) In certain reactions, 5 eq of PPh<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>S per eq of catalyst were added, as indicated.

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Yields are isolated yields, with conversions given in parentheses. Product ratios were determined by <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR spectroscopy of the crude product, ande.e.&apos;s by chiral HPLC using chiracell OD or OJ columns. Absolute configurations were assigned by comparison to the literature or by analogy. (See characterizing data in Examples, below.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> With the exception of entry 1, somewhat improved results were obtained using ligand 1m over 1a under otherwise identical conditions. For an &agr;-branched aldehyde (entry 4), a slight improvement in yield and a significant improvement in e.e. was obtained. In the difficult cases of &agr;-unbranched and aryl aldehydes, significant improvements arose using ligand 1m. In all cases (entries 5-9), improvements in yields were obtained, frequently due to a decrease in the elimination side product. In some cases, notably entry 5, e.e. was also higher with ligand 1m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Enantioselectivities observed in reaction of branched aldehydes with acetophenone were higher than those shown in Table 2 for acetone. For example, e.e.&apos;s for the reaction products of the aldehydes of entries 1, 2, and 4 with acetophenone were 98-99%. Absolute configurations were the same for the acetone and acetophenone reaction products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> For &agr;-unbranched aldehyde substrates, the catalysts derived from reaction of ligand 1a or 1 m with 2 eq of diethylzinc give the best recorded results to date. In comparative reactions using proline as the chiral auxiliary, the unbranched aldehydes shown in Table 2 gave aldol products in yields and e.e.&apos;s ranging from 22-35% and 36-73%, respectively. Reactions using ligand lm, in contrast, gave yields and e.e.&apos;s from 59-76% and 82-89%, respectively. The results are also considerably improved over the use of Ipc-X (Ipc&equals;isopinocampheyl; X&equals;Cl or OSO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) as a chiral auxiliary, which must be used in stoichiometric quantities (Ramachandran et al.; Paterson et al.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Methyl vinyl ketone has been recognized as a useful building block in organic synthesis. Therefore, the aldol reaction of MVK as a nucleophile was also examined, using a zinc complex of ligand 1a as catalyst. The reaction employed 0.5 mmol cyclohexane carboxaldehyde and ca. 10 mol % ligand/10 mol % metal (see Example 16). Products with high enantiomeric excess were obtained, as shown. Dehydration of the aldol product, however, decreased the yields.

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In this series of reactions, ligands Ic and im gave the highest e.e.&apos;s at moderate temperatures. Reactions with ligands based on &bgr;-cresol, similar to 1a, but having larger aryl groups on the tertiary alcohol groups, gave results similar to or somewhat superior to those using 1a. These ligands include naphthyl ligands 1c-d and biphenyl ligand 1e (data not shown for 1d-1e). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> See also section B3, below, for further discussion of variations in ligand structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, &agr;-hydroxyketones have been particularly interesting synthetic subunits, due to the desirability of the polyoxygenated products, but they have presented serious chemoselectivity problems in aldol reactions. Reactions using the present catalysts, however, were very effective, giving high yields and e.e.&apos;s in asymmetric aldol reactions with a wide range of aldehydes, including branched and non-branched. These reactions also gave high yields from nearly stoichiometric ketone/aldehyde ratios. Surprisingly, the enantiofacial selectivity with respect to the aldehyde was opposite to that observed with the methyl ketones, above (Table 1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Table 5 shows results of the reaction of hydroxyacetophenone and cyclohexane carboxaldehyde, in a 1.5:1 molar ratio, in the presence of 2.5 to 5 mole % catalyst (prepared by reacting equimolar amounts of ligand 1a and diethylzinc in THF). Reactions were run on a 0.5 mmol scale at 0.3M aldehyde, in the presence of 100 mg 4A molecular sieves and 15 mole % Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The reaction gave a high yield of the desired aldol product, with high diastereoselectivity, favoring the syn adduct as shown (d.r.&equals;diastereomeric ratio). Lowering reaction temperature improved e.e. dramatically. In contrast to results observed with acetophenone, the presence or absence of Ph<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>PS at &minus;35&deg; C. had no effect (entries 6-7). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Diastereomeric ratio (dr) was largely invariant with respect to temperature. However, it was found, remarkably, that lowering the catalyst load to 2.5 mol % (entry 8) gave a significant increase in diastereoselectivity with no appreciable loss in yield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The relative and absolute stereochemistry of the major diastereomer was established by comparison to the product as derived from an asymmetric dihydroxylation (see Example 15). Strikingly, the absolute configuration of the stereocenter derived from the aldehyde is opposite to that obtained using acetophenone as donor.

<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Table 6 illustrates the versatility of this reaction using a variety of aldehyde substrates. Reactions were run on a 0.5 mmol scale at 0.3M aldehyde, in the presence of 2.5 to 5 mole % catalyst (prepared as described in Example 18) and 100 mg 4A molecular sieves. Reactions were carried out at &minus;35&deg; C. for 24 h, unless otherwise indicated. The reaction of entry 6 was carried out at &minus;55&deg; C. Yields are isolated yields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Notably, the reaction gave high e.e.&apos;s from unbranched substrates (entries 5-8 and 10). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Decreasing the temperature (entry 6) gave an increase in e.e., as well as diastereoselectivity. Reactions with 2-hydroxyacetylfuran as the donor ketone also gave excellent results (entries 9 and 10). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Reducing the ratio of substrates from 1.5:1 to 1.3:1 (entries 9a and 10) had no deleterious effect on conversion or chemoselectivity. As shown in entry 2a vs. 2b, reducing this ratio further to 1.1:1.0 decreased conversion, but both the diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity increased. A similar trend was observed with 3-methylbutanal (entry 4a vs. 4b). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In all cases examined (entries 1-5), dropping the catalyst load from 5 to 2.5 mol % increased diastereoselectivity and, in some cases (entries 2-4), e.e. significantly.

<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the asymmetric aldol reaction over asymmetric dihydroxylation in producing chiral 1,2-diols is the formation of both stereocenters simultaneous with carbon-carbon bond formation. Further, in an asymmetric dihydroxylation, chemoselectivity issues could arise with olefinic substrates, such as that of Table 3, entry 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The reaction described above approaches the ideal atom economical version of the asymmetric aldol reaction, employing near-stoichiometric amounts of substrate and donor and catalytic amounts of other reagents. Excellent conversion and chemoselectivity was observed with ketone/aldehyde ratios as low as 1.1:1.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> B. Nitroalkyl Donors (Nitroaldol or Hemv Reaction) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The nitroaldol reaction provides a method of forming a carbon-carbon bond under relatively mild conditions with the concomitant formation of two asymmetric centers. The resulting &bgr;-nitroalcohol product is amenable to further transformation to additional useful structures, e.g. by reduction of the nitro group, oxidation of the alcohol, etc. In accordance with the present invention, the nitroaldol reaction can be carried out between an aldehyde and a nitroalkyl compound with high stereoselectivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> As noted above, a &ldquo;nitroalkyl&rdquo; compound refers to a compound which contains a nitromethyl (&mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) or nitromethylene (&gt;CHNO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) moiety and is able to form a stable carbanion on abstraction of an oc-hydrogen, the simplest example being nitromethane (CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). Nitroaldol reactions can also been carried out on nitroalkyl compounds which include other functional groups, such as alcohols, ethers, including acetals and ketals, thioethers, ketones, esters, including a:- and Festers, acyloxy groups, amines, amides, and imides (see the 2001 review article by Luzzio, cited above). Such substrates are expected to be suitable for the reactions described herein, keeping in mind that when &bgr;-branching is present (i.e. a nitromethylene compound), mixtures of diastereomers may be formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> 1. Reaction Parameters </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Table 7 shows the results of a series of reactions of cyclohexane carboxaldehyde with nitromethane using catalyst 1a. A 0.1M catalyst solution, which may be prepared as described in Example 20A, was added directly to the reaction solution containing nitromethane and the aldehyde substrate. All reactions were run on a 1 mmol scale at 0.33 M in aldehyde in the solvent shown, containing about 100 mg of 4A molecular sieves per 1 mmol of aldehyde. Reactions were carried out for 24 hrs (see Example 20B). Enantiomeric excess of the products was determined by chiral HPLC.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> While only small amounts of catalyst (e.g. 2.5 mole %, entry 8) were effective to give high e.e.&apos;s, about 5 mole % catalyst, along with about 5 equivalents of the nitroalkyl compound relative to aldehyde, were needed to give high conversions. In the cases where low yields were obtained (entries 5, 6 and 8), the aldehyde was recovered unchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> While moderate enantioselectivity was obtained at 5&deg; C., significant improvements were seen upon lowering the temperature. Preferably, the reaction mixture is cooled at &minus;78&deg; C. during addition of the catalyst (entries 7-9), and the reaction allowed to proceed at a temperature of about &minus;60&deg; C. to &minus;20&deg; C. In similar reactions run with isopropyl and pivalyl aldehyde, an absolute increase in e.e. of 5% was seen in both cases on going from a reaction temperature of &minus;25&deg; C. to &minus;60&deg; C. (isopropyl 83% to 88%; pivalyl 88% to 93%). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> A clear benefit was also observed from the use of coordinating polar solvents such as THF, DME and dioxane. </paragraph>

All reactions in the Table were carried out on a 1 mmol (aldehyde) scale, using 5 mol % catalyst (prepared from ligand 1a, as described in Example 20A) and 10 eq.

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Enantiomeric excess was determined by chiral HPLC. The e.e. of the product of entry 5 was increased to 96% by one recrystallization. Absolute stereochemistry of the products was determined by comparison to literature values and/or by NMR analysis of the (S)&mdash;O-methylmandelate derivatives (see e.g. Example 21). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> &agr;-Branched aldehydes gave nitro aldol products in high yields and e.e. (entries 1-3). Entries 1-2 were carried out at &minus;60&deg; C., using only 5 eq. CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Reasonable yields were obtained from &agr;-unbranched aldehydes by increasing the nitroalkane/adhehyde equivalent ratio to 15 and by performing the reaction using more concentrated solutions (entries 5 and 6). Reaction 5 a was performed using 15 eq. CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>NO2 and 5 mol % catalyst in 0.66 M THF solution for 2 days; reactions 5b and 6 were performed using 15 eq. CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>NO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 10 mol % catalyst in 0.33 M THF solution for 2 days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Enantiomerically pure (R)-citronellal (entry 7) gave the nitro aldol product in high yield and high diastereomeric ratio. However, (S)-citronellal gave the corresponding product (not shown) in 51% yield and 9.6:1 diastereomeric ratio. Aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes gave nitro aldol products in good yields and good e.e. as well (entries 8-11). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> 3. Ligand Variations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> The reaction of Entry 10 in Table 8 was also carried out with catalysts prepared from different ligands. When the 4-methyl group of ligand 1a was replaced with fluorine, an increase in e.e. to 85% was observed. Similar increases were observed when the phenyl groups on the diaryl carbinol moieties of 1a were replaced with 4-fluorophenyl, &bgr;-biphenyl, or 2-naphthyl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> 4. Further Reactions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The catalyst system reported herein allows efficient and atom economical access to enantiomerically enriched &agr;-hydroxy amines and ax-hydroxy acids which are important building blocks in organic synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The product of entry 6 is a useful bifunctional molecule that could serve, for example, as starting material for the rapid production of &ldquo;GABOB&rdquo; (y-amino-p-hydroxy butyric acid). The product of entry 10 could be used as starting material for the synthesis of arbutamine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The nitro aldol products can also be further elaborated into chiral &agr;-hydroxy acids (Matt et al.) without epimerization of the stereogenic center (see below and Examples 22-23).

<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> This solution (0.25 mL) was added to a suspension of powdered 4A molecular sieves (100 mg, dried at 150&deg; C. under vacuum overnight), aldehyde (0.5 mmol), and hydroxymethyl aryl ketone (0.75 mmol) in THF (1.5 mL) at &minus;35&deg; C. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1-2d. The reaction mixture was poured onto 1N HCl and extracted with ether. The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue purified by silica gel column chromatography. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to speech processing techniques and, more particularly, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for performing prosody-based speech processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Speech processing is used to produce signals for controlling devices or software programs, transcription of speech into written words, extraction of specific information from speech, classification of speech into document categories, archival and late retrieval of such information, and other related tasks. All such speech processing tasks are faced with the problem of locating within the speech signal suitable speech segments for processing. Segmenting the speech signal simplifies the signal processing required to identify words. Since spoken language is not usually produced with explicit indicators of such segments, segmentation within a speech processor may occur with respect to commands, sentences, paragraphs or topic units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For example, a system that is controlled by voice commands needs to determine when a command uttered by a user is complete, i.e., when the system can stop waiting for further input and begin interpreting the command. The process used to determine whether a speaker has completed an utterance, e.g., a sentence or command, is known as endpointing. Generally, endpointing is performed by measuring the length of a pause in the speech signal. If the pause is sufficiently long, the endpointing process deems the utterance complete. However, endpointing processes that rely on pause duration are fraught with errors. For example, many times a speaker will pause in mid-sentence while thinking about what is to be said next. An endpointing process that is based upon pause sensing will identify such pauses as occurring at the end of a sentence, when that is not the case. Consequently, the speech recognition processing that is relying upon accurate endpointing will erroneously process the speech signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus that accurately identifies an endpoint in a speech signal. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally provides a method and apparatus for finding endpoints in speech by utilizing information contained in speech prosody. Prosody denotes the way speakers modulate the timing, pitch and loudness of phones, words, and phrases to convey certain aspects of meaning; informally, prosody includes what is perceived as the &ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; and &ldquo;melody&rdquo; of speech. Because speakers use prosody to convey units of speech to listeners (e.g., a change in pitch is used to indicate that a speaker has completed a sentence), the invention performs endpoint detection by extracting and interpreting the relevant prosodic properties of speech. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, referred to as &ldquo;pre-recognition endpointing&rdquo;, prosodic properties are extracted prior to word recognition, and are used to infer when a speaker has completed a spoken command or utterance. The use of prosodic cues leads to a faster and more reliable determination that the intended end of an utterance has been reached. This prevents incomplete or overly long stretches of speech from being sent to subsequent speech processing stages. Furthermore, because the prosodic information used to make the endpointing determination only includes speech uttered up to the potential endpoint, endpointing can be performed in real-time while the user is speaking. The endpointing method extracts a series of prosodic parameters relating to the pitch and pause durations within the speech signal. The parameters are analyzed to generate an endpoint signal that represents the occurrence of an endpoint within the speech signal. The endpoint signal may be a posterior probability that represents the likelihood that an endpoint has occurred at any given point in the speech signal or a binary signal indicating that an endpoint has occurred.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The endpoint signal may be a binary signal that identifies the occurrence of an endpoint or the endpoint signal may be a continuously generated signal that indicates a probability that an endpoint has occurred at any moment in time. At step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the endpoint signal and the speech signal are coupled to an application program such as a speech recognition program, a speech-to-text translation program and the like. These programs use the endpoint signal to facilitate speech signal segmentation and word recognition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The dashed line <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> represents the iterative nature of the endpointing process. Each sample of the speech signal is processed to generate the endpoint signal, then the next sample is processed. The new sample will be used to update the endpoint signal. As such, a continuous flow of endpointing information is generated as the speech signal is processed. Thus, endpoint information can be supplied in real-time or near-real-time depending on the computing speed that is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a processing architecture <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> that performs prosodic feature extraction and modeling in accordance with the present invention. The architecture <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises a pause analysis module <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, a duration pattern module <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and a pitch processing module <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Each of these modules represents executable software for performing a particular function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The pause analysis module <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> performs a conventional &ldquo;speech/no-speech&rdquo; algorithm that detects when a pause in the speech occurs. The output is a binary value that indicates whether the present speech signal sample is a portion of speech or not a portion of speech. This module <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is considered optional for use in the inventive method to facilitate generation of additional information that can be used to identify an endpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The duration pattern module <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> analyzes whether phones are lengthened with respect to average phone durations for the speaker. The lengthening of phones is indicative of the speaker not being finished speaking. The output of module <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may be a binary signal (e.g., the phone is longer than average, thus output a one; otherwise output a zero) or a probability that indicates the likelihood that the speaker has completed speaking in view of the phone length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The pitch processing module <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> is used to extract certain pitch parameters from the speech signal that are indicative of the speaker has completed an utterance. The module <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> extracts a fundamental pitch frequency (fo) from the speech signal and stylizes &ldquo;pitch movements&rdquo; of the speech signal (i.e., tracks the variations in pitch over time). Within the module <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, at step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a pitch contour is generated as a correlated sequence of pitch values. The speech signal is sampled at an appropriate rate, e.g., 8 kHz, 16 kHz and the like. The pitch parameters are extracted and computed (modeled) as discussed in K. Sonmez et al., &ldquo;Modeling Dynamic Prosodic Variation for Speaker Verification&rdquo;, Proc. Intl. Conf. on Spoken Language Processing, Vol. 7, pp 3189-3192 (1998) which is incorporated herein by reference. The sequence can be modeled in a piecewise linear model or in a polynomial of a given degree as a spline. At step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a pitch movement model is produced from the pitch contour using a finite state automaton or a stochastic Markov model. The model estimates the sequence of pitch movements. At steps <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, the module <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> extracts pitch features from the model, where the pitch features signal whether the speaker intended to stop, pause, continue speaking or ask a question. The features include the pitch movement slope (step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>) and the pitch translation from a baseline pitch (step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>). Baseline processing is disclosed in E. Shriberg et al. &ldquo;Prosody-Based Automatic Segmentation of Speech into Sentences and Topics&rdquo;, Speech Communication, Vol. 32, Nos. 1-2, pp 127-154 (2000). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> More particularly, step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> produces a unique speaker-normalization value that is estimated using a lognormal tied mixture approach to modeling speaker pitch. Such a model is disclosed by Sonmez et al in the paper cited above. The technique compares the present pitch estimate with a baseline pitch value that is recalled from a database <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The database contains baseline pitch data for all expected speakers. If a speaker&apos;s pitch is near the baseline pitch, they have likely completed the utterance. If, on the other hand, the pitch is above the baseline, the speaker is probably not finished with the utterance. As such, the comparison to the baseline enables the system to identify a possible endpoint, e.g., falling pitch prior to a pause. An utterance that ends in a question generally has a rising pitch movement slope, so that the baseline difference information can be combined with the pitch movement slope feature to identify an endpoint of a question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The pitch contour generation step (step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) may include the voicing process that produces a value that represents whether the sample is a portion of a voiced speech sound. In other words, the module identifies whether the sampled sound is speech or some other sound that can be disregarded by the endpointing process. The value is either a binary value or a probability (e.g., a value ranging from 0 to 100 that indicates a likelihood that the sound is speech). In one embodiment the voice process may couple information to the pitch processing module <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> to ensure that the pitch processing is only performed on voice signals. Pitch information is not valid for non-voice signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> At step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the extracted prosodic features are combined in either a data-driven fashion (i.e., estimated from an endpoint-labeled set of utterances, to generate predictors relevant to endpointing or using an a priori rule set that is generated by linguistic reasoning. Combinations of both approaches may be used. The output is a endpoint signal that represents the occurrence of an endpoint in the speech signal. The endpoint signal may take the form of a binary signal that identifies when an endpoint has occurred or the endpoint signal may be a posterior probability that provides a likelihood that the speech signal at any point in time is an endpoint (e.g., a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is no chance of the speech being at an endpoint and 100 identifying that the speech is certainly at an endpoint). The endpoint signal may contain multiple posterior probabilities such as a probability that the utterance is finished, the probability that a pause is due to hesitation, and the probability that the speaker is talking fluently. The posterior probability or probabilities are produced on a continuous basis and are updated with changes in the detected prosodic features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The forgoing embodiment extracts the features of the speech signal &ldquo;on-the-fly&rdquo; in real-time or near real-time. However, the invention may also be used in a non-real-time word recognition system to enhance the word recognition process. For example, the features may be extracted at a frame level (e.g., with respect to a group of speech samples that are segmented from the continuous speech signal). Additional frame-level features can be extracted that represent duration related features based on the phone level transcription output. Such features include speaker-and utterance-normalized duration of vowels, syllables, and rhymes (the last part of a syllable, or nucleus plus coda). Such features can provide a continuously updated posterior probability of utterance endpoint to enhance the speech recognition accuracy, i.e., information regarding vowels, syllables, and so on is useful for the speech recognition system to identify particular words. Furthermore, the additional information that is extracted because of the availability of segments of speech to analyze can be used to enhance the endpointing posterior probability. In effect, an initial posterior probability that was generated in real-time (pre-recognition processing), could later be updated when a frame-level analysis is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the introduction of DNA episomes into plant cells to silence plant genes. More particularly, this invention relates to the use of geminivirus vectors to provide silencing of one or more endogenous genes in treated plants. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Gene silencing in plants typically refers to the suppression of either an endogenous gene or ectopically-integrated transgene by the introduction of a related transgene. Some examples of pathogen-derived host resistance to RNA viruses have been attributed to a gene silencing mechanism (Covey et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>386, 781 (1997); Mueller et al., <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>7, 1001 (1995); Ratcliff et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>276, 1558 (1997); Tanzer et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>9, 1411 (1997)). Transcriptional gene silencing has been hypothesized to involve DNA/DNA pairing, DNA methylation or heterochromatinization (Kumpatia et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>115, 361 (1997); Neuhuber, <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genetics </italic></highlight>247, 264 (1995); Jones et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>17, 6385 (1998); Park et al., <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>9, 183 (1996)). Repeated DNA has a tendency to undergo transcriptional silencing, which may be associated with changes in chromatin structure (Meyer, <highlight><italic>Biol. Chem. Hoppe Sayler </italic></highlight>377, 87 (1996); Ye and Singer, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>93, 10881 (1996)), and/or to induce certain types of post-transcriptional silencing (Stam et al., <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>12, 63 (1997)). Both cytoplasmic and nuclear events have been implicated in gene silencing. Post-transcriptional gene silencing may involve the synthesis of short RNA molecules, synthesized by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Cogoni and Macino, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>399, 166 (1999)), that anneal to homologous sense RNA and thereby provide a target for a double-stranded RNase or affect RNA abundance indirectly by interfering with translation (Baulcombe, <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>32, 79 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Geminiviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses that replicate through double-stranded DNA intermediates using plant DNA replication machinery. Geminiviruses replicate in the nucleus, and foreign DNA can be stably integrated into the viral genome without significantly affecting replication or movement. Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) and cabbage leaf curl virus (CbLCV) are bipartite geminiviruses with genomes consisting of two circular components, A and B (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The A component replicates autonomously whereas the B component is dependent on the A component for replication. For TGMV, the coat protein (AR1, also known as V1) is dispensable for replication and movement in <highlight><italic>Nicotiana Benthamiana </italic></highlight>and can be replaced with up to 800 bp of foreign DNA, which is stably maintained in the viral genome (Elmer and Rogers, <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res. </italic></highlight>18, 2001 (1990)). Similarly, the CbLCV coat protein can be replaced with foreign DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A plant virus may systemically infect a plant by spreading from the initially-infected cell to neighboring cells, and subsequently throughout the plant. Plant cell walls prevent the random cell-to-cell transfer of the virus, but channels (plasmodesmata) that transverse plant cell walls provide an intercellular continuum through which the virus particles or viral nucleic acids may move. Viral movement via plasmodesmata is mediated by virus encoded proteins (Citovsky et al., <highlight><italic>Bioassays </italic></highlight>13, 373 (1991)). Additionally, movement of the virus to parts of the plant distant from the site of the initial infection can occur via companion cells and sieve elements of the phloem. However, even in systemically infected plants the distribution of the virus may not be uniform. Certain areas of the plant, even within a plant tissue or a structure, may contain higher or lower amounts of virus than neighboring areas. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present investigations demonstrate that episomes derived from DNA plant viruses (preferably, geminiviruses) can effect silencing of active chromosomal gene expression in plants, i.e., can produce gene silencing. Preferably, the episomal silencing vectors are localized to the nucleus of the plant cell. The silencing vector comprises one or more heterologous DNA sequences, each of which has substantial sequence similarity with an endogenous plant gene or a fragment thereof (including coding and/or non-coding sequences). The silencing of nuclear genes can be achieved by the homologous sequences carried by the DNA episome. The present invention advantageously permits silencing of gene expression in intact plants, without the need for transformation followed by regeneration of entire plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A first aspect of the present invention is a Cabbage Leaf Curl Virus (CbLCV) silencing vector comprising a CbLCV genomic component comprising one or more heterologous DNA sequences, where each heterologous DNA sequence is identical to, or has substantial sequence similarity to, a gene endogenous to a plant (including fragments thereof). In particular embodiments, the CbLCV genomic component is the A or the B component, or a binary vector comprising both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the present invention is a vector comprising a CbLCV A component, where the DNA encoding the CbLCV coat protein has been replaced in part or in total with one or more heterologous DNA sequences, each of which is identical to, or has substantial sequence similarity to, an endogenous plant gene (including fragments thereof). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A still further aspect of the present invention is a vector comprising a CbLCV B component, wherein one or more heterologous DNA sequences, each of which is identical to or has substantial sequence similarity to an endogenous plant gene or fragment thereof, is inserted into or replaces sequences within the B component. In preferred embodiments, at least one of the sequences is inserted into or replaces sequences in the 3&prime; non-coding region of the BR1 and/or BL1 genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the present invention is a silencing vector comprising a CbLCV origin of replication; CbLCV sequences encoding proteins sufficient for replication of the vector in a plant cell; and one or more heterologous DNA sequences that are each identical to, or have substantial sequence similarity to, an endogenous plant gene (including fragments thereof). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A yet further aspect of the present invention is a silencing vector comprising a CbLCV origin of replication; a CbLCV BR1 and/or BL1 gene (preferably both); and one or more heterologous DNA sequences that are each identical to, or have substantial sequence similarity to, one or more endogenous plant genes (including fragments thereof). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A further aspect of the present invention is a method of silencing (preferably, systemically) the expression of a plant gene in a plant cell by inoculating the plant cell with a silencing vector as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A still further aspect of the present invention is a method of screening isolated plant DNA sequences for function. The method comprises preparing a silencing vector as described above, containing one or more DNA sequences identical to, or having substantial sequence similarity to, the isolated plant DNA (including fragments thereof). A test plant is then inoculated with the silencing vector and allowed to grow for a period of time, then compared to a non-inoculated or sham inoculated control plant. Differences between the inoculated and control plants indicate the function of the isolated plant DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A still further aspect of the present invention is a method of screening plant DNA sequences for function. The method comprises preparing a silencing vector as described above, containing one or more DNA sequences identical to, or having substantial sequence similarity to, a plant gene (including fragments thereof). A test plant or a test plant tissue is then inoculated with the silencing vector and allowed to grow for a period of time, then compared to a non-inoculated or sham inoculated control plant or control plant tissue. Differences between the inoculated and control plant tissue indicate the function of the silenced plant gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In particular embodiments of the screening methods described herein, the same plant comprises the test plant and the control plant tissue. </paragraph>

Panel A shows the TGMV A and B genetic components; each contains a common region that includes the origin of replication. AL1, AL2 and AL3 are viral genes needed for replication and gene expression. The AR1 gene encodes the coat protein, which can be replaced with the insertion of foreign DNA at the multiple cloning site (MCS). The B component encodes two movement proteins, BL1 and BR1. The TGMV B component contains a unique Xbal site, 15 bp downstream of the BR1 ORF stop codon, engineered for insertion of foreign sequences. CR indicates the common region. Panel B shows the CbLCV A and B genetic components; each contains a common region that includes the origin of replication. AL1, AL2 and AL3 are viral genes needed for replication and gene expression. The AR1 gene encodes the coat protein, which can be replaced with the insertion of foreign DNA at the multiple cloning site (MCS). The B component encodes two movement proteins, BL1 and BR1. The CbLCV B component contains a naturally-occurring, unique HincII site upstream of the BR1 stop codon used for insertion of foreign sequences. CR indicates the common region. </paragraph>

Three weeks after bombardment, silencing appeared in CbLCV A::CH42 transformed plants. (yellow tissue; Panel C and D). There was no chlorosis in the empty vector control (Panel A and B). Wild type CbLCV does produce extensive chlorosis in leaves (Panel F), but the chlorosis is distinguishable from silencing (more brown-white than yellow-white).

Panel B shows an Arabidopsis plant transformed with CbLCV A::CH-42 alone; yellow spots are seen, but systemic silencing is absent due to the inability of the A component to move without the B component. Panels C and D show Arabidopsis plants transformed with wild type CbLCV A component and recombinant CbLCV B::CH-42. There is evidence of silencing in the transformed leaves, but not in the upper leaves yet. The BR1 gene in this construct was mutated inadvertently therefore possibly restricting the movement of the B component. All plants were photographed 12 days post infection. </paragraph>

Plant (Panel B) inoculated with TGMV A::790su/B::122PCNA and pruned (arrow) two weeks after inoculation showed silencing in axillary buds.

SCHILPEROORT, EDS., INTRODUCTION, EXPRESSION, AND ANALYSIS OF GENE PRODUCTION IN PLANTS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms &ldquo;a&rdquo; &ldquo;an&rdquo; and &ldquo;the&rdquo; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present investigations demonstrate that DNA carried on episomes can silence active, chromosomal gene expression, and that DNA plant viruses (and particularly geminiviruses) can provide a mechanism for the suppression of gene expression in intact plants (preferably, systemic suppression). The present inventors show that a nuclear-localized DNA virus (e.g., a geminivirus) carrying sequences complementary to (i.e., homologous to, or having substantial sequence similarity to) chromosomal genes can effect silencing of the chromosomal gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The present inventors determined that silencing of plant genes can be triggered by homologous sequences carried by a DNA episome, such as a geminivirus construct. Where the episome is capable of spreading from cell to cell in a plant (or capable of producing a diffusible silencing factor), systemic silencing of chromosomal genes can be achieved. Moreover, in at least some instances, silencing may be achieved in the absence of detectable transcription of the homologous gene sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Previous reports have demonstrated gene expression from geminivirus-derived episomes (reviewed in Timmermans et al., <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>45, 79, (1994)). A direct correlation between episome copy number and gene expression was shown in cultured cells for TGMV carrying the neo gene (Kanevski et al., <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>2, 457, (1992)). The present experiments differ in that there was no selection for gene expression, there was homology (i.e., sequence identity or substantial sequence similarity) between the episomal and chromosomal sequences, and only partial copies of the silenced endogenous genes (su, pcnA or gfp genes) were carried in episomes. Moreover, the sequences inserted into the inventive silencing vector may be in the sense or anti-sense orientation. Unlike the expression vector described by U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,992, the silencing vectors of the invention do not typically stably integrate into the plant genetic material and are not expressed in the seed. The present invention demonstrates silencing of chromosomal gene expression by episomal DNA; more specifically, the ability to silence endogenous gene expression systemically in a plant using a plant virus construct is demonstrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> There have also been reports of gene suppression in plants using Agrobacteria carrying sense and/or anti-sense sequences homologous to plant genes (Seymour et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Molecular Biology </italic></highlight>23, 1 (1993); Jones et al, (1996) Down-regulation of two non-homologous endogenous genes with a single chimeric gene construct, In: Grierson D., Lycett G W, Tucker G A (eds) Mechanisms and applications of gene silencing, Nottingham University Press, UK, pp. 85; Jones et al., <highlight><italic>Planta </italic></highlight>204, 499 (1998)). The approaches employed in these investigations have several disadvantages as compared with the present invention. For example, these methods typically require stable transformation followed by regeneration of entire plants. In contrast, the present invention permits the silencing of gene expression in mature plants, without the need for stable transformation (i.e., the silencing vector remains episomal) of individual plant cells and subsequent regeneration of whole plants. Thus, the present invention may be more suitable for rapid screening of gene function, e.g., functional genomic approaches. Further, the present invention may be advantageously employed to assess gene function, particularly in the case where the target or targets of gene suppression confer a lethal phenotype (e.g., knockouts for the magnesium chelatase gene). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In addition, the vectors of the present invention replicate as non-integrating episomes, thereby avoiding position effects and reducing the likelihood of chromosomal rearrangements or other alterations to the plant chromosomes, both of which raise concerns in methodologies utilizing integrating vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present methods also allow the suppression of plant gene expression without the modification of the germplasm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Kjemtrup et al., (1998) <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>14:91 and international patent publication WO 99/50429 describe gene silencing using geminivirus vectors. The investigations described herein demonstrate that insertion of homologous sequences into the B component of the bipartite geminivirus results in silencing (preferably, systemic silencing) of endogenous gene expression. Indeed, in some systems, geminivirus B component vectors give higher and/or more wide-spread silencing than do A component vectors. The present investigations have further discovered that surprisingly short sequences may be used to achieve silencing in plants. Moreover, the present invention provides the unexpected discovery that gene silencing, including systemic gene silencing, may be achieved by phloem-limited geminivirus (e.g., in cells outside of the phloem). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Geminiviruses and other DNA Viruses </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The geminiviruses are single-stranded plant DNA viruses. They possess a circular, single-stranded (ss) genomic DNA encapsidated in twinned &ldquo;geminate&rdquo; icosahedral particles. The encapsidated ss DNAs are replicated through circular double stranded DNA intermediates in the nucleus of the host cell, presumably by a rolling circle mechanism. Viral DNA replication, which results in the simulation of both single and double stranded viral DNAs in large amounts, involves the expression of only a small number of viral proteins that are necessary either for the replication process itself or facilitates replication or viral transcription. The geminiviruses therefore appear to rely primarily on the machinery of the host for viral replication and gene expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Geminiviruses are subdivided on the basis of host range in either monocots or dicots and whether the insect vector is a leaf hopper or a white fly species. Monocot-infecting geminiviruses are typically transmitted by leaf hoppers and their genome comprises a single ss DNA component about 2.7 kb in size (monopartite geminivirus). This type of genome, the smallest known infectious DNA, is typified by wheat dwarf virus which is one of a number from the subgroup that have been cloned and sequenced. Most geminiviruses that infect dicot hosts are transmitted by the white fly and possess a bipartite genome comprising similarly sized DNAs (usually termed A and B) as illustrated by African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) and potato yellow mosaic virus. For successful infection of plants, both genomic components are required. Beet curly top virus occupies a unique intermediary position between the above two subgroups as it infects dicots but contains only a single genomic component equivalent to DNA A, possibly as a result of adaptation to leaf hopper transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The bipartite subgroup contains only the viruses that infect dicots. Exemplary is the African Cassava Mosaic Virus (ACMV) and the Tomato Golden Mosaic Virus (TGMV). TGMV, like ACMV, is composed of two circular DNA molecules of the same size, both of which are required for infectivity. Sequence analysis of the two genome components reveals six open reading frames (ORFs); four of the ORFs are encoded by DNA A and two by DNA B. On both components, the ORFs diverge from a conserved 230 nucleotide intergenic region (common region) and are transcribed bidirectionally from double stranded replicative form DNA. The ORFs are named according to genome component and orientation relative to the common region (i.e., left versus right). The AL2 gene product transactivates expression of the TGMV coat protein gene, which is also sometimes known as &ldquo;AR1&rdquo;. Functions have not yet been attributed to some of the ORFs in the geminivirus genomes. However, it is known that certain proteins are involved in the replication of viral DNA (REP genes). See, e.g., Elmer et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>16, 7043 (1988); Hatta and Francki, <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>92, 428 (1979). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The A genome component contains all viral information necessary for the replication and encapsidation of viral DNA, while the B component encodes functions required for movement of the virus through the infected plant. The DNA A component of these viruses is capable of autonomous replication in plant cells in the absence of DNA B when inserted as a greater than full-length copy into the genome of plant cells, or when a copy is electroporated into plant cells. In monopartite geminivirus genomes, the single genomic component contains all viral information necessary for replication, encapsidation, and movement of the virus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The geminivirus A component carries the AL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (also known as C1 or REP), the AL2 (also known as C2 or TRAP), AL3 (also known as C3 or REN), and AR1 (also known as V1 or coat protein) sequences. The geminivirus B component carries the BR1(also known as BV1) and BR1 (also known as BC1) sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Little is known about the interaction of geminiviruses with their hosts. Because they replicate to high copy numbers in plant nuclei, they may have evolved mechanisms to evade homology sensing and silencing mechanisms. The present inventors have determined that insertion of plant DNA into the geminivirus genome can trigger gene silencing in the host plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As used herein, geminiviruses encompass viruses of the Genus Mastrevirus, Genus Curtovirus, and Genus Begomovirus.

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Badnaviruses are a genus of plant viruses having double-stranded DNA genomes. Specific badnavirus include cacao swollen shoot virus and rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). Most badnavirus have a narrow host range and are transmitted by insect vectors. In the badnaviruses, a single open reading frame (ORF) may encode the movement protein, coat protein, protease and reverse transcriptase; proteolytic processing produces the final products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Exemplary Badnaviruses include, but are not limited to Commelina Yellow Mottle Virus, Banana Streak Virus, Cacao Swollen Shoot Virus, Canna Yellow Mottle Virus, Dioscorea Bacilliform Virus, Kalanchoe Top-Spotting Virus, Piper Yellow Mottle Virus, Rice Tungro Bacilliform Virus, Schefflera Ringspot Virus, Sugarcane Bacilliform Virus, Aucuba Bacilliform Virus, Mimosa Baciliform Virus, Taro Bacilliform Virus, Yucca Bacilliform Virus, Rubus Yellow Net Virus, Sweet Potato Leaf Curl Virus, Yam Internal Brown Spot Virus, and any other virus designated as a Badnavirus by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Caulimoviruses have double-stranded circular DNA genomes that replicate through a reverse transcriptase-mediated process, although the virus DNA is not integrated into the host genome.

As used herein, Nanoviruses include but are not limited to Banana Bunchy Top Nanavirus, Coconut Foliar Decay Nanavirus, Faba Bean Necrotic Yellows Nanavirus, Milk Vetch Dwarf Nanavirus, and any other virus designated as a Nanovirus by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Episomally-Mediated Gene Silencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides methods of silencing endogenous plant genes (as defined below) using DNA episomes, and provides constructs for use in such methods. The episomal DNA carries one or more heterologous DNA sequences, where each sequence is homologous (i.e., has substantial sequence homology) to an endogenous plant gene(s) to be silenced, or homologous to a fragment of the endogenous plant gene to be silenced. The DNA episomes are preferentially able to replicate to multiple copy numbers in plant nuclei; where systemic silencing is desired, the episome is preferably able to move from cell-to-cell in the plant or to induce the movement of a diffusible suppression factor (or &ldquo;silencing factor&rdquo;), in order to enter and affect cells remote from the initial point of inoculation. The gene silencing may result in an altered phenotype; &ldquo;altered phenotype&rdquo; as used herein includes alterations in characteristics that can be visually observed (e.g., color), measured (e.g., average height or other growth characteristics) or biochemically assessed (e.g., presence of amounts of target gene products, including RNA, protein, or peptide products, or downstream biochemical pathway products). Visual observations include observations that employ microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As used herein, an &ldquo;endogenous&rdquo; plant gene refers to a plant gene found in the chromosomal DNA of the plant, i.e., a gene that occurs naturally in the plant nuclear or plastid genomes, preferably, the nuclear genome. In particular embodiments, the invention may be used to silence a transgene that has been integrated into the plant genetic material, e.g, by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation or ballistic bombardment). For example, a gene encoding a reporter protein or peptide may be introduced into the plant and serve as a marker in gene suppression studies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;silenced&rdquo; or &ldquo;gene silencing&rdquo; refers to a reduction in the expression product of a target gene. Silencing may occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Silencing may be assessed on the cellular level (i.e., by assessing the gene products in a particular cell), or at the plant tissue level (assessing silencing in a particular type of plant tissue) or at the level of the entire plant. Silencing may be complete, in that no final gene product is produced, or partial, in that a substantial reduction in the accumulation of gene product occurs. Such reduction may result in accumulations of gene product that are less than 90%, less than 75%, less than 50%, less than 30%, less than 20%, less than 10%, less than 5%, or even less than that produced by non-silenced genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;systemic silencing&rdquo; refers to the silencing of genes in plants, plant cells, or plant tissues, where gene silencing occurs in cells that are remote from the site of initial inoculation of the DNA-silencing episome. Applicants do not wish to be held to a single theory of systemic silencing; systemic silencing may occur by the replication and cell-to-cell movement of DNA constructs, or by the movement of a mobile silencing factor. Systemic silencing does not require that every tissue or every cell of the plant be affected, as the effects and extent of silencing may vary from tissue to tissue, or among cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It is not necessary that the episomal silencing constructs of the invention include viral movement protein genes to accomplish gene silencing. The present inventors have determined that episomal-mediated gene silencing may be achieved in the absence of the viral movement proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As a further aspect, the present invention provides the novel discovery that gene silencing, and preferably systemic gene silencing, may be achieved with phloem-limited geminivirus silencing vectors in cells and tissues outside of the phloem. This finding is of interest, as most characterized geminiviruses are believed to be phloem-limited. Indeed, in some systems, higher levels of silencing may be advantageously achieved with phloem-limited geminivirus vectors. While not wishing to be held to any particular theory of the invention, it appears that a viral anti-silencing signal may be obviated by limiting the vector to the phloem, thereby resulting in higher levels of gene suppression. Alternatively, it appears that restricting the virus to the phloem tissue may advantageously reduce the pathology of the virus in the host plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in particular preferred embodiments of the invention, the silencing vector is phloem-limited, as that term is understood in the art. The silencing vector may be a geminivirus silencing vector that is derived from a geminivirus genomic component that is naturally phloem-limited (e.g., derived from the A component or B component of a phloem-limited geminivirus). Alternatively, the silencing vector may be phloem-limited as a result of a phloem-limiting mutation, e.g., the Ala5 mutation in the TGMV genomic A component (in the AL1 gene) as described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/289,346 to Hanley-Bowdoin et al. This mutation results in a KEE&rarr;AAA mutation at amino acids 143-146 in the AL1 protein (within helix 4 of the oligomerization domain). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In still other preferred embodiments, the silencing vector comprises a Leu&rarr;ALA mutation at amino acid residue 148 in the TGMV genomic A component (in the AL1 gene). This mutation results in phloem limitation of the virus, and also appears to result in higher levels of DNA replication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that these mutations (i.e., Ala5 and Leu<highlight><subscript>148</subscript></highlight>&rarr;Ala<highlight><subscript>148 </subscript></highlight>may be incorporated into the corresponding positions of the genomic DNA of other geminiviruses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As still a further aspect, the present invention provides gene silencing vectors in which a heterologous DNA sequence having substantial sequence similarity to an endogenous plant gene (including gene fragments) is inserted in the 3&prime; non-coding region of a viral gene, so that the DNA sequence is co-transcribed with the viral gene, but is not translated. In some systems, increased spread of silencing is achieved using this method. Gene silencing vectors from any plant DNA virus may be modified to carry heterologous DNA sequences according to this method (preferably, geminivirus silencing vectors). For example, the heterologous DNA sequence can be inserted downstream of genes in the A component (AL1, AL2, AL3, AR1) or the B component (BLI, BR1) of a bipartite geminivirus, the single component of monopartite geminiviruses, or any of the genes of a plant DNA virus such as a nanovirus, badnavirus, or caulimovirus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;DNA silencing episome&rdquo; or &ldquo;DNA silencing vector&rdquo; refers to a DNA construct capable of replicating within a host cell, and carrying one or more heterologous (or &ldquo;recombinant&rdquo;) DNA sequences, where each sequence is substantially similar or identical in nucleotide sequence to an endogenous host plant gene (including fragments of the plant gene). Typically, and preferably, the DNA silencing episomes of the invention are localized to the nucleus of the host cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a heterologous sequence that has &ldquo;substantial sequence similarity to an endogenous plant gene&rdquo; has substantial sequence similarity at the nucleotide level to an endogenous plant gene, as described above, or a fragment of the plant gene, including the coding sequences of the gene and non-coding sequences (including intron sequences and 5&prime; and 3&prime; untranslated sequences). A &ldquo;fragment&rdquo; of a plant gene is a polynucleotide sequence that is shorter in length than the full-length gene, and may be a sequence of at least 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 500, 700, or more, contiguous nucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;substantial sequence similarity&rdquo; it is meant that the heterologous DNA sequence is of sufficient sequence similarity to the endogenous gene that silencing of the endogenous gene occurs upon introduction of the episome. Such DNA sequences are substantially similar in nucleotide sequence to the endogenous sequence (including fragments thereof) to be silenced; the heterologous DNA sequence may have from 60% sequence similarity, 70% sequence similarity, 75% sequence similarity, 80% sequence similarity, 85% sequence similarity, 90% sequence similarity, 95% sequence similarity, or even 97% or 98% sequence similarity, or more, to the target endogenous sequence (or a fragment thereof). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As is known in the art, a number of different programs can be used to identify whether a nucleic acid has sequence identity or similarity to a known sequence. Sequence identity and/or similarity may be determined using standard techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, the local sequence identity algorithm of Smith &amp; Waterman, <highlight><italic>Adv. Appl. Math. </italic></highlight>2, 482 (1981), by the sequence identity alignment algorithm of Needleman &amp; Wunsch, <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>48,443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson &amp; Lipman, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85,2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.), the Best Fit sequence program described by Devereux et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 12, 387-395 (1984), preferably using the default settings, or by inspection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> An example of a useful algorithm is PILEUP. PILEUP creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pairwise alignments. It can also plot a tree showing the clustering relationships used to create the alignment. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng &amp; Doolittle, <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Evol. </italic></highlight>35, 351-360 (1987); the method is similar to that described by Higgins &amp; Sharp CABIOS 5, 151-153 (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Another example of a useful algorithm is the BLAST algorithm, described in Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>215, 403-410, (1990) and Karlin et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90, 5873-5787 (1993). A particularly useful BLAST program is the WU-BLAST-2 program which was obtained from Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology, </italic></highlight>266, 460-480 (1996); http://blast.wustl/edu/blast/README.html. WU-BLAST-2 uses several search parameters, which are preferably set to the default values. The parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself depending upon the composition of the particular sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of interest is being searched; however, the values may be adjusted to increase sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> An additional useful algorithm is gapped BLAST as reported by Altschul et al. <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>25, 3389-3402. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;% sequence similarity&rdquo; as used herein indicates the percentage of nucleotide residues in the heterologous sequence that are identical with the nucleotide residues in the target endogenous plant gene sequence (including fragments thereof). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;heterologous DNA&rdquo; contained on the DNA silencing episome refers to DNA that is not naturally found in conjunction with the DNA episomal construct, i.e., that has been introduced by genetic engineering techniques. The heterologous DNA is of a size sufficient to silence the endogenous target gene (see below). The heterologous DNA may be in sense or antisense orientation, and may be frame-shifted as compared with the coding sequence. One skilled in the art will be able, using techniques available in the art and without undue experimentation, to test and select gene fragments for their ability to induce silencing when used in the present methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The DNA silencing episome described above may comprise multiple heterologous sequences (e.g., two, three, four, five, six or even more heterologous DNA sequences as described above) that are identical to or substantially similar to two or more endogenous plant genes (including gene fragments). According to this embodiment, the present invention may be used to silence two or more endogenous plant genes (e.g., two, three, four, five, six or even more endogenous plant genes). In preferred embodiments, two or more non-homologous endogenous plant genes are silenced (i.e., the genes are not part of a gene family). In other words, the present invention may be employed to suppress two unrelated genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in this embodiment, one of the nucleotide sequences may also effect silencing of more than one endogenous plant gene within a gene family. Likewise a single heterologous DNA sequence may silence more than one endogenous plant gene, typically homologous plant genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The two or more nucleotide sequences may be in the sense or antisense orientation, or a mixture thereof (i.e., some sequences in the sense and some sequences in the antisense orientation), and may further be frame-shifted as compared with the coding sequence. Each of the homologous sequences may be operably associated with a different promoter. Alternatively, two or more of the sequences, or even all of the sequences, will be operably associated with a single promoter (e.g., a geminivirus AR1, BR1 or BL1 promoter). As described hereinbelow, in particular embodiments, one or more of the nucleotide sequences is not operably associated with a promoter. Typically, however, an increased spread of gene silencing will be observed if the heterologous DNA sequence is operably associated with a promoter that drives transcription of the sequence (in either the sense or antisense direction). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Multiple gene silencing may be advantageously employed to alter the phenotype of a plant, as described in more detail hereinbelow. Silencing of multiple genes may be necessary to alter a single phenotypic trait; alternatively, multiple genes may be suppressed to modify more than one phenotypic trait in the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A preferred recombinant episomal silencing construct contains one or more heterologous DNA sequences, which may be any sequence having sequence identity to, or substantial sequence similarity to, an open reading frame of an endogenous gene encoding a polypeptide of interest (for example, an enzyme). Alternatively or in addition, the heterologous nucleotide sequence may be identical to or have substantial sequence similarity to an endogenous, genomic sequence, where the genomic sequence may be an open reading frame, an intron, a noncoding 5&prime; or 3&prime; sequence, or any other sequence which inhibits transcription, messenger RNA processing (for example, splicing), or translation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In one particular embodiment, the inventors have determined that DNA constructs, such as the geminivirus constructs described herein, are capable of silencing endogenous plant promoters, where the DNA construct introduced into the target plant carries DNA having sequence identity to (or substantial sequence similarity to) an endogenous promoter sequence. Thus, where a family of homologous genes exists, but the associated promoters differ, selective silencing of one member of the gene family may be achieved by suppressing its promoter, using episomal constructs of the present invention. Such promoters may be tissue-specific (e.g., promoters associated with leaf-specific actins, as compared to actins expressed in other plant tissues) or developmentally regulated promoters. Examples of such promoters are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In other particular embodiments, the heterologous DNA sequence (s) has substantial sequence similarity to a gene (including a fragment thereof), encoding a non-translated RNA molecule. Exemplary non-translated RNA molecules include but are not limited to ribozymes, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and snRNA molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The heterologous DNA segment carried by the silencing construct may represent only a fragment of the endogenous gene to be silenced or, alternatively, the entire gene (which may only include coding regions or may further include non-coding regions, such as introns and 5&prime; and 3&prime; untranslated sequences). The present inventors have surprisingly shown that relatively small fragments of genes, in either the sense or antisense orientation, are sufficient to induce silencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> There are no particular lower or upper limits to the length of the heterologous DNA sequences carried by the silencing vector. The fragment may be significantly shorter than the entire gene. The present inventors have made the surprising discovery that relatively short sequences may be used to effect gene silencing. The nucleotide sequence(s) may be as short as about 150, 100, 75, 50, 40, 30, or even 20 nucleotides in length, or even shorter, as long as the nucleotide sequence(s) provides for a desired level of gene silencing. There is no particular upper limit to the length of the nucleotide sequence or combined length of multiple sequences, subject to the carrying capacity of the silencing vector. e.g., the heterologous DNA sequence(s) may be as long as 150, 250, 500, 800, 1000 or even 1500 nucleotides in length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> To illustrate, it is typical for bipartite geminiviruses that episomal movement will be restricted as the size increases significantly beyond 2.9 kb. Accordingly, for vectors constructed from bipartite geminiviruses, it is preferred that the size of the episome is less than about 3.5 kb, more preferably, less than about 3.2 kb, still more preferably, less than about 3.0 kb. Alternatively stated, it is preferred that the silencing vector is approximately the size of a wild-type geminivirus genomic component, e.g., approximately 2.5-2.6 kb for a bipartite genomic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In general, it is preferred that the silencing vector is approximately 80% to 120%, more preferably approximately 90% to 110%, still more preferably approximately 95% to 105% the size of the wild type monopartite or bipartite genomic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As still a further alternative, in the case of &ldquo;pop out&rdquo; vectors as described below, i.e., a larger construct (typically, a shuttle vector) from which the geminivirus silencing vector excises itself, it is preferred that the &ldquo;pop out&rdquo; geminivirus vector have a total size as described in the previous paragraph. The larger construct (e.g., a shuttle vector) that is initially inoculated into the plant, will typically be substantially larger than the wild-type geminivirus genomic component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Further, the size restrictions on the heterologous nucleotide sequence(s) may depend on the site of insertion or replacement within the geminivirus genome. For example, typically about 800 nucleotides of the geminivirus coat protein may be replaced by heterologous DNA. In contrast, heterologous DNA sequences inserted or replaced within the B component, in particular the 3&prime; non-coding sequences following the stop codon of the BR1 or BL1 gene, are preferably less than about 300 nucleotides in length, more preferably less than about 250 nucleotides in length, still more preferably less than about 200 nucleotides in length, and yet more preferably less than about 150 nucleotides in length. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain sequences may be deleted from the B component (e.g., in the intergenic region) to increase the capacity for foreign sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The heterologous DNA sequences of this invention may be synthetic, naturally-derived, or combinations thereof. Methods of producing recombinant DNA constructs are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> In particular embodiments, the DNA silencing episomes of the present invention need not have a promoter operably linked to the heterologous DNA segment therein. Use of a silencing construct carrying a heterologous DNA segment as described above, where that DNA segment is not operably linked to a promoter in the DNA construct, may still result in silencing of an endogenous plant gene(s), and may further result in systemic silencing. Use of a promoter operably linked to the heterologous DNA in the silencing construct, however, is preferred and may increase the extent of the systemic silencing. Any promoter known in the art may be used, with plant promoters being preferred. Typically, however, the heterologous DNA segment is operatively associated with a native viral promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The heterologous DNA sequence may further be associated with other transcriptional control sequences, as are known, in the art (e.g., enhancer sequences, transcriptional termination sequences, and the like). According to the present invention, it is not necessary that the heterologous DNA sequences be transcribed or translated, however, they may be (e.g., if inserted into a viral gene). Moreover, it appears that the spread of gene silencing is increased if the heterologous DNA sequence is transcribed by the plant host cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In preferred embodiments, the present invention utilizes DNA episomes based on plant viral genomes. A particularly preferred embodiment utilizes episomes based on geminivirus genomes. Additional plant DNA viruses include the Caulimoviruses, the Badnaviruses, and the Nanoviruses, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Novel recombinant geminivirus constructs including silencing vectors, expression vectors (e.g., to express an antisense sequence or relatively small peptide from the B genomic component), and transfer vectors (e.g., shuttle vectors) are provided. The present geminivirus constructs, when transfected into a plant cell, act to silence a gene already present in the plant cell. The gene to be silenced may be an endogenous plant gene, or a gene or DNA sequence that has previously been artificially introduced into the plant cell. The present geminivirus constructs further provide a method for the systemic silencing of a gene in a plant, for example, by providing both the A and B genome components of the geminivirus to the subject plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides &ldquo;binary&rdquo; silencing vectors that comprise regions from both the A and B genomic components of a bipartite geminivirus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Where systemic silencing is desired, the construct is preferably capable of both replication in the host cell, and cell-to-cell movement (either of the DNA construct or a silencing factor). In the case of a bipartite geminivirus, this may be accomplished by using a binary vector, by co-introducing the A and B components, or by stably transforming the host plant to express the replication or movement proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, the silencing vector comprises a geminivirus genomic component comprising one or more heterologous DNA sequences (as described above), where each of the heterologous DNA sequences has substantial sequence similarity to an endogenous plant gene(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In one particular preferred embodiment, the geminivirus genomic component is a geminivirus A genomic component. Heterologous DNA may replace any coding or non-coding region that is nonessential for the present purposes of gene silencing, or may be inserted just downstream of an endogenous viral gene, e.g., such that the viral gene and heterologous DNA are cotranscribed. In particular preferred embodiments, one or more heterologous nucleotide sequences may be inserted into or replace (preferably, replace) a segment of the sequence encoding the geminivirus coat protein (i.e., AR1 gene) or the common region. With respect to the common region, it is preferred that the heterologous DNA sequences are not inserted into or replace the Ori sequences or the flanking sequences that are required for viral DNA replication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In other particular preferred embodiments, the vector further comprises geminivirus genes encoding the movement proteins (e.g, BR1 and/or BL1 genes). In alternative embodiments, both the geminivirus A and B components are carried by a single construct. The heterologous DNA sequence(s) may be inserted into or replace sequences within the B component as described below. For example, one or more heterologous DNA sequences may be inserted into the coding or 3&prime; non-coding regions of the BR1 and/or BL1 genes, the B component intergenic region, or the common region, as described further hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that the geminivirus constructs of the invention may be &ldquo;hybrids&rdquo; or &ldquo;pseudorecombinants&rdquo;, i.e., include sequences from two or more different geminiviruses or genomic components from different geminiviruses, respectively (see, e.g., Hill et al., (1998) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>250:283; Sung et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>J. Gen. Virol. </italic></highlight>76:2809). Likewise, in the methods of the present invention, plants may be inoculated with genomic components (i e., A and B) from different geminiviruses, or with constructs carrying genes from different geminiviruses, as long as suitable levels of silencing according to the invention are achieved. In general, geminivirusesin which the A and B genomic components are from the same geminivirus are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In other preferred embodiments, the silencing vector comprises a geminivirus B component. Heterologous DNA may replace any coding or non-coding region that is nonessential for the present purposes of gene silencing, or may be inserted downstream of an endogenous viral gene such that the viral gene and heterologous DNA are cotranscribed. In particular embodiments, the heterologous DNA sequences may be inserted into or replace a segment of the 3&prime; non-coding sequences following the stop codon of the BR1 and/or BL1 genes, i.e., the sequence is 3&prime; of the stop codon and 5&prime; of the poly-A sequence so that the sequence is co-transcribed with the BR1 or BL1 gene, but is not translated. Alternatively, the heterologous DNA sequence(s) are inserted into or replace a portion of the coding region of the BR1 and/or BL1 genes, although systemic silencing may be reduced. As a further alternative, the heterologous DNA sequence(s) may be inserted into or replace a segment of the intergenic region between the BR1 and BL1 genes. As described above with respect to the A component, the heterologous DNA sequence(s) may be inserted into the common region of the B component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In particular embodiments, the silencing construct further comprises the geminivirus genes encoding the replication proteins, e.g., the AL1, AL3 and/or AL2 genes. Constructs encoding the AL1 and/or AL3 genes are preferred. As described above, the silencing vector may be a binary construct comprising both a geminivirus A component and geminivirus B component. The heterologous DNA sequence(s) may be inserted into or replace sequences within the A component as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> An alternative preferred DNA silencing construct comprises an origin of replication from a plant DNA virus, preferably from a plant DNA virus such as a geminivirus. The construct further preferably includes DNA encoding any proteins necessary for replication of the DNA construct in a plant cell. In one particular embodiment, the silencing vector comprises geminivirus AL1, AL2, and AL3 genes, preferably, the AL1 or AL3 genes, more preferably, both the AL1 and AL3 genes. Additionally, or alternatively, the silencing vector may comprise the geminivirus AR1 gene. The origin of replication and DNA encoding necessary replication proteins may be obtained from the same geminivirus species; alternatively, the origin of replication may be from one geminivirus species and the replication proteins from a different geminivirus species. The construct further includes one or more heterologous DNA segments identical to, or having substantial sequence similarity to, an endogenous plant gene(s) to be silenced (or fragments thereof, as described above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the silencing vector further comprises a geminivirus BR1 and/or BL1 gene, preferably both. The construct may further include the intergenic region from the B component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> One or more heterologous nucleotide sequences may be inserted into or replace segments of the coding and non-coding regions of the geminivirus A and B genomic components, as described above. Alternatively, a heterologous DNA sequence(s) may be inserted into the vector outside of the viral sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> An alternative preferred DNA silencing construct comprises an origin of replication from a plant DNA virus, preferably from a plant DNA virus such as a geminivirus. The construct further preferably includes DNA sequences encoding proteins required for viral movement, preferably, geminivirus sequences, more preferably, the geminivirus BR1 and/or BL1 genes. The origin of replication and DNA encoding the movement proteins may be obtained from the same geminivirus species; alternatively, the origin of replication may be from one geminivirus species and the replication proteins from a different geminivirus species. The construct further includes one or more heterologous DNA segments identical to, or having substantial sequence similarity to, an endogenous plant gene(s) to be silenced (or fragments thereof, as described above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> According to this embodiment, it is further preferred that the construct encode sequences required for replication of the construct in a plant cell. Preferably, the replication sequences are from a geminivirus, e.g., the geminivirus AL1, AL2, and AL3 sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the total size of the silencing vector is approximately the size of a wild-type geminivirus genomic component, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides shuttle vectors which acts as a transfer vehicle for the silencing vector. The shuttle vector will typically replicate in a non-plant cell, e.g., a bacterial, yeast, or animal (e.g., insect, avian or mammalian) cell. Preferably, the shuttle vector replicates in bacterial cells. More preferably, the shuttle vector is a plasmid that replicates in bacterial cells (e.g, derived from pUC or an Agrobacterium Ri or Ti plasmid). In one particular embodiment of the invention, the geminivirus silencing vector is delivered in a shuttle plasmid, from which the geminivirus sequences excise themselves upon introduction into the plant cell. The shuttle vector may be introduced into the plant cell by any method known in the art, e.g., inoculation with Agrobacterium (as described below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> In some instances, introduction of the geminivirus silencing construct into the plant may cause pathology (e.g., disease, loss of viability, and the like) in the plant. Accordingly, it is preferred that the silencing vectors described herein comprise geminivirus genomic components (or alternatively, geminivirus sequences) that are attenuated (e.g., contain one or attenuating mutations). Methods of selecting attenuated virus strains are known in the art. Alternatively, attenuated strains may be routinely generated using standard methods of mutagenesis or genetic engineering techniques (such as site-directed mutagenesis). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Methods of Using the Virus Constructs of the Invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The present methods are useful in suppressing the production of any undesired gene product, e.g., sugars or other products contributing to the flavor, color or composition of a plant product. In addition, gene suppression may be used to vary the fatty acid distribution in plants such as rapeseed, Cuphea or jojoba, to delay the ripening of fruits and vegetables, to change the organoleptic, storage, packaging, picking, and/or processing properties of fruits and vegetables, to delay the flowering or senescing of cut flowers for bouquets, or to alter flower or fruit color. Exemplary genes that may be silenced include, but are not limited to, black phenol oxidase (browning in fruit), M-methylputrescine oxidase or putrescine N-methyl transferase (to reduce nicotine, e.g., in tobacco), polygalactouronase or cellulase (to delay ripening in fruits, e.g., tomatoes), ACC oxidase (to decrease ethylene production), 7-methylxanthine 3-methyl transferase (to reduce caffeine, e.g., in coffee, or to reduce theophylline, e.g., in tea), chalcone synthase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, or dehydrokaempferol hydroxylases (to alter flower color, e.g, in ornamental flowers), cinnamoyl-CoA:NADPH reductase or cinnamoyl alcohol dehydrogenase (to reduce lignin content, e.g., in pine, fir and spruce), GL1 (to block trichome development to produce &ldquo;hairless&rdquo; leaves or fruit, e.g, peaches), cellulose (to decrease &ldquo;woody&rdquo; tissue, e.g, in asparagus), 1,3-1,4-glucan in barley (to reduce &ldquo;cloudy&rdquo; beer), Prup1 (a peach and apricot allergen), and other plant allergens (e.g, peanut and other nut allergens), the gene encoding the toxic lectin protein or alkaloid ricinine in castor beans, genes required for seed or pit production in fruit, and the like. In addition, systemic or tissue-specific suppression of a particular endogenous protein product may be desirable where the plant has been transformed to express a protein product of interest; suppression of endogenous proteins may lead to increased production of the transgene of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Although the vectors of the present invention are typically not transmitted &equals;through the germ-line, the present inventors have observed that the silencing effects produced according to the present invention may persist at least through several generations in cultured cells. Accordingly, the present invention may be used to produce long-term suppression without stable integration into the plant genome and without germ-line transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The present invention may further be advantageously used to suppress genes in plants that reproduce via asexual reproduction (e.g, potatoes, cassava, poinsettias, bananas, grapevines, fruit trees, and the like). Methods of asexual reproduction are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, reproduction by grafting, cuttings, stolons, rhizomes, splitting of plants and bulbs, and apomixis. The present invention is particularly advantageous in plants that are asexually reproduced by grafting. Roses, bananas and plantains, grapes, and fruit trees (e.g., apple, orange, pear, peach, nectarine, plum, cherry, apricot and the like) are illustrative examples of plants that may be reproduced by grafting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The host plant need not be one that is naturally susceptible to the virus from which the silencing construct is derived. Particle bombardment techniques, as described below, may be used to introduce a silencing construct into a cell, or group of cells, in a plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Improved methods of isolating and sequencing gene sequences have provided many isolated plant DNA segments of unknown function. Methods of determining the function of DNA segments have not kept pace with methods of isolating or determining the sequence of DNA segments. The present constructs and methods provide a means of rapidly and reproducibly screening plant DNA sequences of unknown function to determine their function in plant cells, tissue or intact plants, using episomally-mediated homology-dependent gene silencing. Such screening methods typically include the preparation of an episomal silencing construct containing one or more heterologous DNA sequences identical to or having substantial sequence similarity to an endogenous plant gene(s) (as described above); inoculating host plants or host plant tissue or cells with the silencing construct and, after a period of growth, comparing the inoculated host with an uninfected control plant or control plant tissue or cells. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the &ldquo;test&rdquo; plant and &ldquo;control&rdquo; plant may be the same. For example, the same plant may be compared before and after inoculation. Alternatively, and preferably, different parts of the same plant (e.g., different leaves) may be used for the &ldquo;test&rdquo; and &ldquo;control&rdquo; treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> It is not necessary that the sequence of the target sequence or the sequence of the heterologous DNA carried by the episomal silencing construct be known. For example, nucleotide sequences from a library (e.g., a random library or a plant cDNA library, or any other library of nucleotide sequences of interest) may be cloned into the episomal silencing vector and introduced into a plant as described herein. Plants exhibiting phenotypic characteristics of interest may be identified, the sequence of the library clone(s) of interest determined, and the corresponding plant target gene(s) identified by standard techniques. Such &ldquo;functional genomic&rdquo; approaches may be employed to rapidly identify gene functions of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Constructs based on geminivirus, nanovirus, badnavirus and caulimovirus genomes are particularly useful, as these viruses are known to infect a wide variety of agriculturally important crop plants. Characteristics for comparing test and control plants include growth characteristics, morphology, observable phenotype (including phenotypes observable with microscopic techniques), and biochemical composition. The differences between the test and control plants indicate the function of the silenced DNA sequence. The period of growth necessary for any differences in the treated and control plants to become apparent will vary depending on the host plants used and the function of the DNA being suppressed, as will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Such periods may range from several days, a week, two weeks, three weeks or four weeks, up to six weeks, eight weeks, three months, six months or more. Because the present method does not require tissue culture or selection to obtain alterations in gene expression, the methods can be adapted to automation for large-scale screening of anonymous sequences for function in plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;screening&rdquo; of a DNA segment does not imply that the function of the DNA segment will be positively identified in every case. As used herein, an &ldquo;unidentified&rdquo; plant gene or DNA segment is one whose functional role in the plant is unknown, even though the nucleotide sequence may be known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> As used herein a method of screening or identifying the &ldquo;function&rdquo; of an endogenous plant gene is not intended to indicate that the function or action of the gene (and the associated gene product) is necessarily identified at the cellular or molecular level. The term &ldquo;function,&rdquo; as used herein, also refers to a phenotypic feature of the plant (or plant cell or plant tissue) that is associated with silencing of the endogenous plant gene, which phenotypic feature provides information related to the function or biological activity of the plant gene and its gene product. For example, the present invention may be used to silence plant genes which result in a stunting of growth, loss of chlorophyll, reduced stress tolerance, and the like. These plant genes would be presumptively identified as having functions related to normal growth, chlorophyll production, stress tolerance, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides methods for rapidly and reproducibly screening portions of an isolated plant gene of known function, to identify those portions or fragments of genes that are effective in preventing or suppressing expression. Such screening methods will lead to refinements in current methods of gene suppression using sense and antisense DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> According to the present methods, the plant (or plant cell or tissue) may be co-inoculated with both the geminivirus A and B genomic components, alternatively, both genomic components may be present on a single binary vector. For example, as described hereinbelow, the plant may be co-inoculated with a geminivirus silencing vector comprising a geminivirus A component and an additional construct comprising a geminivirus B component that provides the movement proteins for the silencing vector (and which may further be a silencing vector as well). Conversely, the plant may be co-inoculated with a geminivirus silencing vector comprising a geminivirus B component and a construct comprising a geminivirus A component that provides replication functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> As still a further alternative, the plant may be co-inoculated with vectors comprising the geminivirus replication and movement proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, in particular embodiments, the test cell or plant may be stably transformed to express particular geminivirus genes and then inoculated with a geminivirus silencing vector, as described above, comprising a heterologous DNA sequence(s), where the sequence(s) has substantial homology to an endogenous plant gene or a fragment thereof. For example, the plant cell or plant may be stably transformed with a geminivirus A component (alternatively, geminivirus AL1, AL2, and/or AL3 genes), and is then inoculated with a silencing vector comprising a geminivirus B genomic component (alternatively, the geminivirus BR1 and/or BL1 genes). In this manner, the stably incorporated replication genes from the A component will support the replication of the silencing vector comprising the B component (or B component genes). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Conversely, the plant cell or plant may be stably transformed with a geminivirus B component (alternatively, the BR1 and/or BL1 genes), and is inoculated with a silencing vector comprising a geminivirus A component (alternatively, geminivirus AL1, AL2, and/or AL3 genes to provide replication functions). According to this embodiment, the B component movement proteins expressed from the plant genome will enhance movement of the silencing vector comprising the A component (or A component genes). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> As described above, the silencing vector may be phloem-limited or non-phloem limited. In particular embodiments, a phloem-limited silencing virus (e.g., a geminivirus phloem-limited silencing vector) is preferred. The inventors have made the surprising discovery that gene silencing in cells outside of the phloem may be achieved with phloem-limited vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> In other preferred embodiments, silencing is observed in plant cells outside of the phloem, e.g., in mesophyll cells, epidermis cells, cortical cells, parenchymal cells, guard cells, xylem cells, floral cells, fruit cells, seed coat cells, meristematic cells, apical cells, sclerenchyma cells, and/or colenchyma cells. Silencing is not typically observed in the embryo or other cells within the seed (other than seed coat cells). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In particular embodiments, the invention further finds use in methods of screening two or more endogenous plant genes for function, as described more fully hereinbelow. In addition, this embodiment may be employed to explore complex metabolic pathways, which because of compensatory interactions or multiple (e.g., redundant) branches necessitates silencing of more than one gene to disrupt the pathway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The ease and convenience of the present invention further advantageously allows multiple genes to be silenced to carry out genetic studies similar to those used in other model systems, such as yeast. For example, multiple genes may be suppressed for studies of &ldquo;synthetic enhancement&rdquo;, &ldquo;synthetic lethality&rdquo; or &ldquo;epistatic&rdquo; studies. In general, &ldquo;synthetic lethality&rdquo; and &ldquo;synthetic enhancement&rdquo; studies permit the identification of combinations of two or more genes, which when co-suppressed, enhance the severity of the phenotype more than when any one of the genes is suppressed. &ldquo;Epistatic&rdquo; studies may be used to define biochemical pathways, by identifying genes that give qualitatively similar phenotypes upon suppression (e.g., the genes are in the same epistatic group). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In a still further preferred embodiment of multiple gene silencing, one or more of the silenced genes is a transgene introduced into the plant encoding a reporter protein (e.g., GFP, luciferase, &bgr;-glucuronidase, &bgr;-galactosidase) or any other endogenous plant marker protein that will give rise to a readily observable phenotype upon silencing (e.g., the su gene or other genes required for synthesis of chlorophyll or other plant pigments). Silencing of the reporter or marker gene is a convenient indicator to assess the presence, extent and/or spread of silencing of other genes by the silencing vector. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the silencing of different genes by the nucleotide sequences carried by the silencing vectors of the present invention may not be completely co-extensive. The suitability of any particular reporter or marker gene as an indicator of suppression of any other plant gene may be readily determined by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The present invention advantageously provides methods of silencing one or more endogenous plant genes using silencing vectors which are preferably derived from DNA plant viruses, more preferably geminiviruses, as described above. The silencing vector may be derived from a geminivirus A component or B component, or both. In particular embodiments, a plant (or plant cell or tissue) is inoculated with one or more silencing vectors derived from a geminivirus A component and one or more silencing vectors derived from a geminivirus B component. For example, in an illustrative preferred embodiment, a plant is inoculated with a silencing vector comprising a geminivirus A component and another silencing vector comprising a geminivirus B component. The geminivirus genomic components may be from the same geminivirus or may be &ldquo;pseudorecombinants&rdquo; as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In a further preferred embodiment, silencing vectors comprising the squash leaf curl virus genomic A or B components are used to achieve gene silencing in Arabidopsis, canola or other species of Brassicaceae (as described below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In still a further preferred embodiment, silencing vectors comprising the bean golden mosaic virus genomic A and/or B component is used to achieve gene silencing in soybeans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, silencing vectors comprising the cotton leaf curl virus genomic A and/or B component is used to achieve gene silencing in cotton. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The present DNA episomal silencing system provides advantages over RNA viral vectors that are currently in use for testing gene function. Infection with RNA viruses requires that infectious transcripts be made in vitro, capped, and mechanically inoculated. Other &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; systems in plants rely on chromosomal transformation, which can be time-consuming. Unlike RNA virus-derived vectors, foreign DNA is stably maintained in geminivirus vectors and cloned DNA isolated from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>can be used directly for inoculation of intact plants, e.g., by particle bombardment. Infectious DNAs can be easily generated from shuttle vector libraries containing large segments of cDNA sequence. The present inventors have shown that as little as about 50 base pairs of transcribed sequence can result in effective silencing, obviating the need for cloning full-length cDNAs. Promoter sequences have also been silenced by TGMV vectors, indicating that individual members of gene families can be selectively silenced where their promoters differ sufficiently from one another. Geminivirus and badnavirus vectors can be developed for different families of plants, thus allowing genes to be characterized directly in a species of interest. The present invention can also be used to identify single gene traits in a variety of species. Libraries of genes can be tested by subjecting plants to a screen for a single gene trait, such as pathogen resistance, and then looking for susceptible plants whose gene for resistance has been silenced. Current mutagenesis techniques require screening of segregating progeny, which can be time-consuming and is not feasible for many species that carry genes of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a method of silencing genes in intact plants, plant cells, and plant tissues using a mobile silencing vector, without the need to regenerate entire plants from individual cells. Silencing of active plant genes may be achieved with homologous fragments carried by a silencing vector in either the sense or anti-sense direction. Silencing may be achieved with small gene fragments (e.g., approximately 50 nucleotides or less), and may be achieved in the absence of detectable transcription or translation of the homologous sequence carried by the silencing vector. Moreover, the present inventors have observed gene silencing in cells with the inventive geminivirus silencing vectors in the absence of viral replication within the cell. While not wishing to be held to a single theory of the invention, it appears that the silencing signal is diffusible in nature and may extend well beyond the cells in which the geminivirus replicates. For example, when TGMV vectors were inoculated by bombardment into plants, areas of hundreds of cells were silenced within 3-5 days, whereas the virus only replicated in 1-2 cells (Kjemtrup et al., (1998) <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>14:91). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> CbLCV Silencing Vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In particular preferred embodiments of the invention, the silencing vector is derived from the Cabbage Leaf Curl Virus (CbLCV). CbLCV silencing vectors may be used with any suitable plant (or plant cell or tissue), preferably a species of Brassicaceae (as set forth in more detail below), more preferably Arabidopsis. In other preferred embodiments, the plant is a tobacco plant. Moreover, the inventive CbLCV vectors may be used in the silencing and screening methods set forth herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have made the discovery, that unlike most geminiviruses, CbLCV is non-phloem limited. Silencing may be achieved with CbLCV silencing vectors in cells outside of the phloem, e.g., in mesophyll cells, epidermis cells, cortical cells, parenchymal cells, guard cells, xylem cells, floral cells, fruit cells, meristematic cells, seed coat cells, apical cells, sclerenchyma cells, and colenchyma cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> CbLCV silencing vectors are as described above with respect to geminivirus silencing vectors. In one preferred embodiment, the silencing vector comprises a CbLCV genomic component, which comprises one or more heterologous DNA sequences, each of the heterologous DNA sequences having substantial sequence similarity to an endogenous plant gene or a fragment thereof. The CbLCV genomic component may be the A component or the B component. As a further alternative, the silencing vector may be a binary vector that comprises sequences from both the CbLCV A component and the B component. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the CbLCV silencing vectors may comprise &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; or &ldquo;pseudorecombinant&rdquo; geminivirus sequences, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In other preferred embodiments, the CbLCV genomic component is attenuated, so that pathological effects in the plant (or plant cell or tissue) inoculated with the CbLCV silencing vector are reduced as compared with the effects observed with a wild-type or non-attenuated CbLCV silencing vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In other preferred embodiments, the silencing vector comprises a CbLCV origin of replication, CbLCV genes necessary for replication of the vector in a plant cell (e.g., AL1, AL3 and/or AL2 genes, preferably AL1 and AL3), and one or more heterologous DNA sequences, each of the heterologous DNA sequences having substantial sequence similarity to an endogenous plant gene or a fragment thereof. The silencing vector may further comprise geminivirus (preferably CbLCV) sequences required for movement (e.g., BR1 and/or BL1 genes). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In a still further preferred embodiment, the silencing vector comprises a CbLCV origin or replication, the CbLCV movement sequences (e.g., BR1 and/or BL1 genes, preferably both), and one or more heterologous DNA sequences, each of the heterologous DNA sequences having substantial sequence similarity to an endogenous plant gene or a fragment thereof. The silencing vector may further comprise geminivirus (preferably CbLCV) sequences required for replication (e.g., AL1, AL2 and/or AL3 genes). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In particular preferred embodiments, the CbLCV genomic component is pseudorecombinant between CbLCV and squash leaf curl virus (see, e.g., Hill et al., (1998) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>250:283). Such pseudorecombinants may have reduced pathological effects on host plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Subject Plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Plants that may be employed in practicing the present invention include any plant (angiosperm or gymnosperm; monocot or dicot) in which DNA constructs according to the present invention can replicate and, where systemic silencing is desired, where movement of the DNA construct or a silencing factor occurs. Particularly preferred are those plants susceptible to infection by plant geminiviruses. As used herein, &ldquo;susceptible to infection&rdquo; includes plants that are naturally infected by geminiviruses in the wild, plants that can be mechanically inoculated with the DNA construct, or that can be inoculated by methods other than mechanical inoculation (such as by Agrobacterium inoculation). &ldquo;Susceptible to infection&rdquo; refers to plants in which the DNA construct is able to replicate within the inoculated plant cell. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Also included are plants that serve primarily as laboratory models, e.g., Arabidopsis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Preferred plants for use in the present methods include (but are not limited to) <highlight><italic>legumes, solanaceous </italic></highlight>species (e.g., tomatoes), leafy vegetables such as lettuce and cabbage, turfgrasses, and crop plants (e.g., tobacco, wheat, sorghum, barley, rye, rice, corn, cotton, cassava, and the like), and laboratory plants (e.g., Arabidopsis). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Transformation Methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Plants can be transformed according to the present invention using any suitable method known in the art. Intact plants, plant tissue, explants, meristematic tissue, protoplasts, callus tissue, cultured cells, and the like may be used for transformation depending on the plant species and the method employed. In a preferred embodiment, intact plants are inoculated using microprojectiles carrying a geminivirus silencing vector according to the present invention. The site of inoculation will be apparent to one skilled in the art; leaf tissue is one example of a suitable site of inoculation. In preferred embodiments, intact plant tissues or plants are inoculated, without the need for regeneration of plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Exemplary transformation methods include biological methods using viruses and Agrobacterium, physicochemical methods such as electroporation, polyethylene glycol, ballistic bombardment, microinjection, and the like. Transformation by ballistic bombardment is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In one form of direct transformation, the vector is microinjected directly into plant cells by use of micropipettes to mechanically transfer the recombinant DNA (Crossway, <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genetics </italic></highlight>202:, 179 (1985)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In another protocol, the genetic material is transferred into the plant cell using polyethylene glycol (Krens, et al. <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>296, 72 (1982)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In still another method, protoplasts are fused with minicells, cells, lysosomes, or other fusible lipid-surfaced bodies that contain the nucleotide sequence to be transferred to the plant (Fraley, et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>79, 1859 (1982)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> DNA may also be introduced into the plant cells by electroporation (Fromm et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>82, 5824 (1985)). In this technique, plant protoplasts are electroporated in the presence of plasmids containing the expression cassette. Electrical impulses of high field strength reversibly permeabilize biomembranes allowing the introduction of the plasmids. Electroporated plant protoplasts reform the cell wall, divide and regenerate. One advantage of electroporation is that large pieces of DNA, including artificial chromosomes, can be transformed by this method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Viruses include RNA and DNA viruses, with DNA viruses (e.g., geminiviruses, badnaviruses, nanoviruses and caulimoviruses) being preferred, and geminiviruses being more preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Ballistic transformation typically comprises the steps of: (a) providing a plant tissue as a target; (b) propelling a microprojectile carrying the heterologous nucleotide sequence at the plant tissue at a velocity sufficient to pierce the walls of the cells within the tissue and to deposit the nucleotide sequence within a cell of the tissue to thereby provide a transformed tissue. In particular preferred embodiments of the invention, the method further includes the step of culturing the transformed tissue with a selection agent. In a more preferred embodiment, the selection step is followed by the step of regenerating transformed plants from the transformed tissue. As noted below, the technique may be carried out with the nucleotide sequence as a precipitate (wet or freeze-dried) alone, in place of the aqueous solution containing the nucleotide sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Any ballistic cell transformation apparatus can be used in practicing the present invention. Exemplary apparatus are disclosed by Sandford et al. (<highlight><italic>Particulate Science and Technology </italic></highlight>5, 27 (1988)), Klein et al. (<highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>327, 70 (1987)), and in EP 0 270 356. Such apparatus have been used to transform maize cells (Klein et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85, 4305 (1988)), soybean callus (Christou et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol </italic></highlight>87, 671 (1988)), McCabe et al., <highlight><italic>BioTechnology </italic></highlight>6, 923 (1988), yeast mitochondria (Johnston et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>240, 1538 (1988)), and Chlamydomonas chloroplasts (Boynton et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>240, 1534 (1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Alternately, an apparatus configured as described by Klein et al. (<highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>70, 327 (1987)) may be utilized. This apparatus comprises a bombardment chamber, which is divided into two separate compartments by an adjustable-height stopping plate. An acceleration tube is mounted on top of the bombardment chamber. A macroprojectile is propelled down the acceleration tube at the stopping plate by a gunpowder charge. The stopping plate has a borehole formed therein, which is smaller in diameter than the microprojectile. The macroprojectile carries the microprojectile(s), and the macroprojectile is aimed and fired at the borehole. When the macroprojectile is stopped by the stopping plate, the microprojectile(s) is propelled through the borehole. The target tissue is positioned in the bombardment chamber so that a microprojectile(s) propelled through the bore hole penetrates the cell walls of the cells in the target tissue and deposit the nucleotide sequence of interest carried thereon in the cells of the target tissue. The bombardment chamber is partially evacuated prior to use to prevent atmospheric drag from unduly slowing the microprojectiles. The chamber is only partially evacuated so that the target tissue is not desiccated during bombardment. A vacuum of between about 400 to about 800 millimeters of mercury is suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In alternate embodiments, ballistic transformation is achieved without use of microprojectiles. For example, an aqueous solution containing the nucleotide sequence of interest as a precipitate may be carried by the macroprojectile (e.g., by placing the aqueous solution directly on the plate-contact end of the macroprojectile without a microprojectile, where it is held by surface tension), and the solution alone propelled at the plant tissue target (e.g., by propelling the macroprojectile down the acceleration tube in the same manner as described above). Other approaches include placing the nucleic acid precipitate itself (&ldquo;wet&rdquo; precipitate) or a freeze-dried nucleotide precipitate directly on the plate-contact end of the macroprojectile without a microprojectile. In the absence of a microprojectile, it is believed that the nucleotide sequence must either be propelled at the tissue target at a greater velocity than that needed if carried by a microprojectile, or the nucleotide sequenced caused to travel a shorter distance to the target tissue (or both). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> It is currently preferred to carry the nucleotide sequence on a microprojectile. The microprojectile may be formed from any material having sufficient density and cohesiveness to be propelled through the cell wall, given the particle&apos;s velocity and the distance the particle must travel. Non-limiting examples of materials for making microprojectiles include metal, glass, silica, ice, polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, and carbon compounds (e.g., graphite, diamond). Metallic particles are currently preferred. Non-limiting examples of suitable metals include tungsten, gold, and iridium. The particles should be of a size sufficiently small to avoid excessive disruption of the cells they contact in the target tissue, and sufficiently large to provide the inertia required to penetrate to the cell of interest in the target tissue. Particles ranging in diameter from about one-half micrometer to about three micrometers are suitable. Particles need not be spherical, as surface irregularities on the particles may enhance their DNA carrying capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The nucleotide sequence may be immobilized on the particle by precipitation. The precise precipitation parameters employed will vary depending upon factors such as the particle acceleration procedure employed, as is known in the art. The carrier particles may optionally be coated with an encapsulating agents such as polylysine to improve the stability of nucleotide sequences immobilized thereon, as discussed in EP 0 270 356 (column 8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, plants may be transformed using <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic></highlight>or <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic></highlight>, preferably <highlight><italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic></highlight>. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer exploits the natural ability of <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>A. rhizogenes </italic></highlight>to transfer DNA into plant chromosomes. Agrobacterium is a plant pathogen that transfers a set of genes encoded in a region called T-DNA of the Ti and Ri plasmids of <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>A. rhizogenes</italic></highlight>, respectively, into plant cells. The typical result of transfer of the Ti plasmid is a tumorous growth called a crown gall in which the T-DNA is stably integrated into a host chromosome. Integration of the Ri plasmid into the host chromosomal DNA results in a condition known as &ldquo;hairy root disease&rdquo;. The ability to cause disease in the host plant can be removed by deletion of the genes in the T-DNA without loss of DNA transfer and integration. The DNA to be transferred is attached to border sequences that define the end points of an integrated T-DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Gene transfer by means of engineered Agrobacterium strains has become routine for many dicotyledonous plants. Some difficulty has been experienced, however, in using Agrobacterium to transform monocotyledonous plants, in particular, cereal plants. However, Agrobacterium mediated transformation has been achieved in several monocot species, including cereal species such as rye (de la Pena et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>325, 274 (1987)), maize (Rhodes et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>240, 204 (1988)), and rice (Shimamoto et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>338, 274 (1989)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> While the following discussion will focus on using <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>to achieve gene transfer in plants, those skilled in the art will appreciate that this discussion also applies to <highlight><italic>A. rhizogenes</italic></highlight>. Transformation using <highlight><italic>A. rhizogenes </italic></highlight>has developed analogously to that of <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>and has been successfully utilized to transform, for example, alfalfa, <highlight><italic>Solanum nigrum </italic></highlight>L., and poplar. U.S. Pat. No. 5,777,200 to Ryals et al. As described by U.S. Pat. No. 5, 773,693 to Burgess et al., it is preferable to use a disarmed <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>strain (as described below), however, the wild-type <highlight><italic>A. rhizogenes </italic></highlight>may be employed. An illustrative strain of <highlight><italic>A. rhizogenes </italic></highlight>is strain 15834. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The Agrobacterium strain utilized in the methods of the present invention is modified to contain the nucleotide sequences to be transferred to the plant. The nucleotide sequence to be transferred is incorporated into the T-region and is typically flanked by at least one T-DNA border sequence, preferably two T-DNA border sequences. A variety of Agrobacterium strains are known in the art particularly, and can be used in the methods of the invention. See, e.g., Hooykaas, <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>13, 327 (1989); Smith et al., <highlight><italic>Crop Science </italic></highlight>35, 301 (1995); Chilton, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90, 3119 (1993); Mollony et al., <highlight><italic>Monograph Theor. Appl. Genet NY </italic></highlight>19, 148 (1993); Ishida et al., <highlight><italic>Nature Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>14, 745 (1996); and Komari et al., <highlight><italic>The Plant Journal </italic></highlight>10, 165 (1996), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In addition to the T-region, the Ti (or Ri) plasmid contains a vir region. The vir region is important for efficient transformation, and appears to be species-specific. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Two exemplary classes of recombinant Ti and Ri plasmid vector systems are commonly used in the art. In one class, called &ldquo;cointegrate,&rdquo; the shuttle vector containing the gene of interest is inserted by genetic recombination into a non-oncogenic Ti plasmid that contains both the cis-acting and trans-acting elements required for plant transformation as, for example, in the PMLJ1 shuttle vector of DeBlock et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J </italic></highlight>3, 1681 (1984), and the non-oncogenic Ti plasmid pGV2850 described by Zambryski et al., <highlight><italic>EMBOJ </italic></highlight>2, 2143 (1983). In the second class or &ldquo;binary&rdquo; system, the gene of interest is inserted into a shuttle vector containing the cis-acting elements required for plant transformation. The other necessary functions are provided in trans by the non-oncogenic Ti plasmid as exemplified by the pBIN19 shuttle vector described by Bevan, <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Research </italic></highlight>12, 8711 (1984), and the non-oncogenic Ti plasmid PAL4404 described by Hoekma, et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>303, 179 (1983). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Binary vector systems have been developed where the manipulated disarmed T-DNA carrying the heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest and the vir functions are present on separate plasmids. In this manner, a modified T-DNA region comprising foreign DNA (the nucleic acid to be transferred) is constructed in a small plasmid that replicates in <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>. This plasmid is transferred conjugatively in a tri-parental mating or via electroporation into A. tumefaciens that contains a compatible plasmid with virulence gene sequences. The vir functions are supplied in trans to transfer the T-DNA into the plant genome. Such binary vectors are useful in the practice of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> In particular embodiments of the invention, super-binary vectors are employed. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,615 and EP 0 604 662, herein incorporated by reference. Such a super-binary vector has been constructed containing a DNA region originating from the hypervirulence region of the Ti plasmid pTiBo542 (Jin et al., <highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>169, 4417 (1987)) contained in a super-virulent <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens </italic></highlight>A281 exhibiting extremely high transformation efficiency (Hood et al., <highlight><italic>Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>2, 702 (1984); Hood et al., <highlight><italic>J.

No. 5,591,616, herein incorporated by reference) and pTOK233 (Komari, <highlight><italic>Plant Cell Reports </italic></highlight>9, 303 (1990); Ishida et al., <highlight><italic>Nature Biotechnology </italic></highlight>14, 745 (1996); herein incorporated by reference). Other super-binary vectors may be constructed by the methods set forth in the above references. Super-binary vector pTOK162 is capable of replication in both <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and in <highlight><italic>A. tumefaciens</italic></highlight>. Additionally, the vector contains the virB, virC and virG genes from the virulence region of pTiBo542. The plasmid also contains an antibiotic resistance gene, a selectable marker gene, and the nucleic acid of interest to be transformed into the plant. The nucleic acid to be inserted into the plant genome is typically located between the two border sequences of the T region. Super-binary vectors of the invention can be constructed having the features described above for pTOK162. The T-region of the super-binary vectors and other vectors for use in the invention are constructed to have restriction sites for the insertion of the genes to be delivered. Alternatively, the DNA to be transformed can be inserted in the T-DNA region of the vector by utilizing in vivo homologous recombination. See, Herrera-Esterella et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>2, 987 (1983); Horch et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>223, 496 (1984). Such homologous recombination relies on the fact that the super-binary vector has a region homologous with a region of pBR322 or other similar plasmids. Thus, when the two plasmids are brought together, a desired gene is inserted into the super-binary vector by genetic recombination via the homologous regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Plant cells may be transformed with Agrobacteria by any means known in the art, e.g., by co-cultivation with cultured isolated protoplasts, or transformation of intact cells or tissues. The first requires an established culture system that allows for culturing protoplasts and subsequent plant regeneration from cultured protoplasts. Identification of transformed cells or plants is generally accomplished by including a selectable marker in the transforming vector, or by obtaining evidence of successful bacterial infection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In plants stably transformed by Agrobacteria-mediated transformation, the nucleotide sequence of interest is incorporated into the plant genome, typically flanked by at least one T-DNA border sequence. Preferably, the nucleotide sequence of interest is flanked by two T-DNA border sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Plant cells, which have been transformed by any method known in the art, can also be regenerated to produce intact plants using known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Plant regeneration from cultured protoplasts is described in Evans et al., <highlight><italic>Handbook of Plant Cell Cultures</italic></highlight>, Vol. 1: (MacMilan Publishing Co. New York, 1983); and Vasil I. R. (ed.), <highlight><italic>Cell Culture and Somatic Cell Genetics of Plants</italic></highlight>, Acad. Press, Orlando, Vol. I, 1984, and Vol. II, 1986). It is known that practically all plants can be regenerated from cultured cells or tissues, including but not limited to, all major species of sugar-cane, sugar beet, cotton, fruit trees, and legumes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Means for regeneration vary from species to species of plants, but generally a suspension of transformed protoplasts or a petri plate containing transformed explants is first provided. Callus tissue is formed and shoots may be induced from callus and subsequently root. Alternatively, somatic embryo formation can be induced in the callus tissue. These somatic embryos germinate as natural embryos to form plants. The culture media will generally contain various amino acids and plant hormones, such as auxin and cytokinins. It is also advantageous to add glutamic acid and proline to the medium, especially for such species as corn and alfalfa. Efficient regeneration will depend on the medium, on the genotype, and on the history of the culture. If these three variables are controlled, then regeneration is usually reproducible and repeatable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> A large number of plants have been shown capable of regeneration from transformed individual cells to obtain transgenic whole plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The regenerated plants selected from those listed are transferred to standard soil conditions and cultivated in a conventional manner. The plants are grown and harvested using conventional procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The particular conditions for transformation, selection and regeneration may be optimized by those of skill in the art. Factors that affect the efficiency of transformation include the species of plant, the tissue infected, composition of the media for tissue culture, selectable marker genes, the length of any of the above-described step, kinds of vectors, and light/dark conditions. Therefore, these and other factors may be varied to determine what is an optimal transformation protocol for any particular plant species. It is recognized that not every species will react in the same manner to the transformation conditions and may require a slightly different modification of the protocols disclosed herein. However, by altering each of the variables, an optimum protocol can be derived for any plant species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The examples, which follow, are set forth to illustrate the present invention, and are not to be construed as limiting thereof. In the following examples, bp means base pair, cDNA means copy DNA, &mgr;g means microgram, ORF means open reading frame, and min means minute. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> This example describes the generation of recombinant A and B vectors of TGMV and CbLCV for introduction into plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> TGMV Vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> TGMV A-derived vectors were constructed using the pMON1655 plasmid, a pUC-based plasmid with 1.5 tandem copies of TGMV A containing the AR1 coding sequence replaced by a short polylinker, and retaining the AR1 promoter and terminator sequences (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). pLVN44 is a full-length 1392 bp cDNA of the nucleotide-binding subunit of magnesium chelatase (su) isolated from <highlight><italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic></highlight>cv. SR1 (Nguyen, <highlight><italic>Transposon tagging and isolation of the sulfur gene in tobacco</italic></highlight>, Ph.D. Thesis, North Carolina State University (1995)). Magnesium chelatase is a multi-subunit protein that catalyzes the insertion of magnesium into protoporphyrin IX (Jensen et al., <highlight><italic>Molec. Gene Genetics </italic></highlight>250:283 (1996)). In tobacco, a mutated allele (Su) of one subunit causes the phenotype known as &lsquo;sulfur&rsquo;. <highlight><italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic></highlight>plants homozygous for this allele are yellow (Su/Su), and heterozygous plants are yellow-green (Su/su). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> To generate a su::gfp fusion gene, a 361 bp fragment, corresponding to nt 627 to 986, of the su cDNA was amplified from pLVN44 with a 5&prime; PCR primer containing an BglII site and a 3&prime; PCR primer containing an XbaI site. A 388 bp fragment, corresponding to nt 130 to 518, of the gfp gene was amplified from mGFP5 template DNA (Haselhoff et al. (1997) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>18:2122-2127) with a 5&prime; PCR primer containing an XbaI site and a 3&prime; PCR primer containing an Acc65I. The pMON1655 plasmid, containing 1.5 copy of TGMV, was restricted with Acc651 and Bgl/III. The gfp and su fragments were three-way ligated into pMON1655 to generate pMT001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> TGMV B vector pTG1.3BXSR (Schaffer et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>214:330-338) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) containing 1.3 tandem, direct repeats of the TGMV B component, was used as a vector for inserting foreign DNA into the B component. The B component encodes two movement proteins, BL1 and BR1. A unique XbaI site was introduced 20 bp downstream of the BR1 ORF for insertion of foreign sequences. This site occurred before the putative BR1 polyadenylation site, allowing for co-transcription of the BR1 gene and the foreign DNA. Post-inoculation into plants, the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>portion of pTG1.3BXSR-derived vectors is excised, resulting in an episomal plasmid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> A plasmid harboring a su::gfp chimeric fragment and plasmids harboring various sizes of the su gene alone were prepared for introduction into plants. Primers containing NheI sites were used to amplify a su::gfp fragment from pMT001 with 58 bp of homology to the su gene and 72-bp of homology to GFP, which was ligated into the Xbal site of pTG1.3BXSR to create plasmid TG1.3B::GFP-su (Table 1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> To construct TGMV B plasmids harboring different-sized fragments of the 1398 bp <highlight><italic>N. tabacum </italic></highlight>su cDNA, pLVN44, harboring the su cDNA, was restricted with three different enzyme combinations and blunt-end cloned into the blunt-ended XbaI site of pTG1.3BXSR. The resulting plasmids, TGMV B::154su, NBsu1455, and NB935, are outlined in Table 1. A 154-bp fragment from the 5&prime; end of the <highlight><italic>N. benthamiana </italic></highlight>su gene was amplified using the following primers containing an XbaI site, 5&prime; gatctagaGGGAGGAAGTTTTATGGAGG 3&prop; (SEQ ID NO:1) and 5&prime; gatctagaTAGCTGCAAATGGATACACCG 3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is required for DNA replication (Nagar et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>7:705 (1995)) and acts as an accessory factor for DNA polymerase delta. The inventors inserted a 180-bp fragment of the pcna gene either (1) singly, (2) as a tandem duplication, or (3) as a 122-bp fragment of the pcna gene into the TGMV B component to determine if a phenotype could be observed.

<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> CbLCV Vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> A plasmid containing the CbLCV A component, with two copies of the common region and two copies of AL1, was constructed by ligating a 1.6-kb EcoRI/HindII fragment from the original clone (provided by Dr. Ernie Hiebert) into similar sites of the polylinker of pBS. The clone from Dr. Hiebert was then used a second time to provide a 1.8-kb fragment by digestion with AatII and EcoRI. First the plasmid was digested with AatII and the ends filled-in to make them blunt (compatible with SmaI). The vector was then digested with EcoRI to produce one sticky and one blunt end. This was ligated to the EcoRI/SmaI sites of the construct containing the 1.6-kb EcoRI/HindII. This construct is called pCLCVA.003 and has a 1.3 tandem direct repeat containing two copies of the common region. The A-derived vector has the AR1 coding sequence replaced by a short polylinker, but retains the AR1 promoter and terminator sequences (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). The fragment of Ch-42 used for silencing in CbLCV was isolated from a PCR fragment generated with primers CH42<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>R (5&prime; ACT GTT AGA TCt TTA GTT GAT CTG 3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:3)) and CH42<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1_L (5&prime; AAT CCC TTC TCT aga AAC CGT AAT CCA ACC 3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:4)). These primers anneal to the open reading frame of Ch-42 at positions 382-405 and 733-762 respectively. Restriction sites were introduced into CH42_R 1 (BglII) and CH42_L<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>1 (XbaI) by introducing mismatches into the primers. The engineered restriction sites are indicated by bold underlined text in the primer sequences, while the mismatches are indicated by lower case letters. The PCR fragment was digested with BglII and XbaI and the resulting fragment ligated into BglII/XbaI digested CbLCV vector (containing the multi-cloning site and no coat protein gene). The resulting clone produces an RNA (from the CbLCV protein promoter) which has a fragment of 353 nucleotides which is completely homologous to the Ch-42 gene (position 394-747 in the Ch-42 open reading frame). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> To make a 1.5 copy tandem, direct-repeat of the B component, CLCVB/pGEMEX-1 (provided by Dr. Ernie Hiebert) was digested with EcoRI/EcoRV. A 1.4-kb fragment was isolated and ligated into EcoRI/SmaI sites of pBluescript SK&plus;II and named pCLCVB.001. CLCVB/pGEMEX-1 was digested a second time with EcoRI releasing one unit-length copy of the viral B genome. This copy was ligated into an EcoRI site of pCpCLCVB.001 to make cCpClCVB.002 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>). Experiments described herein for CbLCV-mediated transformation use plasmids derived from pCpClCVB.002. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> An additional modification was performed to preserve the BR1 stop codon in the CbLCV B vector. pCpClCVB.002 was subsequently digested with Acc651 and SalI, blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment and religated to generate pCpC1CVB.003. This vector was then modified by the addition of a double-stranded linker sequence corresponding to AAGGTACCTT (SEQ ID NO:5) which was blunt-end ligated into pCpCaLCVB.003 digested with at HincII. The resulting vector was sequenced to confirm the Acc651 site and named pNMCLCVB. The additional AA at the 5&prime; end of the linker in SEQ ID NO:5 is needed to preserve the stop codon (TAA) for the BR1 gene. Cloning directly into HincII does not retain the stop codon which reduces silencing.

The BIOLISTIC&reg; Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif., USA) was used to transform Arabidopsis plants. Two different stages of plant development were used in the following experiments. (1) Individual seedlings grown in four-inch plastic pots under short days to promote vegetative growth and well-developed rosettes. (2) Four seedlings on 2.5-cm plates which were transplanted 2 days post-bombardment and then grown under short days. In each experiment, plants were bombarded with microprojectiles coated with equal amounts (5 &mgr;g each) of various combinations of CbLCV A and B plasmid DNAs. The CbLCV B construct alone was used as a negative control, as it cannot replicate without the CbLCV A component. </paragraph>

A 281-bp sequence from the AL1 gene of TGMV was labeled using PCR. Tissues were fixed, embedded in agarose, and vibratome sectioned. Sections were incubated in 1 ng/&mgr;l digoxigenin probe overnight at 37&deg; C., followed by incubation with anti-digoxigenin conjugated alkaline phosphatase and detection in nitoblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-phosphate. Both TGMV-silenced tissue and wild type TGMV tissue were incubated in substrate for 1 h. Immunolocalization of PCNA used monoclonal antibody PC 10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif.) detected using an avidin biotin horseradish peroxidase conjugate with amino-ethylcarbazole substrate (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, Calif.). (Nagar et al. (1995) Plant Cell 7:705-719). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> Meristem culture is a common method for obtaining plants that lack viruses, presumably because viruses are unable to access meristematic tissues. Geminiviruses are not seed transmitted, and although viral DNA is found in the seed coat, embryos are not infected (Sudarshana et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Mol. Plant</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Microbe Interact. </italic></highlight>11:277-291). In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that plant meristematic areas lack geminivirus DNA (Horns and Jeske (1991) <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>181:580-588; Lucy et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. </italic></highlight>9:22-31). To determine if silencing of PCNA occurred in the meristem, or if restriction of PCNA expression in subtending tissues negatively impacted development, immunolocalization of PCNA in infected meristems was performed. Whereas meristems were distinct and easy to dissect in TGMV A::790su/B and wild type TGMV-infected plants, plants infected with pTG1.3B::GFP-su or TGMV A::790su/TGMV B::122PCNA contained numerous leaves, little internode expansion, and aberrant and reduced meristems. Some plants appeared to lack a meristem. Examination of sections from plants that did contain a meristematic structure demonstrated that PCNA expression was greatly reduced in the terminal portions of the apex. Meristems silenced for PCNA lacked detectable leaf primordia (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). There appeared to be a zone of cortical cells extending into the meristem subtended by a layer of cells that contained higher levels of PCNA. Isolated cells or groups of cells in the &ldquo;cortical zone&rdquo; showed PCNA staining (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, panel B and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, panel D, arrows). However, large sectors of the meristem showed very little expression. The meristem remained symmetrical, suggesting that cessation of PCNA expression affected development as well as DNA replication. Together, these observations demonstrated that silencing of the endogenous PCNA gene occurred in meristematic tissue. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Viral DNA Accumulation is Reduced in Silenced Tissue </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Attenuation of symptoms in TGMV-silenced plants suggested that geminivirus-induced silencing could be accomplished with only minor alterations in host gene expression and physiology. Previous results showed that viral DNA accumulation was reduced in TGMV::su silenced plants (Kjemtrup et al. (1998) Plant J. 14:91-100) but did not address the cellular basis of the reduction. To better understand viral infection of silenced tissue, in situ hybridization was used to determine the pattern of viral DNA accumulation in plants systemically infected with TGMV A::790su/B. Viral DNA was detected in isolated cells of green, non-silenced tissue (data not shown) and very rarely in silenced tissue (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, panel B and panel C). Large areas of silenced tissue contained no detectable viral DNA. This pattern contrasted strongly with that of wild type TGMV, which accumulated in clusters of adjacent cells (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, panel A). Viral DNA may still be present at low copy numbers in some cells lacking detectable digoxigenin signal, but the cellular pattern of productive viral replication was clearly different in silenced tissue compared to wild type TGMV-infected tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Although systemic silencing has been readily shown using transgenes (Kjemtrup et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>14:91-100; Ruiz et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>10:937-946; Voinnet and Baulcombe (1997) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>389:553-553; Voinnet et al. (1998) <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>95:177-187), only limited movement of a putative silencing signal has been demonstrated for endogenous genes. Our in situ results for su (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, panel B and panel C) suggested that silencing of su could occur in cells that lacked detectable levels of viral DNA. To further test this idea, we used a mutant TGMV A component that restricts viral DNA replication to vascular tissue in N. benthamiana (Kong et al. (2000 <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>19:3485-3495). Plants inoculated with the mutant TGMV A component and TGMV B::154su showed extensive silencing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Unlike the mutant TGMV (Kong et al. (2000 <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>19:3485-3495), the silencing signal was not restricted to the phloem. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> To determine the shortest sequence necessary to induce silencing, various-sized fragments from the middle of the su gene (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) were cloned into the TGMV A vector and co-bombarded into plants with TGMV B DNA. Minimal silencing was seen when a 51-bp fragment of su (TGMV A::51 su; see Table 1 for nomenclature) was bombarded into plants. Although viral transcription of larger su fragments caused circular yellow spots on bombarded leaves 5 days post-inoculation, no silencing was observed initially in tissue bombarded with TGMV A::51su/B. Instead, variegation was confined to veins in new growth and only some plants showed silencing in three experiments (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, panel A). In contrast, TGVM A::92su/B, containing 41-bp of additional su sequence, consistently caused silencing in every inoculated plant (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, panel B) and produced yellow spots on target tissue. These results demonstrated that 51-bp of homologous sequence is near the lower limit for induction of endogenous gene silencing of su by TGMV A vectors, while a 92-bp fragment was highly effective for silencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> One reason that the TGMV B component may be more effective for silencing is that the TGMV B component vector is co-bombarded with wild type TGMV A, retaining all TGMV genes including the coat protein gene. To test this, plants were inoculated with a su fragment in the TGMV A vector and in the TGMV B vector. Inoculation of TGMV A with a 786-bp fragment of the su gene, replacing the AR1 gene, and with wild type TGMV B resulted in variegation of the inoculated leaves (data not shown). Inoculation with wild type TGMV A and a TGMV B vector, containing a 154-bp su gene fragment (A/TGMV B::154su), resulted in white plants (data not shown). If the coat protein gene were required for extensive spread of the silencing signal, plants inoculated with TGMV A containing the 786-bp fragment of the su gene and TGMV B::154su should have resulted in a variegated phenotype. However, the extent of silencing with 786-bp su gene fragment in conjunction with TGMV B::154su was similar to TGMV B::154su inoculated with wild type A (retaining the AR1 gene). It was concluded that the AR1 gene is not required for extensive spread of the silencing signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> The small size requirement for the induction of silencing prompted the inventors to test various TGMV vector combinations for their ability to silence endogenous plant genes. The inventors first replaced the AR1 open reading frame with a 92-bp fragment of su. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> (panel B) shows an example of the 92-bp su fragment in the TGMV A-derived vector, co-bombarded with wild type TGMV B, could cause silencing in vascular tissue with attenuated symptoms. The inventors then wanted to construct a vector system that would retain expression of all viral genes, and possibly increase the spread of silencing. The same 92-bp su fragment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) was cloned into TGMV B immediately downstream of the BR1 gene such that BR1 and foreign DNA sequences were co-transcribed from the BR1 promoter (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, panel A). Plants inoculated with A/TGMV B::92su showed extensive silencing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, panel A) but developed viral symptoms that included leaf curling and stunting. In contrast, plants inoculated with a fragment containing an additional 62-bp of su (A/TGMV B::154su) showed extensive silencing and minimal symptoms (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, panel B). These plants never outgrew silencing. This fragment was tested in both the sense and antisense orientations in the B component vector. Although systemic silencing was slightly greater in plants inoculated with the sense construct, the difference was not significant (data not shown). Southern blot analysis of total viral DNA accumulation showed that the 92-bp su fragment carried by TGMV B component supported greater TGMV replication (data not shown). To determine if sequence location was important, a 154-bp fragment from the 5&prime; end of the su gene was amplified by PCR and tested for silencing in the TGMV B vector. There were no significant differences in symptom development or extent of silencing between the two fragments (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> For large-scale analysis of gene function, it would be useful to clone variable-sized fragments into the B component. To test the upper limit of stable foreign DNA transmission and silencing 479-bp and 935-bp fragments of the su gene were cloned into the B component vector. These constructs supported significantly less silencing than those carrying 92-154 bp of su sequence (compare <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, panels A-D). Except for bombarded leaves, which had numerous yellow spots, extensive silencing was seen in only one of ten plants and was delayed. PCR analysis of viral DNA isolated from this plant showed that a deletion had occurred that was predicted to decrease the insert size to below 150-bp (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> To confirm that genes other than su could be silenced using the TGMV vector system, plants were infected with wild type TGMV A and TGMV B harboring the pcna gene encoding proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Single and tandem direct repeats of a 180-bp insert homologous to the PCNA gene were subsequently tested. Plants inoculated with a single 180-bp insert lacked symptoms and showed very little DNA accumulation in new growth (data not shown). In contrast, plants inoculated with the tandem repeat showed symptoms resembling wt TGMV, and supported high levels of viral DNA replication. PCR analysis of insert size showed that while a single insert was stable, in every case the tandem repeat was deleted, allowing productive infection of upper leaves (data not shown). Sequence analysis of one of the deleted fragments revealed that fewer than 25 nt retained homology to the original PCNA insert (data not shown). This insertion of a large foreign DNA in the TGMV B vector was destabilizing. DNA was isolated from plants 4 weeks post inoculation with TGMV A/B::180PCNA or A/B::180PCNAtr, containing a tandem direct repeat of a 180-bp PCNA fragment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (Panel A) shows that viral DNA accumulation in new growth of plants inoculated with a single180-bp insert was low compared to plants inoculated with the tandem repeat (360-bp insert). Accumulation of viral DNA from plants inoculated with the B component vector and wild type A was higher than the same vector with insert DNA. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (Panel B) shows PCR products spanning the inserted fragment from each of the plants in the upper plant. The 180-bp insert was stable whereas the tandem repeat (360-bp insert) was deleted. These results demonstrate that there is a narrow range of fragment sizes that can be stably propagated by the TGMV B vector, and that large fragments either prevent viral movement or are deleted. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The AR1 gene encodes the coat protein gene, which is transcribed at high levels. Removal of the AR1 gene in CbLCV allows for up to 800-bp of foreign DNA to be inserted without compromising movement. DNA fragments larger than 1 kb are not stably propagated, and only deleted forms of the CbLCV virus show systemic movement. Conversely, TGMV AR1 deletions move as circular molecules of about 1.7-kb, similar deletions in African Cassava mosaic virus only move in N. benthamiana when wild type size is restored by adding DNA, either from the ACMV A or B components (Klinkenberg et al., <highlight><italic>J. Gen. Virol. </italic></highlight>70, 1873 (1989). ACMV has a similar genetic organization as TGMV and CbLCV. To determine if CbLCV has a strict genome size requirement for movement, the AR1 deletions were tested for movement in <highlight><italic>N. benthamiana</italic></highlight>. AR1 deletions showed systemic movement in both Arabidopsis (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, panel A and B) and N. benthamiana (data not shown), and symptoms were attenuated as compared to wild type CbLCV (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, panel F). Symptoms for the AR1 mutant in Arabidopsis included stunting and curling of the influorescences and leaves (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, panels A and B). Chlorosis was not evident in the AR1 mutant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> It was investigated whether a gene, replacing the AR1 gene in CbLCV A, could silence an endogenous gene of <highlight><italic>N. benthamiana. N. benthamiana </italic></highlight>plants inoculated with a 786-bp su fragment, cloned in sense orientation, into the CbLCV A component showed yellow spots in inoculated leaves. Systemic variegation was also seen, although at markedly-reduced levels compared to TGMV vectors (data not shown). There were no apparent symptoms in new growth suggesting that viral movement may have been impaired. In one plant, silencing appeared in a sectored area, suggestive of viral DNA rearrangement, deletion, or other type of mutation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> To test the silencing of genes in <highlight><italic>A. thaliana</italic></highlight>, an 364-bp antisense Ch-42 fragment cloned into the CbLCV A component (CbLCV A::CH42) was transformed into Arabidopsis plants with fully-developed rosettes. Post-transformation, these plants did not show yellow spots and silencing was not apparent until 3 weeks later, when inflorescence stems appeared. The CbLCV A::CH42-transformed plants (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, panels C and D) lacked chlorophyll, in contrast to stems of plants mock-inoculated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, panel E) and AR1 mutant-inoculated (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, panels A and B). Siliques also lacked chlorophyll and had a strikingly uniform in yellow-white color (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, panel D). Siliques were often bunched, perhaps to due to the virus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> As the stage of plant development may be a factor in transformation, Arabidopsis was transformed at the 4-leaf stage with the CbLCV A::CH42 construct and a wild type B component. It was observed that silencing occurred sooner in plants at the 4-leaf stage (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, panel A); within a week as opposed to 2.5-3 weeks for plants with rosettes and silencing was present in new growth. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> It was investigated whether the CbLCV B component could be used as a silencing vector. A 154-bp fragment of su was cloned into the B component immediately downstream of the BR1 gene. Due to a technical oversight, the stop codon was altered and read through of the BR1 ORF into the su fragment could occur. When bombarded into <highlight><italic>N. benthamiana</italic></highlight>, this vector produced yellow spots but very little systemic silencing (data not shown). The tentative conclusion from this experiment is that the BR1 gene, which is needed for cell-to-cell and long distance movement, is also needed for systemic silencing and was disrupted when the su fragment was inserted into the vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> To test the CbLCV B component in <highlight><italic>A. thaliana</italic></highlight>, a 144-bp fragment of Ch-42 was cloned immediately downstream of the BR1 gene. Inoculation of plants with well-developed rosettes did not produce yellow spots or significant silencing in new growth (data not shown). However, inoculation of seedlings germinated on petri plates and bombarded at the 4-leaf stage did show circular areas of chlorosis that may represent gene silencing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, panel B). New growth in these plants does not appear to show silencing. The plants inoculated with both A and B components did not grow well (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, panels A, C, D) but plants inoculated with only CbLCV A::CH-42 grew well (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, panel B). This was surprising for the CbLCV B::CH-42 plants (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, panel B) because this vector appeared to be compromised for movement due to the insertion of Ch-42 into the open reading frame of the BR1 gene. These plants survived one week before deteriorating, suggesting that the infection and not the transplantation was the problem. It was concluded that CbLCV had a negative effect on Arabidopsis growth. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Silencing of Essential Genes </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a highly conserved processivity factor for DNA polymerase &dgr; that is required for DNA replication and repair, and is highly expressed in dividing cells (Daidoji et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Cell Biochem. Funct. </italic></highlight>10:123-132; Kelman (1997) <highlight><italic>Oncogene </italic></highlight>14:629-640). It has been previously shown that the PCNA gene is induced in mature tissues by TGMV infection (Nagar et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>7:705-719; Egelkrout et al., submitted). Hence, if TGMV silenced a gene required for its own replication, a systemic TGMV infection would be prevented. To determine if TGMV could silence PCNA, plants were transformed with TGMV A::650PCNA/B. Systemic infection was significantly reduced in plants bombarded with this construct, and only 6 of 14 plants showed viral DNA accumulation by DNA gel blot analysis (data not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> When a B component vector was used to propagate a 122-bp PCNA fragment, different results were obtained. Plants showed TGMV symptoms in lower, mature leaves but then showed greatly reduced primary growth (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, panel A). Young leaves continued to expand, forming cabbage-like clusters at the apical meristems (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, panel A). Leaves were often misshapen with truncated basipetal growth and little or no petiole development. These results suggested that, unlike the A vector carrying PCNA, the B vector caused silencing of PCNA expression in young tissue. This difference between the TGMV A and B vectors was not expected, but is consistent with the extensive spread of su silencing seen using the B component vector compared to A (compare <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Knockout mutations may not produce a detectable phenotype if the genes have redundant functions. A rapid test for silencing combinations of genes may help to elucidate these kinds of relationships. To determine whether a single episomal silencing vector can target two different chromosomal genes, a combination of sequences designed to silence both the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) and su were tested. A chimeric foreign DNA sequence consisting of 361 bp of su gene sequence and 388-bp of gfp gene sequence was cloned into a TGMV A vector as an AR1 gene replacement resulting in vector MT0001. Transgenic plants expressing a CaMV 35S-gfp gene were inoculated with MT0001 vector. Inoculated leaves had yellow spots, indicative of su silencing, surrounded by a larger region of gfp silencing, seen under UV illumination as a region of red chlorophyll fluorescence (data not shown). Silencing of two genes from the TGMV B vector was tested using a 140-bp chimeric DNA insert consisting of 58-bp homologous to su and 72-bp homologous to GFP. Silencing of both su and GFP was detected following bombardment into N. benthamiana carrying a CaMV 35S-GFP transgene. GFP silencing occurred throughout the plant, whereas su silencing was variable and reduced compared to GFP (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, left plant, Panels A and B). These results demonstrate that two genes can be silenced simultaneously from the same episomal DNA construct. Similar results were obtained using a chimeric fragment inserted as an AR1 replacement in TGMV A (data not shown). In this case the fragment contained 400-bp of homology with GFP and 390-bp of homology to su. Although GFP silencing generally extended throughout the plant, su silencing was not extensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> A rapid means for simultaneously silencing defined combinations of genes in intact plants would help to identify genes with redundant function. To determine whether a bipartite episomal silencing vector can target two endogenous plant genes from different components, a combination of sequences designed to silence PCNA and su, two genes essential for plant growth, were tested. An A component vector with 790-bp su was co-bombarded with a B component vector carrying a 122-bp PCNA fragment. Symptom formation from TGMV A::790su/B::122PCNA during the first 2-3 weeks resembled those of TGMV A::790su/B with yellow spots in inoculated leaves and variegated tissue in upper leaves. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, panel A shows an example of a plant in which the apical meristem terminated primary growth, due to silencing of PCNA. Inoculated leaves showed yellow spots and remained green while upper leaves were variegated, and showed progressively reduced expansion.

Control plants inoculated at the same time with TGMV A::790su/B were similarly pruned but axillary branch development was normal (data not shown). Extensive su silencing also occurred in some axillary bud leaf clusters of plants inoculated with TGMV A::790su/B::122PCNA, while only variegated tissue was present in others (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, panel B). This range of silencing phenotypes on the same plant may reflect differential movement of diffusible silencing components. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Silencing of two genes from the B component of CbLCV vector was also tested. Transgenic plants expressing a CaMV 35S-gfp gene were inoculated with the CbLCV A vector containing: (1) a coat protein deletion (-AR1), (2) a 364-bp fragment of Ch-42, (3) a 400-bp fragment of gfp, or (4) an a chimeric Ch-42::gfp fragment (CbLCV::CH42-GFP). As a control, trangenic plants were mock-inoculated to demonstrate a healthy plant (upper and lower panel, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, panel A). Plants inoculated with CbLCV A::GFP exhibited a reduction in GFP fluorescence (lower panel, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, panel C) compared to mock-inoculated and CbLCV A (-AR1)-inoculated plants (lower panel, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, panels A and B) and only red autofluorescence from chlorophyll was seen (upper panel, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, panel C). Silencing of Ch-42 was evident by yellowing of inoculated leaves (upper panel, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, panel D) compared to no yellowing in a mock-inoculated plant (upper panel, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, panel A). Simultaneous silencing of both gfp and Ch-42 in plants inoculated with CbLCV::CH42-GFP, was evident by a lack of chlorophyll in inoculated leaves (upper panel, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, panel E) and a lack of GFP fluorescence (lower panel, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, panel E). These results provide a visual demonstration that two genes can be silenced simultaneously from one DNA construct. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Systemic-Acquired Silencing and Anti-Silencing </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> Recently, silencing caused by diffusible factors capable of moving between cells has been reported (Palauqui et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>16: 4738 (1997); Voinnet and Baulcombe, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>389: 553 (1997)). Evidence for a phloem-mobile component involved in post-transcriptional silencing was provided by graft transmissibility experiments (Voinnet and Baulcombe, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>389: 553 (1997)). These same investigators showed that a post-transcriptionally silenced transgene expressed from the CaMV 35S promoter could provide a self-perpetuating silencing factor (Anandalakshmi et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. </italic></highlight>95:13079 (1998). Grafting experiments demonstrated that while either an endogenous or a 35S promoter transgene, if silenced post-transcriptionally, could transmit a factor that spread silencing to other tissue, only the 35S promoter transgene was able to act as a source of the factor required to establish post-transcriptional gene silencing de novo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> Introduction of sequences for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) into a single leaf of a transgenic GFP plant using Agrobacterium infiltration caused silencing of the GFP gene in upper leaves remote from the site of infiltration (Palauqui et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>16: 4738 (1997)). These same transgenic GFP plants were able to outgrow a cytoplasmically-localized PVX-GFP viral infection (Palauqui et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>16: 4738 (1997)) perhaps because the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) machinery degraded all copies of the PVX-GFP construct. The authors concluded that gene silencing and viral resistance are functionally related. The inventors infected similar transgenic GFP N. benthamiana plants with a TGMV A component carrying the full-length gfp gene in the sense orientation, replacing the coat protein gene (TGMV A::gfp). Silencing of GFP was achieved, but the transgenic GFP plants were not cured of the TGMV A::gfp construct (data not shown). It was concluded that as geminiviruses, unlike the PVX virus, replicate in the nucleus they may be protected from the viral resistance machinery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> As a counter-measure to the plant&apos;s gene silencing/viral resistance machinery, viruses have developed anti-silencing mechanisms. Two RNA viruses have recently been shown to encode anti-silencing proteins. Tobacco etch virus encodes a P1/HC-Pro polyprotein that can reverse PTGS (Brigneti et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>17:6739 (1998); Kasschau and Carrington, <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>95: 461 (1998); Beclin et al., <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>252: 313 (1998)). Cucumber mosaic virus contains a protein 2b that appears to inhibit the initiation of PTGS in new growth (Kasschau and Carrington, Cell 95: 461 (1998). Cucumber mosaic virus, but not tomato black ring nepovirus, prevents PTGS of an endogenous gene and a transgene (Kenton et al.,. Chromosome Res. 3: 346 (1995). These recent results provide strong evidence that gene silencing is part of the plant defense response to viral infection, and that viruses have evolved counter-defense strategies. A mutant form of the TGMV A component was identified that may separate the viral anti-silencing signal from the diffusible silencing signal. This mutant form of the A component is a Leu<highlight><subscript>148</subscript></highlight>&rarr;Ala149 conversion which confers a higher level of DNA replication and possibly restricts the virus to the phloem tissue (Kong, L. J., et al, (2000) <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>19:3485-3495). When the mutant is transformed into N. benthamiana, in conjunction with a TGMV B component containing a 154-bp fragment of su (TGMV B::154su), the plants exhibit a higher degree of silencing (left plant, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) than plants transformed with a wild type A component and TGMV B::154su (right plant, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). It was concluded that by restricting the virus to the phloem, the diffusible silencing signal is physically-separated from the viral anti-silencing signal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Geminivirus-Mediated Silencing in Canola </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> A cabbage leaf curl virus A component vector carrying a 400 bp Arabidopsis CH-42 gene fragment, which encodes a subunit of magnesium chelatase required for chlorophyll formation, were used to inoculate canola (<highlight><italic>Brassica napus</italic></highlight>). The CH-42 sequence replaced part of the coding sequence for the CbLCV AR1 protein. Canola is in the same family as Arabidopsis and the same genus as cabbage. Compared with Arabidopsis, limited evidence of silencing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>) was observed but the extent of homology between the 400 bp Arabidopsis CH-42 gene and the <highlight><italic>B. napus </italic></highlight>CH-42 gene is undetermined, and may not have been high enough to induce silencing. Arrows in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> indicate mild symptoms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> DNA gel blots probed with cabbage leaf curl virus showed that input DNA from microprojectile bombardment remained on the surface of the leaves. Replication of the silencing vector was demonstrated by digesting with DpnI, an enzyme that digests DNA made in <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, but not in plants. The smaller bands seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference> show the vector after it has replicated. The larger bands in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference> show the vector carried by input plasmid DNA. Lane 8 is the control and contains canola DNA that was mock-bombarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> These results indicate that a CbLCV silencing vector can replicate in canola. Moreover, no pathogenicity was observed in inoculated canola plants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Canola plants are modified to stably integrate a green fluorescent protein (gfp) transgene. A CbLCV A component silencing vector is constructed in which a portion of the AR1 coding sequence is replaced with a fragment of the gfp gene in the sense or antisense direction. This CbLCV A::gfp vector is inoculated into the transgenic canola plants stably expressing the gfp transgene. The plants are allowed to grow for a period of time and are then observed for gfp silencing. </paragraph>
